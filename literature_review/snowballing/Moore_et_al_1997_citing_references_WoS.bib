Abstract = {{Individuals should alter when they socially associate with conspecifics
   to avoid potentially costly interactions. Moreover, individuals may vary
   in their propensity to use information about conspecifics when making
   such social decisions. However, surprisingly little is known about
   either the determinants of or the individual variation in such ``social
   plasticity.{''} We show here that eastern water dragons (Intellegama
   lesueurii lesueurii) may simultaneously use information from different
   components of their social environment when deciding whether to socially
   associate. In particular, we found that individuals altered when they
   socially associated with conspecifics according to the levels of
   potential conflict and competition in their social environment; both
   sexes socially associated more at higher local density than would be
   expected under increased random encounters. Further, females were more
   likely to socially associate during the breeding season and when there
   were more males and/or conspecifics whom they typically avoided in their
   social environment. This suggests that females may seek safety in
   numbers when the potential for intrasexual conflict or sexual harassment
   is high. Using a behavioral reaction norm framework, we also provide
   novel evidence to show that individuals vary in the extent and direction
   of their social plasticity and that males varied more than females. Our
   study thus implies that individuals use multiple cues in their
   environment when deciding to socially associate and that the resulting
   social plasticity varies between the sexes and between individuals.}},

Title = {{Conditional expression explains molecular evolution of social genes in a
   microbe}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Conflict is thought to play a critical role in the evolution of social
   interactions by promoting diversity or driving accelerated evolution.
   However, despite our sophisticated understanding of how conflict shapes
   social traits, we have limited knowledge of how it impacts molecular
   evolution across the underlying social genes. Here we address this
   problem by analyzing the genome-wide impact of social interactions using
   genome sequences from 67 Dictyostelium discoideum strains. We find that
   social genes tend to exhibit enhanced polymorphism and accelerated
   evolution. However, these patterns are not consistent with conflict
   driven processes, but instead reflect relaxed purifying selection. This
   pattern is most likely explained by the conditional nature of social
   interactions, whereby selection on genes expressed only in social
   interactions is diluted by generations of inactivity. This dilution of
   selection by inactivity enhances the role of drift, leading to increased
   polymorphism and accelerated evolution, which we call the Red King
   process.}},

Title = {{Social runaway: Fisherian elaboration (or reduction) of socially
   selected traits via indirect genetic effects}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Abstract = {{Our understanding of the evolutionary stability of socially selected
   traits is dominated by sexual selection models originating with R. A.
   Fisher, in which genetic covariance arising through assortative mating
   can trigger exponential, runaway trait evolution. To examine whether
   nonreproductive, socially selected traits experience similar
   dynamics-social runaway-when assortative mating does not automatically
   generate a covariance, we modeled the evolution of socially selected
   badge and donation phenotypes incorporating indirect genetic effects
   (IGEs) arising from the social environment. We establish a social
   runaway criterion based on the interaction coefficient, psi, which
   describes social effects on badge and donation traits. Our models make
   several predictions. (1) IGEs can drive the original evolution of
   altruistic interactions that depend on receiver badges. (2) Donation
   traits are more likely to be susceptible to IGEs than badge traits. (3)
   Runaway dynamics in nonsexual, social contexts can occur in the absence
   of a genetic covariance. (4) Traits elaborated by social runaway are
   more likely to involve reciprocal, but nonsymmetrical, social
   plasticity. Models incorporating plasticity to the social environment
   via IGEs illustrate conditions favoring social runaway, describe a
   mechanism underlying the origins of costly traits, such as altruism, and
   support a fundamental role for phenotypic plasticity in rapid social
   evolution.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{Socially affected traits are affected by direct genetic effects (DGE)
   and social genetic effects (SGE). DGE and SGE of an individual directly
   quantify the genetic influence of its own phenotypes and the phenotypes
   of other individuals, respectively. In the current study, a total of
   3,276 Large White pigs from different pens were used, and each pen
   contained 10 piglets. DGE and SGE were estimated for six socially
   affected traits, and then a GWAS was conducted to identify SNPs
   associated with DGE and SGE. Based on the whole-genome re-sequencing, 40
   Large White pigs were genotyped and 10,501,384 high quality SNPs were
   retained for single-locus and multi-locus GWAS. For single-locus GWAS, a
   total of 54 SNPs associated with DGE and 33 SNPs with SGE exceeded the
   threshold (P < 5.00E-07) were detected for six growth traits. Of these,
   22 SNPs with pleiotropic effects were shared by DGE and SGE. For
   multi-locus GWAS, a total of 72 and 110 putative QTNs were detected for
   DGE and SGE, respectively. Of these, 5 SNPs with pleiotropic effects
   were shared by DGE and SGE. It is noteworthy that 2 SNPs (SSC8: 16438396
   for DGE and SSC17: 9697454 for SGE) were detected in single-locus and
   multi-locus GWAS. Furthermore, 15 positional candidate genes shared by
   SGE and DGE were identified because of their roles in behaviour, health
   and disease. Identification of genetic variants and candidate genes for
   DGE and SGE for socially affected traits will provide a new insight to
   understand the genetic architecture of socially affected traits in pigs.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The environment changes constantly at various time scales and, in order
   to survive, species need to keep adapting. Whether these species succeed
   in avoiding extinction is a major evolutionary question. Using a
   multilocus evolutionary model of a mutation-limited population adapting
   under strong selection, we investigate the effects of the frequency of
   environmental fluctuations on adaptation. Our results rely on an
   ``adaptive-walk{''} approximation and use mathematical methods from
   evolutionary computation theory to investigate the interplay between
   fluctuation frequency, the similarity of environments, and the number of
   loci contributing to adaptation. First, we assume a linear additive
   fitness function, but later generalize our results to include several
   types of epistasis. We show that frequent environmental changes prevent
   populations from reaching a fitness peak, but they may also prevent the
   large fitness loss that occurs after a single environmental change.
   Thus, the population can survive, although not thrive, in a wide range
   of conditions. Furthermore, we show that in a frequently changing
   environment, the similarity of threats that a population faces affects
   the level of adaptation that it is able to achieve. We check and
   supplement our analytical results with simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological variation in resources can influence the distribution and
   encounter rates of potential mates and competitors and, consequently,
   the opportunity for sexual selection. Factors that influence the
   likelihood that females mate multiply could also affect the potential
   for sperm competition. In Wellington tree weta (Hemideina crassidens,
   plural ``weta{''}), the size of tree cavities (called galleries) used as
   refuges affects weta distribution and thus the opportunity for sexual
   selection and selection on male weaponry size. We examined the predicted
   effects of gallery size and male weaponry size on the potential for
   sperm competition. We asked if gallery size influenced the potential for
   multiple mating by females and potential for sperm competition, if male
   weaponry size was associated with relative expected sperm competition
   intensity (SCI), and if estimated male mating success was correlated
   with potential SCI. To quantify relative competitive environments of
   males, we created and analyzed networks of potential competitors based
   on which males could have mated with the same females. We found that
   small galleries had higher potential for female multiple mating and
   higher potential for sperm competition. Size of male weaponry was not
   associated with expected relative SCI. Regardless of gallery size, males
   with more potential mates were expected to face lower expected relative
   sperm competition. Thus, in this system, variation in the size of
   available refuges is likely to influence the potential for sperm
   competition, in a way that we might expect to increase variation in
   overall reproductive success.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{559-571}},

Abstract = {{Organisms can affect one another's phenotypes when they socially
   interact. Indirect genetic effects occur when an individual's phenotype
   is affected by genes expressed in another individual. These heritable
   effects can enhance or reduce adaptive potential, thereby accelerating
   or reversing evolutionary change. Quantifying these social effects is
   therefore crucial for our understanding of evolution, yet estimates of
   indirect genetic effects in wild animals are limited to dyadic
   interactions. We estimated indirect phenotypic and genetic effects, and
   their covariance with direct effects, for the date of spring breeding in
   North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) living in an
   array of territories of varying spatial proximity. Additionally, we
   estimated indirect effects and the strength of selection at low and high
   population densities. Social effects of neighbours on the date of spring
   breeding were different from zero at high population densities but not
   at low population densities. Indirect phenotypic effects accounted for a
   larger amount of variation in the date of breeding than differences
   attributable to the among-individual variance, suggesting social
   interactions are important for determining breeding dates. The genetic
   component to these indirect effects was however not statistically
   significant. We therefore showcase a powerful and flexible method that
   will allow researchers working in organisms with a range of social
   systems to estimate indirect phenotypic and genetic effects, and
   demonstrate the degree to which social interactions can influence
   phenotypes, even in a solitary species.}},

Title = {{Models with indirect genetic effects depending on group sizes: a
   simulation study assessing the precision of the estimates of the
   dilution parameter}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{51}},
Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: In settings with social interactions, the phenotype of an
   individual is affected by the direct genetic effect (DGE) of the
   individual itself and by indirect genetic effects (IGE) of its group
   mates. In the presence of IGE, heritable variance and response to
   selection depend on size of the interaction group (group size), which
   can be modelled via a `dilution' parameter (d) that measures the
   magnitude of IGE as a function of group size. However, little is known
   about the estimability of d and the precision of its estimate. Our aim
   was to investigate how precisely d can be estimated and what determines
   this precision.
   Methods: We simulated data with different group sizes and estimated d
   using a mixed model that included IGE and d. Schemes included various
   average group sizes (4, 6, and 8), variation in group size (coefficient
   of variation (CV) ranging from 0.125 to 1.010), and three values of d
   (0, 0.5, and 1). A design in which individuals were randomly allocated
   to groups was used for all schemes and a design with two families per
   group was used for some schemes. Parameters were estimated using
   restricted maximum likelihood(REML). Bias and precision of estimates
   were used to assess their statistical quality.
   Results: The dilution parameter of IGE can be estimated for simulated
   data with variation in group size. For all schemes, the length of
   confidence intervals ranged from 0.114 to 0.927 for d, from 0.149 to
   0.198 for variance of DGE, from 0.011 to 0.086 for variance of IGE, and
   from 0.310 to 0.557 for genetic correlation between DGE and IGE. To
   estimate d, schemes with groups composed of two families performed
   slightly better than schemes with randomly composed groups.
   Conclusions: Dilution of IGE was estimable, and in general its
   estimation was more precise when CV of group size was larger. All
   estimated parameters were unbiased. Estimation of dilution of IGE allows
   the contribution of direct and indirect variance components to heritable
   variance to be quantified in relation to group size and, thus, it could
   improve prediction of the expected response to selection in environments
   with group sizes that differ from the average size.}},

Abstract = {{Winning or losing contests can impact subsequent competitive behaviour
   and the duration of these effects can be prolonged. While it is clear
   effects depend on social and developmental environments, the extent to
   which they are heritable, and hence evolvable, is less clear and remains
   untested. Furthermore, theory predicts that winner and loser effects
   should evolve independently of actual fighting ability, but again tests
   of this prediction are limited. Here we used artificial selection on
   replicated beetle populations to show that the duration of loser effects
   can evolve, with a realized heritability of about 17\%. We also find
   that naive fighting ability does not co-evolve with reductions in the
   duration of the loser effect. We discuss the implications of these
   findings and how they corroborate theoretical predictions.}},

Pages = {{505-518}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We generally expect traits to evolve in the same direction as selection.
   However, many organisms possess traits that appear to be costly for
   individuals, while plant and animal breeding experiments reveal that
   selection may lead to no response or even negative responses to
   selection. We formalize both of these instances as cases of ``opposite
   responses to selection.{''} Using quantitative genetic models for the
   response to selection, we outline when opposite responses to selection
   should be expected. These typically occur when social selection opposes
   direct selection, when individuals interact with others less related to
   them than a random member of the population, and if the genetic
   covariance between direct and indirect effects is negative. We discuss
   the likelihood of each of these occurring in nature and therefore
   summarize how frequent opposite responses to selection are likely to be.
   This links several evolutionary phenomena within a single framework.}},

Title = {{Transcriptomic basis and evolution of the ant nurse-larval social
   interactome}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Development is often strongly regulated by interactions among close
   relatives, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown.
   In eusocial insects, interactions between caregiving worker nurses and
   larvae regulate larval development and resultant adult phenotypes. Here,
   we begin to characterize the social interactome regulating ant larval
   development by collecting and sequencing the transcriptomes of
   interacting nurses and larvae across time. We find that the majority of
   nurse and larval transcriptomes exhibit parallel expression dynamics
   across larval development. We leverage this widespread nurse-larva gene
   co-expression to infer putative social gene regulatory networks acting
   between nurses and larvae. Genes with the strongest inferred social
   effects tend to be peripheral elements of within-tissue regulatory
   networks and are often known to encode secreted proteins. This includes
   interesting candidates such as the nurse-expressed giant-lens, which may
   influence larval epidermal growth factor signaling, a pathway known to
   influence various aspects of insect development. Finally, we find that
   genes with the strongest signatures of social regulation tend to
   experience relaxed selective constraint and are evolutionarily young.
   Overall, our study provides a first glimpse into the molecular and
   evolutionary features of the social mechanisms that regulate all aspects
   of social life.
   Author summary Social interactions are fundamental to all forms of life,
   from single-celled bacteria to complex plants and animals. Despite their
   obvious importance, little is known about the molecular causes and
   consequences of social interactions. In this paper, we study the
   molecular basis of nurse-larva social interactions that regulate larval
   development in the pharaoh ant Monomorium pharaonis. We infer the
   effects of social interactions on gene expression from samples of nurses
   and larvae collected in the act of interaction across a developmental
   time series. Gene expression appears to be closely tied to these
   interactions, such that we can identify genes expressed in nurses with
   putative regulatory effects on larval gene expression. Genes which we
   infer to have strong social regulatory effects tend to have weak
   regulatory effects within individuals, and highly social genes tend to
   experience relatively weaker natural selection in comparison to fewer
   social genes. This study represents a novel approach and foundation upon
   which future studies at the intersection of genetics, behavior, and
   evolution can build.}},

Abstract = {{Populations at risk of extinction due to climate change may be rescued
   by adaptive evolution or plasticity. Selective agents, such as
   introduced predators, may enhance or constrain plastic or adaptive
   responses to temperature. We tested responses of Daphnia to temperature
   by collecting populations from lakes across an elevational gradient in
   the presence and absence of fish predators (long-term selection). We
   subsequently grew these populations at two elevations in field mesocosms
   over two years (short-term selection), followed by a common-garden
   experiment at two temperatures in the lab to measure life-history
   traits. Both long-term and short-term selection affected traits,
   suggesting that genetic variation of plasticity within populations
   enabled individuals to rapidly evolve plasticity in response to high
   temperature. We found that short-term selection by high temperature
   increased plasticity for growth rate in all populations. Fecundity was
   higher in populations from fishless lakes and body size showed greater
   plasticity in populations from warm lakes (long-term selection). Neither
   body size nor fecundity were affected by short-term thermal selection.
   These results demonstrate that plasticity is an important component of
   the life-history response of Daphnia, and that genetic variation within
   populations enabled rapid evolution of plasticity in response to
   selection by temperature.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental part of the quantitative genetic theory deals with the
   partitioning of the phenotypic variance into additive genetic and
   environmental components. During interaction with conspecifics, the
   interaction partner becomes a part of the environment from the
   perspective of the focal individual. If the interaction effects have a
   genetic basis, they are called indirect genetic effects (IGEs) and can
   evolve along with direct genetic effects. Sexual reproduction is a
   classic context where potential conflict between males and females can
   arise from trade-offs between current and future investments. We studied
   five female fecundity traits, egg length and number, egg pod length and
   number and latency to first egg pod, and estimated the direct and IGEs
   using a half-sib breeding design in the grasshopper Chorthippus
   biguttulus. We found that the male IGEs were an order of magnitude lower
   than the direct genetic effects and were not significantly different
   from zero. However, there was some indication that IGEs were larger
   shortly after mating, consistent with the idea that IGEs fade with time
   after interaction. Female direct heritabilities were moderate to low.
   Simulation shows that the variance component estimates can appear larger
   with less data, calling for care when interpreting variance components
   estimated with low power. Our results illustrate that the contribution
   of male IGEs is overall low on the phenotypic variance of female
   fecundity traits. Thus, even in the relevant context of sexual conflict,
   the influence of male IGEs on the evolutionary trajectory of female
   reproductive traits is likely to be small.}},

Abstract = {{Despite serving the primary objective of ensuring that at least one
   sperm cell reaches and fertilises an ovum, the male ejaculate (i.e.
   spermatozoa and seminal fluid) is a compositionally complex `trait' that
   can respond phenotypically to subtle changes in conditions. In
   particular, recent research has shown that environmentally and
   genetically induced changes to ejaculates can have implications for
   offspring traits that are independent of the DNA sequence encoded into
   the sperm's haploid genome. In this review, we compile evidence from
   several disciplines and numerous taxonomic systems to reveal the extent
   of such ejaculate-mediated paternal effects (EMPEs). We consider a
   number of environmental and genetic factors that have been shown to
   impact offspring phenotypes via ejaculates, and where possible, we
   highlight the putative mechanistic pathways by which ejaculates can act
   as conduits for paternal effects. We also highlight how females
   themselves can influence EMPEs, and in some cases, how maternally
   derived sources of variance may confound attempts to test for EMPEs.
   Finally, we consider a range of putative evolutionary implications of
   EMPEs and suggest a number of potentially useful approaches for

Abstract = {{Interactions between organisms are ubiquitous and have important
   consequences for phenotypes and fitness. Individuals can even influence
   those they never meet, if they have extended phenotypes that alter the
   environments others experience. North American red squirrels
   (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) guard food hoards, an extended phenotype that
   typically outlives the individual and is usually subsequently acquired
   by non-relatives. Hoarding by previous owners can, therefore, influence
   subsequent owners. We found that red squirrels breed earlier and had
   higher lifetime fitness if the previous hoard owner was a male. This was
   driven by hoarding behaviour, as males and mid-aged squirrels had the
   largest hoards, and these effects persisted across owners, such that if
   the previous owner was male or died in mid-age, subsequent occupants had
   larger hoards. Individuals can, therefore, influence each other's
   resource-dependent traits and fitness without ever meeting, such that
   the past can influence contemporary population dynamics through extended
   phenotypes.}},

Title = {{Incubation temperature and social context affect the nest exodus of

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{518-527}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{The environments that animals experience during development have
   important fitness consequences. In birds, parents influence the
   developmental environment of their offspring through incubation. Subtle
   changes in incubation temperature affect offspring morphology and
   physiology, such as growth, immune function, and thermoregulation, yet
   little is known about how it may affect critical early-life behaviors.
   Because expression of behavior can be influenced by the social
   environment, the effect of incubation temperature on behavior may be
   context-dependent. We investigated whether incubation temperature and
   social context influence a critical early-life task in wood ducks (Aix
   sponsa). Wood ducks nest in tree cavities and, shortly after hatching,
   ducklings must jump and climb out of the cavity. Failure to exit the
   nest is fatal. In 2 experiments, we incubated eggs at different mean
   temperatures and examined the nest exodus of ducklings individually and
   in mixed-incubation temperature pairs. When tested individually,
   ducklings incubated at 35.8 degrees C and 37.0 degrees C were similar to
   2.5 times more successful at exiting the nest, and jumped and climbed
   more often, than those incubated at 35.0 degrees C. However, in an
   experiment conducted the following year, we found that social
   interactions mitigated these effects and there was no difference in nest
   exodus success when ducklings incubated at 35.0 degrees C and 36.0
   degrees C were tested together in pairs. This may be because, when in
   pairs, ducklings incubated at the low-temperature experience social
   enhancement whereas those incubated at the high temperature maintain
   similar behaviors. These results advance our understanding of how
   parental effects influence offspring behaviors and performance within
   different social contexts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a critical analysis of genetically informed research
   on relationships, with an emphasis on relationships among unrelated
   individuals (e.g., spouses). To date, research in this area has used
   traditional behavioral genetic frameworks to either partition the
   variance in relationship-related outcomes into genetic and environmental
   components, or to examine gene-environment interplay between
   relationship factors and other outcomes. However, this conventional
   approach is at odds with the long-standing understanding from the field
   of relationship science that both partners' characteristics matter when
   predicting shared outcomesthat is, outcomes that are emergent. We
   examine briefly the philosophical concept of emergence, and discuss ways
   to model dyadic outcomes in genetically informed relationships research.
   We also review the related topic of social genetic effects, which refer
   to the influence of a social partner's genotype on a proband's
   phenotype. A genetically informed dyadic perspective has potentially
   important consequences for our understanding of the pathways from
   genotypeshared or individual-level phenotypes, and more fully recognizes
   the complexity of how genetic and social/environmental factors come
   together to influence human behavior.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions can give rise to indirect genetic effects (IGEs),
   which occur when genes expressed in one individual affect the phenotype
   of another individual. The evolutionary dynamics of traits can be
   altered when there are IGEs. Sex often involves indirect effects arising
   from first-order (current) or second-order (prior) social interactions,
   yet IGEs are infrequently quantified for reproductive behaviors. Here,
   we use experimental populations of burying beetles that have experienced
   bidirectional selection on mating rate to test for social plasticity and
   IGEs associated with focal males mating with a female either without
   (first-order effect) or with (second-order effect) prior exposure to a
   competitor, and resource defense behavior (first-order effect). Additive
   IGEs were detected for mating rate arising from (first-order)
   interactions with females. For resource defense behavior, a standard
   variance partitioning analysis provided no evidence of additive genetic
   varianceeither direct or indirect. However, behavior was predicted by
   focal size relative to that of the competitor, and size is also
   heritable. Assuming that behavior is causally dependent on relative
   size, this implies that both DGEs and IGEs do occur (and may potentially
   interact). The relative contribution of IGEs may differ among social
   behaviors related to mating which has consequences for the evolutionary
   trajectories of multivariate traits.}},

Abstract = {{Social immunity moderates the spread of pathogens in social groups and
   is especially likely in groups structured by genetic relatedness. The
   extent to which specific immune pathways are used is unknown. Here, we
   investigate the expression and social role of three functionally
   separate immune genes (pgrp-sc2, thaumatin, and defensin) during
   parental care in the beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. These genes reside
   in different immune pathways, allowing us to test whether specific
   components of the immune system are targeted for social immunity. To
   test for the evolution of specificity, we manipulated the influence of
   social context and timing on gene expression and quantified the
   covariance of maternal immune gene expression and offspring fitness.
   Larvae reduced expression of all three genes in the presence of parents.
   Parental pgrp-sc2 and thaumatin increased during direct parenting, while
   defensin was upregulated before larvae arrived. Parental expression of
   pgrp-sc2 and thaumatin responded similarly to experimental manipulation
   of timing and presence of larvae, which differed from the response of
   defensin. We found a positive covariance between maternal expression and
   offspring fitness for pgrp-sc2 and thaumatin but not defensin. We
   suggest that social immunity can involve specific genes and pathways,
   reflecting evolution as an interacting phenotype during parenting.}},

Pages = {{4-14}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{There are many situations in nature where we expect traits to evolve but
   not necessarily for mean fitness to increase. However, these scenarios
   are hard to reconcile simultaneously with Fisher's fundamental theorem
   of natural selection (FTNS) and the Price identity (PI). The
   consideration of indirect genetic effects (IGEs) on fitness reconciles
   these fundamental theorems with the observation that traits sometimes
   evolve without any adaptation by explicitly considering the correlated
   evolution of the social environment, which is a form of transmission
   bias. Although environmental change is often assumed to be absent when
   using the PI, here we show that explicitly considering IGEs as change in
   the social environment with implications for fitness has several
   benefits: (1) it makes clear how traits can evolve while mean fitness
   remains stationary, (2) it reconciles the FTNS with the evolution of
   maladaptation, (3) it explicitly includes density-dependent fitness
   through negative social effects that depend on the number of interacting
   conspecifics, and (4) it allows mean fitness to evolve even when direct
   genetic variance in fitness is zero, if related individuals interact
   and/or if there is multilevel selection. In summary, considering fitness
   in the context of IGEs aligns important theorems of natural selection
   with many situations observed in nature and provides a useful lens
   through which we might better understand evolution and adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{The infection of cells by multiple copies of a given virus can impact
   viral evolution in a variety of ways, yet some of the most basic
   evolutionary dynamics remain underexplored. Using computational models,
   we investigate how infection multiplicity affects the fixation
   probability of mutants, the rate of mutant generation, and the timing of
   mutant invasion. An important insight from these models is that for
   neutral and disadvantageous phenotypes, rare mutants initially enjoy a
   fitness advantage in the presence of multiple infection of cells. This
   arises because multiple infection allows the rare mutant to enter more
   target cells and to spread faster, while it does not accelerate the
   spread of the resident wild-type virus. The rare mutant population can
   increase by entry into both uninfected and wild-type-infected cells,
   while the established wild-type population can initially only grow
   through entry into uninfected cells. Following this initial advantageous
   phase, the dynamics are governed by drift or negative selection,
   respectively, and a higher multiplicity reduces the chances that mutants
   fix in the population. Hence, while increased infection multiplicity
   promotes the presence of neutral and disadvantageous mutants in the
   short-term, it makes it less likely in the longer term. We show how
   these theoretical insights can be useful for the interpretation of
   experimental data on virus evolution at low and high multiplicities. The
   dynamics explored here provide a basis for the investigation of more
   complex viral evolutionary processes, including recombination,
   reassortment, as well as complementary/inhibitory interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Parental care is found widely across animal taxa and is manifest in a
   range of behaviours from basic provisioning in cockroaches to highly
   complex behaviours seen in mammals. The evolution of parental care is
   viewed as the outcome of an evolutionary cost/benefit trade-off between
   investing in current and future offspring, leading to the selection of
   traits in offspring that influence parental behaviour. Thus, level and
   quality of parental care are affected by both parental and offspring
   genetic differences that directly and indirectly influence parental care
   behaviour. While significant research effort has gone into understanding
   how parental genomes affect parental, and mostly maternal, behaviour,
   few studies have investigated how offspring genomes affect parental
   care. In this review, we bring together recent findings across different
   fields focussing on the mechanism and genetics of offspring effects on
   maternal care in mammals.}},

Abstract = {{Space use including territoriality and spatial arrangement within a
   population can reveal important information on the nature, dynamics, and
   evolutionary maintenance of alternative strategies in color polymorphic
   species. Despite the prevalence of color polymorphic species as model
   systems in evolutionary biology, the interaction between space use and
   genetic structuring of morphs within populations has rarely been
   examined. Here, we assess the spatial and genetic structure of male
   throat color morphs within a population of the tawny dragon lizard,
   Ctenophorus decresii. Male color morphs do not differ in morphology but
   differ in aggressive and antipredator behaviors as well as androgen
   levels. Despite these behavioral and endocrine differences, we find that
   color morphs do not differ in territory size, with their spatial
   arrangement being essentially random with respect to each other. There
   were no differences in genetic diversity or relatedness between morphs;
   however, there was significant, albeit weak, genetic differentiation
   between morphs, which was unrelated to geographic distance between
   individuals. Our results indicate potential weak barriers to gene flow
   between some morphs, potentially due to nonrandom pre- or postcopulatory
   mate choice or postzygotic genetic incompatibilities. However, space
   use, spatial structure, and nonrandom mating do not appear to be primary
   mechanisms maintaining color polymorphism in this system, highlighting
   the complexity and variation in alternative strategies associated with
   color polymorphism.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs; the heritable influence of one organism
   on a conspecific) can affect the evolutionary dynamics of complex
   traits, including behavior. Voluntary wheel running is an important
   model system in quantitative genetic studies of behavior, but the
   possibility of IGEs on wheel running and its components (time spent
   running and average running speed) has not been examined. Here, we
   analyze a dataset from a replicated selection experiment on wheel
   running (11,420 control and 26,575 selected mice measured over 78
   generations) in which the standard measurement protocol allowed for the
   possibility of IGEs occurring through odors because mice were provided
   with clean cages attached to a clean wheel or a wheel previously
   occupied by another mouse for 6days. Overall, mice ran less on
   previously occupied wheels than on clean wheels, and they ran
   significantly less when following a male than a female. Significant
   interactions indicated that the reduction in running was more pronounced
   for females than males and for mice from selected lines than control
   mice. Pedigree-based animal model analyses revealed significant IGEs for
   running distance (the trait under selection), with effect sizes
   considerably higher for the initial/exploratory phase (i.e., first two
   of six test days). Our results demonstrate that IGEs can occur in mice
   interacting through scent only, possibly because they attempt to avoid
   conspecifics.}},

Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Both reciprocity and positive assortment (like with like) are predicted
   to promote the evolution of cooperation, yet how partners influence each
   other's behaviour within dynamic networks is not well understood. One
   way to test this question is to partition phenotypic variation into
   differences among individuals in the expression of cooperative behaviour
   (the `direct effect'), and plasticity within individuals in response to
   the social environment (the `indirect effect'). A positive correlation
   between these two sources of variation, such that more cooperative
   individuals elicit others to cooperate, is predicted to facilitate
   social contagion and selection on cooperative behaviour. Testing this
   hypothesis is challenging, however, because it requires repeated
   measures of behaviour across a dynamic social landscape. Here, we use an
   automated data-logging system to quantify the behaviour of 179
   wire-tailed manakins, birds that form cooperative male-male coalitions,
   and we use multiple-membership models to test the hypothesis that
   dynamic network partnerships shape within-individual variation in
   cooperative behaviour. Our results show strong positive correlations
   between a bird's own sociality and his estimated effect on his partners,
   consistent with the hypothesis that cooperation begets cooperation.
   These findings support the hypothesis that social contagion can
   facilitate selection for cooperative behaviour within social networks.}},

   taxa, but we focus our review on mammalian species because of their
   close evolutionary proximity to humans and because of their relevance
   for understanding human health. Improving our understanding of how the

Abstract = {{When individuals interact, their phenotypes may be affected not only by
   their own genes but also by genes in their social partners. This
   phenomenon is known as Indirect Genetic Effects (IGEs). In aquaculture
   species and some plants, however, competition not only affects trait
   levels of individuals, but also inflates variability of trait values
   among individuals. In the field of quantitative genetics, the
   variability of trait values has been studied as a quantitative trait in
   itself, and is often referred to as inherited variability. Such studies,
   however, consider only the genetic effect of the focal individual on
   trait variability and do not make a connection to competition. Although
   the observed phenotypic relationship between competition and variability
   suggests an underlying genetic relationship, the current quantitative
   genetic models of IGE and inherited variability do not allow for such a
   relationship. The lack of quantitative genetic models that connect IGEs
   to inherited variability limits our understanding of the potential of
   variability to respond to selection, both in nature and agriculture.
   Models of trait levels, for example, show that IGEs may considerably
   change heritable variation in trait values. Currently, we lack the tools
   to investigate whether this result extends to variability of trait
   values. Here we present a model that integrates IGEs and inherited
   variability. In this model, the target phenotype, say growth rate, is a
   function of the genetic and environmental effects of the focal
   individual and of the difference in trait value between the social
   partner and the focal individual, multiplied by a regression
   coefficient. The regression coefficient is a genetic trait, which is a
   measure of cooperation; a negative value indicates competition, a
   positive value cooperation, and an increasing value due to selection
   indicates the evolution of cooperation. In contrast to the existing
   quantitative genetic models, our model allows for co-evolution of IGEs
   and variability, as the regression coefficient can respond to selection.
   Our simulations show that the model results in increased variability of
   body weight with increasing competition. When competition decreases,
   i.e., cooperation evolves, variability becomes significantly smaller.
   Hence, our model facilitates quantitative genetic studies on the
   relationship between IGEs and inherited variability. Moreover, our
   findings suggest that we may have been overlooking an entire level of
   genetic variation in variability, the one due to IGEs.}},

   evolutionary process, it remains largely unknown whether the strength of
   IGEs varies across life stages or competitive regimes. Based on
   manipulations of nymphal densities and > 3000 pair-wise aggression tests
   across multiple life stages, we experimentally demonstrate that IGEs on
   aggression are stronger in field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) that
   develop at lower densities than in those that develop at higher
   densities, and that these effects persist with age. The existence of
   density-dependent IGEs implies that social interactions strongly
   determine the plastic expression of aggression when competition for
   resources is relaxed. A more competitive (higher density) rearing
   environment may fail to provide crickets with sufficient resources to
   develop social cognition required for strong IGEs. The contribution of
   IGEs to evolutionary responses was greater at lower densities. Our study
   thereby demonstrates the importance of considering IGEs in
   density-dependent ecological and evolutionary processes.}},

Title = {{Parental care and sibling competition independently increase phenotypic

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},

Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2546-2552}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Several recent hypotheses suggest that parental care can influence the
   extent of phenotypic variation within populations; however, there have
   been few tests of these ideas. We exploited the facultative nature of
   posthatching parental care in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus
   vespilloides, to test whether parental care influences the expression of
   phenotypic variation in an important fitness trait (body size). We found
   that parental care and brood size (which influences sibling competition)
   had positive and independent effects on variation in body size. First,
   the mean coefficient of variation (CV) of body size was significantly
   greater in broods that received care than in those that did not. Second,
   CV body size increased with brood size in both parental care treatments.
   These results are not consistent with predictions from recent hypotheses
   that predict parental care will reduce phenotypic variation among
   siblings. The positive effects of parental care and brood size on
   phenotypic variation that we observed are likely due to sibling
   competition for access to provisioning parents and competition for
   limiting resources contained in the breeding carcass. Our results
   suggest that future theory linking parental care to the generation and
   maintenance of phenotypic variation must integrate the nature of
   interactions among family members.}},

Title = {{Born to Cry: A Genetic Dissection of Infant Vocalization}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Infant vocalizations are one of the most fundamental and innate forms of
   behavior throughout avian and mammalian orders. They have a critical
   role in motivating parental care and contribute significantly to fitness
   and reproductive success. Dysregulation of these vocalizations has been
   reported to predict risk of central nervous system pathologies such as
   hypoxia, meningitis, or autism spectrum disorder. Here, we have used the
   expanded BXD family of mice, and a diallel cross between DBA/2J and
   C57BL/6J parental strains, to begin the process of genetically
   dissecting the numerous facets of infant vocalizations. We calculate
   heritability, estimate the role of parent-of-origin effects, and
   identify novel quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control ultrasonic
   vocalizations (USVs) on postnatal days 7, 8, and 9; a stage that closely
   matches human infants at birth. Heritability estimates for the number
   and frequency of calls are low, suggesting that these traits are under
   high selective pressure. In contrast, duration and amplitude of calls
   have higher heritabilities, indicating lower selection, or their
   importance for kin recognition. We find suggestive evidence that
   amplitude of infant calls is dependent on the maternal genotype,
   independent of shared genetic variants. Finally, we identify two loci on
   Chrs 2 and 14 influencing call frequency, and a third locus on Chr 8
   influencing the amplitude of vocalizations. All three loci contain
   strong candidate genes that merit further analysis. Understanding the
   genetic control of infant vocalizations is not just important for
   understanding the evolution of parent-offspring interactions, but also
   in understanding the earliest innate behaviors, the development of
   parent-offspring relations, and the early identification of behavioral
   abnormalities.}},

Title = {{A guide to using a multiple-matrix animal model to disentangle genetic
   and nongenetic causes of phenotypic variance}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Non-genetic influences on phenotypic traits can affect our
   interpretation of genetic variance and the evolutionary potential of
   populations to respond to selection, with consequences for our ability
   to predict the outcomes of selection. Long-term population surveys and
   experiments have shown that quantitative genetic estimates are
   influenced by nongenetic effects, including shared environmental
   effects, epigenetic effects, and social interactions. Recent
   developments to the ``animal model{''} of quantitative genetics can now
   allow us to calculate precise individual-based measures of non-genetic
   phenotypic variance. These models can be applied to a much broader range
   of contexts and data types than used previously, with the potential to
   greatly expand our understanding of nongenetic effects on evolutionary
   potential. Here, we provide the first practical guide for researchers
   interested in distinguishing between genetic and nongenetic causes of
   phenotypic variation in the animal model. The methods use matrices
   describing individual similarity in nongenetic effects, analogous to the
   additive genetic relatedness matrix. In a simulation of various
   phenotypic traits, accounting for environmental, epigenetic, or cultural
   resemblance between individuals reduced estimates of additive genetic
   variance, changing the interpretation of evolutionary potential. These
   variances were estimable for both direct and parental nongenetic
   variances. Our tutorial outlines an easy way to account for these
   effects in both wild and experimental populations. These models have the
   potential to add to our understanding of the effects of genetic and
   nongenetic effects on evolutionary potential. This should be of interest
   both to those studying heritability, and those who wish to understand
   nongenetic variance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Behavioral traits of pigs have been shown to be partly under
   genetic control, which raises the possibility that behavior might be
   altered by genetic selection, resulting in pigs with better growth
   performance. Objective: To evaluate the behavior and growth of finishing
   pigs and investigate pigs selected for high or low social breeding value
   (SBV) in relation to social behavior and group growth. Methods:
   Thirty-five females and 35 boars from five positive and five negative
   SBV groups of finishing pigs were grown from 30 to 90 kg and housed in
   10 test pens (3.0 x 3.3 m, 7 pigs/pen). Pigs were recorded with video
   technology for nine consecutive hours on days 1, 15, and 30 after
   mixing. Pigs were weighed at approximately 90 kg body weight and the
   number of days to reach 90 kg was then calculated. Results: The
   frequency and duration of behaviors were present in the positive and
   negative SBV groups after mixing. On day 1 after mixing, agonistic
   behavior was significantly higher (p=0.027) for the -SBV group compared
   with the +SBV group. Feeding and feeding-together behaviors were
   significantly higher (p<0.003) in the +SBV group on days 1 and 30 after
   mixing. Moreover, growth performance to reach 90 kg body weight was
   significantly faster (p<0.002) in the +SBV group than in the -SBV group.
   Conclusion: Social interactions, such as feeding-together behavior,
   among pen mates might affect their growth rate and feed intake.
   Selection for SBV could be used as an indirect technique for improving
   growth performance of pigs.}},

Abstract = {{Community genetic (CG) effects and ecological factors create a complex
   set of interactions that are key drivers of evolutionary dynamics in
   ecological systems. To date, most studies investigating trait variation
   have focused on either effects of intraspecific genetic variation or on
   genotype by environment (GxE) interactions in isolation. Poorly
   investigated but very important are the interactions between CGs and
   indirect ecological effects (IEEs) that are caused by plant-soil
   interactions. Here, we tested how CGs in a cabbage host and its aphid
   parasite depended on the ecological conditions under which the host was
   grown. We established microcosms of different cabbage cultivars and
   aphid genotypes on soils inoculated with samples of other soils
   previously trained with onion. We hypothesized that such IEEs will have
   significantly different outcomes for ecosystems than predicted from
   simpler CG or GxE studies. Our analysis demonstrated a large IEE that
   differed by context and aphid genotype causing reduced parasite
   population sizes by up to 900. The IEE is induced by insect-repellent
   properties and the micro'time of the onion. Our results highlight the
   importance of interacting IEEs and CGs for ecosystems dynamics showing
   that IEEs offer sustainable solutions by dramatically reducing parasite
   burden on cash crops.}},

Abstract = {{In some ways, social spiders are a biological novelty item. They are not
   extraordinarily successful either evolutionarily or ecologically, and
   their societies suffer a variety of disadvantages that render them more
   brittle than other social systems. Yet, from an empiricist's
   perspective, these attributes make them uniquely poised for addressing a
   variety of research questions. Here we provide a brief overview of the
   biology of social spiders for the general reader. We then highlight a
   variety of ecological and evolutionary challenges suffered by these
   animals that renders them at risk of extinction in the short and long
   term. We finally discuss how these hardships have given rise to a
   variety of individual and group level adaptations that are rare or
   entirely absent in other spiders, as well as in most other social
   animals. Throughout this article, we highlight gaps in our current
   understanding of these creatures and draw attention to some of the more
   promising frontiers for future research. To this end, we have two goals.
   First, we would like to draw the attention of general behavioural
   ecologists interested in social evolution to the biology of social
   spiders, and emphasize a variety of reasons why one might consider these
   animals for their next research question. Second, for those already
   inculcated in the social spider literature, we hope that this article
   will raise the reader's consciousness to various underexplored but
   promising avenues for future research. With the right research question,
   social spiders promise to be a high-profile and high-throughput model
   system. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the

Abstract = {{How populations adapt, or not, to rapid evolution of sexual signals has
   important implications for population viability, but is difficult to
   assess due to the paucity of examples of sexual signals evolving in real
   time. In Hawaiian populations of the Pacific field cricket (Teleogryllus
   oceanicus), selection from a deadly parasitoid fly has driven the rapid
   loss of a male acoustic signal, calling song, that females use to locate
   and evaluate potential mates. In this newly quiet environment where many
   males are obligately silent, how do phonotactic females find mates?
   Previous work has shown that the acoustic rearing environment (presence
   or absence of male calling song) during late juvenile stages and early
   adulthood exposes adaptive flexibility in locomotor behaviors of males,
   as well as mating behaviors in both sexes that helps facilitate the
   spread of silent (flatwing) males. Here, we tested whether females also
   show acoustically induced plasticity in walking behaviors using
   laboratory-reared populations of T. oceanicus from Kauai (HI; >90\%
   flatwings), Oahu (HI; similar to 50\% flatwings), and Mangaia (Cook
   Islands; no flatwings or parasitoid fly). Though we predicted that
   females reared without song exposure would increase walking behaviors to
   facilitate mate localization when song is rare, we discovered that,
   unlike males, female T. oceanicus showed relatively little plasticity in
   exploratory behaviors in response to an acoustic rearing environment.
   Across all three populations, exposure to male calling song during
   development did not affect latency to begin walking, distance walked, or
   general activity of female crickets. However, females reared in the
   absence of song walked slower and showed a marginally non-significant
   tendency to walk for longer durations of time in a novel environment
   than those reared in the presence of song. Overall, plasticity in female
   walking behaviors appears unlikely to have facilitated sexual signal
   loss in this species.}},

Abstract = {{The knowledge of genetic trends and trade-offs between growth and
   reproductive traits might be useful to understand the evolution of these
   traits in livestock and natural populations of animals. We estimated the
   genetic trends and trade-offs between pre-weaning growth and calving
   intervals of Nellore animals from a commercial farm. Two-trait animal
   models were used to estimate covariance components and breeding values
   (EBV) for direct and maternal genetic effects of pre-weaning growth and
   direct genetic effects of calving intervals. Regression analyses were
   performed to examine the relationship between direct and maternal EBV of
   pre-weaning growth and direct EBV of calving intervals (dependent
   variables) and the coefficient of generation of each animal (independent
   variable). We also performed regression analyses to examine the
   relationship between direct EBV of calving intervals (dependent
   variables) and direct and maternal EBV of pre-weaning growth
   (independent variables). The genetic trends for direct and maternal
   genetic effect for pre-weaning growth were significant and presented
   genetic evolution in the studied Nellore herd. The genetic trends for
   the reproductive traits were also significant but indicated genetic
   changes in an unfavorable way. The genetic correlations between direct
   effects of pre-weaning growth and calving intervals traits and the
   genetic correlations between maternal effects of pre-weaning growth
   traits and direct effects of calving interval traits were not different
   from zero. The presence of trade-offs between the direct effects of
   growth and reproductive traits were confirmed through regression from
   direct EBV of calving intervals over EBV of pre-weaning growth traits.
   In addition, regression analyses showed that selection to increase
   pre-weaning growth also increased calving intervals. Our results showed
   that pre-weaning growth and calving intervals are increasing over
   generations and that trade-offs occurred between those traits in the
   studied Nellore herd.}},

Abstract = {{Social isolation has profound impacts. Most animal research focuses on
   negative phenotypic consequences of social isolation within individual
   lifetimes. Less is known about how it affects genetics, selection, and
   evolution over longer timescales, though ample indirect evidence
   suggests that it might. We advocate that evolutionary consequences of
   social isolation be tested more directly. We suggest that the `index of
   social isolation', the mismatch between actual and optimal social
   interaction experienced by individuals within a population, may play a
   key role in releasing cryptic genetic variation, adaptation rates,
   diversification patterns, and ecosystem-level processes. Evolutionary
   dynamics arising from social isolation could have significant impacts in
   applied settings such as conservation, animal breeding, control of
   biological invasions, and evolutionary resilience to anthropogenic
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Animals living in groups can show substantial variation in social traits
   and this affects their social organization. However, as the specific
   mechanisms driving this organization are difficult to identify in
   already organized groups typically found in the wild, the contribution
   of interindividual variation to group level behaviour remains enigmatic.
   Here, we present results of an experiment to create and compare groups
   that vary in social organization, and study how individual behaviour
   varies between these groups. We iteratively sorted individuals between
   groups of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, by ranking the groups according
   to their directional alignment and then mixing similar groups. Over the
   rounds of sorting the consistency of the group rankings increased,
   producing groups that varied significantly in key social behaviours such
   as collective activity and group cohesion. The repeatability of the
   underlying individual behaviour was then estimated by comparing the
   experimental data to simulations. At the level of basic locomotion,
   individuals in more coordinated groups displayed stronger interactions
   with the centre of the group, and weaker interactions with their nearest
   neighbours. We propose that this provides the basis for a passive
   phenotypic assortment mechanism that may explain the structures of
   social networks in the wild. (C) 2018 The Association for the Study of

Title = {{Linking the fine-scale social environment to mating decisions: a future

Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{Variation in extra-pair paternity (EPP) among individuals of the same
   population could result from stochastic demography or from individual
   differences in mating strategies. Although the adaptive value of EPP has
   been widely studied, much less is known about the characteristics of the
   social environment that drive the observed patterns of EPP. Here, we
   demonstrate how concepts and well-developed tools for the study of
   social behaviour (such as social network analysis) can enhance the study
   of extra-pair mating decisions (focussing in particular on avian mating
   systems). We present several hypotheses that describe how
   characteristics of the social environment in which individuals are
   embedded might influence the levels of EPP in a socially monogamous
   population. We use a multi-level social approach (Hinde, 1976) to
   achieve a detailed description of the social structure and social
   dynamics of individuals in a group. We propose that the pair-bond, the
   direct (local) social environment and the indirect (extended) social
   environment, can contribute in different ways to the variation observed
   in the patterns of EPP, at both the individual and the population level.
   A strength of this approach is that it integrates into the analysis
   (indirect) interactions with all potential mates in a population, thus
   extending the current framework to study extra-pair mating behaviour. We
   also encourage the application of social network methods such as
   temporal dynamic analysis to depict temporal changes in the patterns of
   interactions among individuals in a group, and to study how this affects
   mating behaviour. We argue that this new framework will contribute to a
   better understanding of the proximate mechanisms that drive variation in
   EPP within populations in socially monogamous species, and might
   ultimately provide insights into the evolution and maintenance of mating
   systems.}},

Title = {{The translation of animal welfare research into practice: The case of
   mixing aggression between pigs}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{204}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Aggression between unfamiliar pigs at mixing is a major animal welfare
   problem in commercial farming. It has been studied since the 1970s and
   remains an important topic in animal welfare research. Methods to reduce
   pig aggression at mixing have been reviewed previously, but there has
   been little translation of the advocated techniques and building designs
   into practice. As a result, the problem persists on many commercial
   units. A similar situation exists for many other animal welfare issues.
   This article takes a new approach in not only reviewing the recent
   scientific literature, but also reviewing the evidence of uptake in
   industry. Firstly, the current state of aggression mitigation research
   is reviewed; including the most successful recent developments in
   breeding against aggression, early life socialisation, the use of
   pheromones and nutrition. Secondly, information is extracted from both
   peer reviewed and industry literature to establish the extent to which
   these strategies have been transferred from research to practice.
   Finally, we discuss why in spite of the amount of research on reducing
   aggression at mixing the problem has not reduced in intensive farming
   systems. The limited uptake in practice appears to be due to low
   prioritisation of the problem, the practicalities of implementation,
   lack of information on cost-effectiveness and ineffective communication
   of research to the farming community. To bridge this gap, industry must
   be involved in the design of practical solutions and the
   cost-effectiveness of these must be quantified. This approach should
   also be considered for other animal welfare issues under investigation.
   We recommend a better alignment between research questions and industry
   interests to increase the success of research efforts to improve animal
   welfare in practice.}},

Journal = {{POPULATION ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{251-260}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Inbreeding and genetic drift can decrease genetic heterozygosity, and
   this low heterozygosity can depress fitness, resulting in
   heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs). HFCs are typically small in
   magnitude, a result often attributed to power of the analyses. Animal
   behaviors often affect fitness and are often heritable to some degree.
   We hypothesized that heterozygosity influences behavior, which, in turn,
   potentially influences fitness. Specifically, in red-backed salamanders,
   Plethodon cinereus, which have limited dispersal and the potential for
   inbreeding, we tested whether heterozygosity, as estimated from six
   microsatellite loci, affected home range size, juvenile growth, and
   survival. We found that salamanders with higher heterozygosity had
   larger home ranges and grew faster, which is indicative of reproductive
   success. However, we found no effects of heterozygosity on survival. We
   conclude that, because activity in P. cinereus is tightly linked to food
   uptake and mass gain, heterozygosity influences growth via effects on
   foraging behavior. Future research should investigate how the
   relationship between heterozygosity, behavior, and fitness may be
   affected or mediated by endocrine or immune systems.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection generally involves males evolving secondary sexual
   characters that satisfy the mating preferences of females. Behavioral
   ecologists have spent considerable research effort on identifying how
   variation in sexually-selected traits in insects is maintained among
   males at the expense of investigating the proximate and ultimate causes
   of variation in female mating preferences for those male traits. The
   past decade has witnessed improved effort in redressing this bias in
   insects with researchers identifying a host of factors intrinsic and
   extrinsic to the female as mediating flexibility in female mating
   behavior. Evidence is mounting that a female's social environment,
   whether experienced during development or as an adult, is key to shaping
   her mating preferences. Others have extended these observations to show
   that the genetic identity of the conspecific individuals comprising the
   social environment can have profound effects on female mating
   preferences via indirect genetic effects (IGEs), or through
   interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGEs) if the genotype of
   heterospecifics influences plasticity in mating preferences.
   Considerably more work is needed to not only expand our list of
   mediating intrinsic and extrinsic factors but also to identify how their
   interaction influences individual variation in male and female mating
   preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Theory on indirect genetic effects (IGEs) indicates that variation in
   the genetic composition of social groups can generate GxG epistasis that
   may promote the evolution of stable polymorphisms. Using a livebearing
   fish with a genetic polymorphism in coloration and associated behavioral
   differences, we tested whether genotypes of social partners interacted
   with focal individual genotypes to influence growth and condition over
   16 weeks of development. We found that IGEs had a significant influence
   on patterns of feeding, regardless of focal fish genotype. There was no
   influence of social environment on juvenile length, but there was
   significant GxG epistasis for body condition. Each focal juvenile was in
   better condition when its own genotype was not present in adult social
   partners. These data are consistent with negative frequency-dependent
   selection in which each morph performs better when it is rare. Neither
   variation in feeding nor activity-related behaviors explained variation
   in body condition, suggesting that GxG epistasis for condition was
   caused by physiological differences between the two genotypes. These
   findings indicate that GxG epistasis in a given polymorphism can
   generate fitness landscapes that contribute to the maintenance of that
   polymorphism and to maintenance of genetic variation for additional
   fitness-related traits.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{What was once expensive and revolutionary full-genome sequenceis now
   affordable and routine. Costs will continue to drop, opening up new
   frontiers in behavioral genetics. This shift in costs from the genome to
   the phenome is most notable in large clinical studies of behavior and
   associated diseases in cohorts that exceed hundreds of thousands of
   subjects. Examples include the Women's Health Initiative (www.whl.org),
   the Million Veterans Program (www.research.va.gov/MVP), the 100000
   Genomes Project (genomicsengland.co.uk) and commercial efforts such as
   those by deCode (www.decode.com) and 23 and me (www.23andme.com). The
   same transition is happening in experimental neuro- and behavioral
   genetics, and sample sizes of many hundreds of cases are becoming
   routine (www.genenetwork.org, www.mousephenotyping.org). There are two
   major consequences of this new affordability of massive omics datasets:
   (1) it is now far more practical to explore genetic modulation of
   behavioral differences and the key role of gene-by-environment
   interactions. Researchers are already doing the hard part the
   quantitative analysis of behavior. Adding the omics component can
   provide powerful links to molecules, cells, circuits and even better
   treatment. (2) There is an acute need to highlight and train behavioral
   scientists in how best to exploit new omics approaches. This review
   addresses this second issue and highlights several new trends and
   opportunities that will be of interest to experts in animal and human
   behaviors.}},

Title = {{Pervasive indirect genetic effects on behavioral development in
   polymorphic eastern mosquitofish}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{289-300}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{``Nurture{''} depends on the ``nature{''} of social partners. The
   behavior of a young male mosquitofish depends on genetic differences in
   his social partners and on his own genes. Social partners that are
   genetically dark or light colored affect the behavior differently. But,
   dark-colored males respond less to social differences than light males,
   and receive different behaviors from social partners. So, even
   apparently innate differences related to color can be caused by
   differences in the behavior of social partners.The social environment
   can dramatically influence the development and expression of individual
   behavior. Indirect genetic effects (IGE) arise when variation in the
   social environment depends on genotypic differences among social
   partners. Their role in generating variation and influencing
   evolutionary dynamics has become increasingly recognized in recent
   years, but less attention has been paid to how IGE arise during
   development. We measured the development of IGE using a discrete natural
   polymorphism in male coloration and associated behaviors in eastern
   mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). We observed substantial IGE and
   direct genetic effects on behavior. For some behaviors, IGE changed and
   even reversed direction over the 16 weeks of the experiment, indicating
   important developmental dynamics. Interaction between IGE and direct
   genetic effects for some behaviors suggests that melanistic males were
   less responsive to a genetic change in their social environment than
   nonmelanistic males were. Alternately, social partners might vary less
   in the behavior they direct toward melanistic males. Color morphs
   differed in mating behavior and in aggressive behavior they received
   from social partners, but not in direct measures of aggression.
   Therefore, even apparently innate differences in behavior between morphs
   could arise as indirect effects of differences in behavior directed
   toward them by social partners. These results indicate that some
   differences attributed to melanism in this and other species might
   result from color morphs experiencing different social environments.
   Deducing the developmental and social origins of these indirect effects
   is therefore critical for understanding melanism-associated behavioral
   variation in the many species in which it occurs.}},

Abstract = {{s Cannibalism is induced in larval-stage populations of the Hokkaido
   salamander, Hynobius retardatus, under the control of a cannibalism
   reaction norm. Here, I examined phenotypic expression under the
   cannibalism reaction norm, and how the induction of a cannibalistic
   morph under the norm leads to populational morphological
   diversification. I conducted a set of experiments in which density was
   manipulated to be either low or high. In the high-density treatment, the
   populations become dimorphic with some individuals developing into the
   cannibal morph type. I performed an exploratory analysis based on
   geometric morphometrics and showed that shape characteristics differed
   between not only cannibal and noncannibal morph types in the
   high-density treatment but also between those morph types and the
   solitary morph type in the low-density treatment. Size and shape of
   cannibal and noncannibal individuals were found to be located at either
   end of a continuum of expression following a unique size-shape
   integration rule that was different from the rule governing the size and
   shape variations of the solitary morph type. This result implies that
   the high-density-driven inducible morphology of an individual is
   governed by a common integration rule during the development of
   dimorphism under the control of the cannibalism reaction norm.
   Phenotypic expression under the cannibalism reaction norm is driven not
   only by population density but also by social interactions among the
   members of a population: variation in the populational expression of
   dimorphism is associated with contingent social interaction events among
   population members. The induced cannibalistic morph thus reflects not
   only by contest-type exploitative competition but also interference
   competition.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation in resident species can influence the assembly and
   dynamics of communities, but the potential for these genetic effects to
   persist across generations is largely unresolved. In principle,
   persistent, directional changes in communities are only predicted when
   community properties covary genetically with the fitness of resident
   species.
   Estimates of genetic covariance between the fitness of a resident
   species and its community are therefore necessary to ``close the
   eco-evolutionary loop{''} in studies of community genetics, but such
   estimates are rare. Emulating community genetics experiments in plants,
   we used clonal replicates of 21 genotypes of a resident species (the
   encrusting bryozoan, Hippopodina) to investigate the magnitude of
   genotypic variance contributing to assembly of a marine benthic
   community.
   Genotypes explained up to 35\% of variation in community assembly.
   Critically, the performance of Hippopodina genotypes covaried both with
   the evenness of communities and with the abundances of some individual
   species, representing an indirect genetic effect that creates the
   potential for multigenerational interactions between Hippopodina and
   co-existing species. Our results suggest that different genotypes will
   associate with different community members consistently across
   generations, and such non-random associations can give rise to
   specialization. Further interactions between species other than
   Hippopodina itself may also be altered by effects of genetic variation
   in the focal species.
   Furthermore, species in the community other than Hippopodina itself will
   interact more commonly in the presence of some genotypes over others.
   Our results support the potential for genetic variation in one species
   to have deterministic effects on the dynamics of ecological communities.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms express phenotypic plasticity during social interactions.
   Interacting phenotype theory has explored the consequences of social
   plasticity for evolution, but it is unclear how this theory applies to
   complex social structures. We adapt interacting phenotype models to
   general social structures to explore how the number of social
   connections between individuals and preference for phenotypically
   similar social partners affect phenotypic variation and evolution. We
   derive an analytical model that ignores phenotypic feedback and use
   simulations to test the predictions of this model. We find that adapting
   previous models to more general social structures does not alter their
   general conclusions but generates insights into the effect of social
   plasticity and social structure on the maintenance of phenotypic
   variation and evolution. Contribution of indirect genetic effects to
   phenotypic variance is highest when interactions occur at intermediate
   densities and decrease at higher densities, when individuals approach
   interacting with all group members, homogenizing the social environment
   across individuals. However, evolutionary response to selection tends to
   increase at greater network densities as the effects of an individual's
   genes are amplified through increasing effects on other group members.
   Preferential associations among similar individuals (homophily) increase
   both phenotypic variance within groups and evolutionary response to
   selection. Our results represent a first step in relating social network
   structure to the expression of social plasticity and evolutionary
   responses to selection.}},

Title = {{Heterospecific Nest Site Copying Behavior in a Wild Bird: Assessing the
   Influence of Genetics and Past Experience on a Joint Breeding Phenotype}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Breeding site selection is often a joint decision of pair members in
   species with biparental care and the experience of both pair members may
   influence the use of information for site selection. Nevertheless,
   quantitative genetics of joint information use for site selection
   remains unexplored so far. We used an experimental approach to quantify
   the relative importance of genetics (heritability) and past experience
   (age, familiarity with the environment, previous breeding success,
   previous information use) in heterospecific social information use for
   nest site selection in wild collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis).
   Flycatchers collect social information from resident tits for nest site
   selection. We created an apparent preference of tits for a novel nest
   site feature and recorded choices of flycatchers (copying or rejecting
   the tit preference). Copying behavior was stronger for naive individuals
   but also differed between years, which could be explained by contrasting
   seasonality in the demonstrator species. Past experience as reflected by
   age affected subsequent use of social information: pairs with a yearling
   male were more likely to copy the heterospecific preference than pairs
   with older immigrant males. There was no general pattern in successive
   individual choices over the years. Accordingly, individual repeatability
   in copying tit preference was very low. At the pair level, we estimated
   sex-specific direct and indirect genetic effects on the joint nest site
   decision and found no sex-specific heritability and no cross-sex genetic
   correlation. Our results confirm the importance of past experience for
   social information use and suggest that social information use is highly
   plastic and most likely not genetically inherited in collared
   flycatchers. Whether individuals use social information should be
   related to environmentally-induced changes in the quality of information
   and thus be context-dependent. Selection may therefore act on the
   ability to optimally use social information in varying environments and
   on the processes underlying such adjustment, such as learning, rather
   than the use of information itself.}},

   Whether this sorting of like with like arises from historical patterns

   play an important role in the creation of homophilous relationships. We
   extend this work by using data from 5,500 adolescents from the National

   evidence that friends have correlated genotypes, both at the
   whole-genome level as well as at trait-associated loci (via polygenic
   scores), further analysis suggests that meso-level forces, such as
   school assignment, are a principal source of genetic similarity between
   friends. We also observe apparent socialgenetic effects in which
   polygenic scores of an individual's friends and schoolmates predict the
   individual's own educational attainment. In contrast, an individual's
   height is unassociated with the height genetics of peers.}},

Pages = {{1-11}},

Abstract = {{Behavior is rapidly flexible and highly context-dependent, which poses
   obvious challenges to researchers attempting to dissect its causes.
   However, over a century of unresolved debate has also focused on whether
   the very flexibility and context-dependence of behavior lends it a
   unique role in the evolutionary origins and patterns of diversity in the
   Animal Kingdom. Here, we propose that both challenges can benefit from
   studying how indirect genetic effects (IGEs: the effects of genes
   expressed in one individual on traits in another individual) shape
   behavioral phenotypes. We provide a sketch of the theoretical framework
   that grounds IGEs in behavioral ecology research and focus on recent
   advances made from studies of IGEs in areas of behavioral ecology such
   as sexual selection, sexual conflict, social dominance, and
   parent-offspring interactions. There is mounting evidence that IGEs have
   important influences on behavioral phenotypes associated with these
   processes, such as sexual signals and preferences and behaviors which
   function to manipulate interacting partners. IGEs can also influence
   both responses to selection and selection itself, and considering IGEs
   refines evolutionary predictions and provides new perspectives on the
   origins of seemingly perplexing behavioral traits. A key unresolved
   question, but one that has dominated the behavioral sciences for over a
   century, is whether behavior is more likely than other types of traits
   to contribute to evolutionary change and diversification. We advocate
   taking advantage of an IGE approach to outline falsifiable hypotheses
   and a general methodology to rigorously test this frequently proposed,
   yet still contentious, special role of behavior in evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Competition for resources including food, physical space, and potential
   mates is a fundamental ecological process shaping variation in
   individual phenotype and fitness. The evolution of competitive ability,
   in particular social dominance, depends on genetic (co)variation among
   traits causal (e.g., behavior) or consequent (e.g., growth) to
   competitive outcomes. If dominance is heritable, it will generate both
   direct and indirect genetic effects (IGE) on resource-dependent traits.
   The latter are expected to impose evolutionary constraint because
   winners necessarily gain resources at the expense of losers. We varied
   competition in a population of sheepshead swordtails, Xiphophorus
   birchmanni, to investigate effects on behavior, size, growth, and
   survival. We then applied quantitative genetic analyses to determine (i)
   whether competition leads to phenotypic and/or genetic integration of
   behavior with life history and (ii) the potential for IGE to constrain
   life history evolution. Size, growth, and survival were reduced at high
   competition. Male dominance was repeatable and dominant individuals show
   higher growth and survival. Additive genetic contributions to phenotypic
   covariance were significant, with the G matrix largely recapitulating
   phenotypic relationships. Social dominance has a low but significant
   heritability and is strongly genetically correlated with size and
   growth. Assuming causal dependence of growth on dominance, hidden IGE
   will therefore reduce evolutionary potential.}},

Title = {{The Paradox of Intelligence: Heritability and Malleability Coexist in
   Hidden Gene-Environment Interplay}},

Abstract = {{Intelligence can have an extremely high heritability, but also be
   malleable; a paradox that has been the source of continuous controversy.
   Here we attempt to clarify the issue, and advance a frequently
   overlooked solution to the paradox: Intelligence is a trait with unusual
   properties that create a large reservoir of hidden gene-environment (GE)
   networks, allowing for the contribution of high genetic and
   environmental influences on individual differences in IQ. GE interplay
   is difficult to specify with current methods, and is underestimated in
   standard metrics of heritability (thus inflating estimates of
   ``genetic{''} effects). We describe empirical evidence for GE interplay
   in intelligence, with malleability existing on top of heritability. The
   evidence covers cognitive gains consequent to adoption/immigration,
   changes in IQ's heritability across life span and socioeconomic status,
   gains in IQ over time consequent to societal development (the Flynn
   effect), the slowdown of age-related cognitive decline, and the gains in
   intelligence from early education. The GE solution has novel
   implications for enduring problems, including our inability to identify
   intelligence-related genes (also known as IQ's ``missing
   heritability{''}), and the loss of initial benefits from early
   intervention programs (such as ``Head Start{''}). The GE solution can be
   a powerful guide to future research, and may also aid policies to
   overcome barriers to the development of intelligence, particularly in
   impoverished and underprivileged populations.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{236-243}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{There is growing evidence for consistent among-individual variation in
   individual sociability (e.g., tendency to be sociable) in a number of
   species. However, sexes often differ in their social behaviors, as well
   as the selection pressures which they experience. This may translate
   into differences in repeatability of sociability, although this has not
   yet been tested. Here, we investigated whether eastern water dragons
   (Intellegama leseurii) exhibited evidence of consistent among-individual
   variation (i.e., repeatability) in 4 different measurements of
   sociability. Specifically, we measured sociability in 4 ways (degree,
   centrality, proportion of time spent being social, and number of
   preferences), and tested whether there was evidence for sex differences
   in the repeatability of these sociability measurements, or whether
   observed levels of repeatability could be explained by a stable social
   environment. Our findings provide new evidence for sex differences in
   social personality: we found that males were significantly repeatable in
   3 of 4 sociability measurements (degree, centrality, and proportion of
   time spent being social), whereas females were not. Further, we found
   that these differences were not a result of differences in the dynamics
   of the social environment. We discuss our findings in the context of
   sexual selection, as well as sex differences in the evolutionary drivers
   of social behavior.}},

Title = {{Quantitative Genetic Modeling of the Parental Care Hypothesis for the
   Evolution of Endothermy}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{There are two heuristic explanations proposed for the evolution of
   endothermy in vertebrates: a correlated response to selection for stable
   body temperatures, or as a correlated response to increased activity.
   Parental care has been suggested as a major driving force in this
   context given its impact on the parents' activity levels and energy
   budgets, and in the offspring's growth rates due to food provisioning
   and controlled incubation temperature. This results in a complex
   scenario involving multiple traits and transgenerational fitness
   benefits that can be hard to disentangle, quantify and ultimately test.
   Here we demonstrate how standard quantitative genetic models of maternal
   effects can be applied to study the evolution of endothermy, focusing on
   the interplay between daily energy expenditure (DEE) of the mother and
   growth rates of the offspring. Our model shows that maternal effects can
   dramatically exacerbate evolutionary responses to selection in
   comparison to regular univariate models (breeder's equation). This
   effect would emerge from indirect selection mediated by maternal effects
   concomitantly with a positive genetic covariance between DEE and growth
   rates. The multivariate nature of selection, which could favor a higher
   DEE, higher growth rates or both, might partly explain how high turnover
   rates were continuously favored in a self-reinforcing process. Overall,
   our quantitative genetic analysis provides support for the parental care
   hypothesis for the evolution of endothermy. We contend that much has to
   be gained from quantifying maternal and developmental effects on
   metabolic and thermoregulatory variation during adulthood.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment is both an important agent of selection for most
   organisms, and an emergent property of their interactions. As an
   aggregation of interactions among members of a population, the social
   environment is a product of many sets of relationships and so can be
   represented as a network or matrix. Social network analysis in animals
   has focused on why these networks possess the structure they do, and
   whether individuals' network traits, representing some aspect of their
   social phenotype, relate to their fitness. Meanwhile, quantitative
   geneticists have demonstrated that traits expressed in a social context
   can depend on the phenotypes and genotypes of interacting partners,
   leading to influences of the social environment on the traits and
   fitness of individuals and the evolutionary trajectories of populations.
   Therefore, both fields are investigating similar topics, yet have
   arrived at these points relatively independently. We review how these
   approaches are diverged, and yet how they retain clear parallelism and
   so strong potential for complementarity. This demonstrates that, despite
   separate bodies of theory, advances in one might inform the other.
   Techniques in network analysis for quantifying social phenotypes, and
   for identifying community structure, should be useful for those studying
   the relationship between individual behaviour and group-level
   phenotypes. Entering social association matrices into quantitative
   genetic models may also reduce bias in heritability estimates, and allow
   the estimation of the influence of social connectedness on trait
   expression. Current methods for measuring natural selection in a social
   context explicitly account for the fact that a trait is not necessarily
   the property of a single individual, something the network approaches
   have not yet considered when relating network metrics to individual
   fitness. Harnessing evolutionary models that consider traits affected by
   genes in other individuals (i.e. indirect genetic effects) provides the
   potential to understand how entire networks of social interactions in
   populations influence phenotypes and predict how these traits may
   evolve. By theoretical integration of social network analysis and
   quantitative genetics, we hope to identify areas of compatibility and
   incompatibility and to direct research efforts towards the most
   promising areas. Continuing this synthesis could provide important
   insights into the evolution of traits expressed in a social context and
   the evolutionary consequences of complex and nuanced social phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding of trait evolution is built upon studies that examine
   the correlation between traits and fitness, most of which implicitly
   assume all individuals experience similar selective environments.
   However, accounting for differences in selective pressures, such as
   variation in the social environment, can advance our understanding of
   how selection shapes individual traits and subsequent fitness. In this
   study, we test whether variation in the social environment affects
   selection on individual phenotype. We apply a new sexual network
   framework to quantify each male's social environment as the mean body
   size of his primary competitors. We test for direct and social selection
   on male body size using a 10-year data set on black-throated blue
   warblers (Setophaga caerulescens), a territorial species for which body
   size is hypothesized to mediate competition for mates. We found that
   direct selection on body size was weak and nonsignificant, as was social
   selection via the body size of the males' competitors. Analysing both
   types of selection simultaneously allows us to firmly reject a role for
   body size in competitive interactions between males and subsequent male
   fitness in this population. We evaluate the application of the sexual
   network approach to empirical data and suggest that other phenotypic
   traits such as song characteristics and plumage may be more relevant
   than body size for male-male competition in this small passerine bird.}},

Abstract = {{Assortative mating in wild populations is commonly reported as the
   correlation between males' and females' phenotypes across mated pairs.
   Theories of partner selection and quantitative genetics assume that
   phenotypic resemblance of partners captures associations in
   intrinsically determined trait values. However, when considering traits
   with a repeatability below one (labile traits or traits measured with
   error), the correlation between phenotypes of paired individuals can
   arise from shared environmental effects on the phenotypes of paired
   individuals or correlated measurement error. We introduce statistical
   approaches to estimate assortative mating in labile traits or traits
   measured with error in the presence of shared environmental effects.
   These approaches include (1) the correlation between the mean phenotypes
   of males and females, (2) the correlation between randomized values of
   individuals and (3) the between-pair correlation derived from a
   bivariate mixed model. We use simulations to show that the performance
   of these different approaches depends on the number of repeated measures
   within individuals or pairs, which is determined by study design, and
   rates of survival and divorce. We conclude that short-term environmental
   effects on phenotypes of paired individuals likely inflate estimates of
   assortative mating when not statistically accounted for. Our approach
   allows investigation of this important issue in assortative mating
   studies for labile traits (e.g. behaviour, physiology, or metabolism) in
   both socially monogamous and other mating systems, and groupings of
   individuals outside a mating context.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{11-20}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Interactions with conspecifics are an important aspect of an
   individual's environment. Although it is well known that the presence of
   conspecifics can have important effects on behaviour, in general it is
   also now acknowledged that the composition of the social environment can
   vary, and that this variation may have profound effects on individual
   behaviour and fitness. Using a wild population of North American red
   squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, we investigated the importance of
   the composition of the social environment in a territorial species by
   assessing whether the risk of intrusion faced by territory owners varied
   with the degree of relatedness and familiarity in their social
   neighbourhoods. To test this, we conducted temporary removals of
   territory owners and observed the time until intrusion and the identity
   of intruding individuals. We found that individuals in neighbourhoods
   with low average familiarity faced a higher risk of intrusion and that
   unfamiliar neighbours were more likely to intrude. Surprisingly, we
   found that related neighbours also posed a higher risk of intrusion. The
   results from our study suggest that familiarity with neighbours may be
   an ecologically and evolutionarily relevant measure of the social
   environment, even in a species considered to be `asocial'. Future
   studies should consider the potential importance of the social
   environment, which has heretofore been mostly overlooked, as a relevant
   selective pressure in asocial, territorial species. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{A central problem in evolutionary biology is to determine whether and
   how social interactions contribute to natural selection. A key method
   for phenotypic data is social selection analysis, in which fitness
   effects from social partners contribute to selection only when there is
   a correlation between the traits of individuals and their social
   partners (nonrandom phenotypic assortment). However, there are
   inconsistencies in the use of social selection that center around the
   measurement of phenotypic assortment. Here, we use data analysis and
   simulations to resolve these inconsistencies, showing that: (i) not all
   measures of assortment are suitable for social selection analysis; and
   (ii) the interpretation of assortment, and how to detect nonrandom
   assortment, will depend on the scale at which it is measured. We discuss
   links to kin selection theory and provide a practical guide for the
   social selection approach.}},

Abstract = {{Family members show behavioural strategies predicted to maximize
   individual fitness. These behaviours depend directly on genes expressed
   in focal individuals but also indirectly on genes expressed in other
   family members. However, how sibling and parental behavioural strategies
   are modified by genes expressed in family members, and to what degree,
   remains unclear. To answer this question, we have used a split litter
   design in an experimental population of genetically variable mouse
   families, and identified loci that indirectly affected sibling and
   maternal behaviour simultaneously. These loci map to genomic regions
   that also show a direct effect on offspring behaviour. Directly and
   indirectly affected traits were significantly correlated at the
   phenotypic level, illustrating how indirect effects are caused. Genetic
   variants in offspring that influence solicitation also impacted their
   siblings' and maternal behaviour. However, in contrast to predictions
   from sibling competition, unrelated litter mates benefited from
   increased solicitation. Overall, such indirect genetic effects explained
   a large proportion of variation seen in behaviours, with candidate genes
   involved in metabolism to neuronal development. These results reveal
   that we need to view behavioural strategies as the result of conjoint
   selection on genetic variation in all interacting family members.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptic evolution occurs when evolutionary change is masked by
   concurrent environmental change. In most cases, evolutionary changes in
   the phenotype are masked by changing abiotic factors. However,
   evolutionary change in one trait might also be masked by evolutionary
   change in another trait, a phenomenon referred to as evolutionary
   environmental deterioration. Nevertheless, detecting this second type of
   cryptic evolution is challenging and there are few compelling examples.
   Here, we describe a likely case of evolutionary environmental
   deterioration occurring in experimental burying beetle (Nicrophorus
   vespilloides) populations that are adapting to a novel social
   environment that lacks post-hatching parental care. We found that
   populations rapidly adapted to the removal of post-hatching parental
   care. This adaptation involved clear increases in breeding success and
   larval density (number of dispersing larvae produced per gram of
   breeding carcass), which in turn masked a concurrent increase in the
   mean larval mass across generations. This cryptic increase in larval
   mass was accomplished through a change in the reaction norm that relates
   mean larval mass to larval density. Our results suggest that cryptic
   evolution might be commonplace in animal families, because evolving
   trophic and social interactions can potentially mask evolutionary change
   in other traits, like body size.}},

Abstract = {{Based on the thoughtful and thought-provoking comments, we strengthened
   some of the main proposals of our framework to integrate research on
   personality structure, process, and development. Integration is an
   important, yet challenging goal for personality science, and we see
   considerable potential for it, theoretically and in empirical research.
   We clarified our use of critical concepts, such as behaviour, trait, and
   personality structure. We suggest that avoiding use of broadly construed
   traits will be helpful in preventing circularity in explanations.
   Strictly speaking, we see no causal role for broadly construed traits.
   We discuss how observed structural differences between measures taken
   over different time scales or within and between individuals, can inform
   hypotheses about shared and unique causal mechanisms, and argue for the
   unique relevance of psychological processes in personality science.

Abstract = {{One of the triumphs of evolutionary biology is the discovery of robust
   mechanisms that promote the evolution of cooperative behaviors even when
   cooperation reduces the fertility or survival of cooperators. These
   mechanisms include, kin selection, reciprocity, and direct benefits to
   cooperation that are often nonlinear. Though they have been extensively
   studied separately, investigating the joint action of these mechanisms
   has been more difficult. Moreover, how these mechanisms shape variation
   in cooperation is not well known. Such variation is crucial for
   understanding the evolution of behavioral syndromes and animal
   personality. Here, I use the tools of kin selection and evolutionary
   game theory to build a framework that integrates these mechanisms for
   pairwise social interactions. Using relatedness as a measure of the
   strength of kin selection, responsiveness as a measure of reciprocity,
   and synergy as a measure of payoff nonlinearity, I show how different
   combinations of these three parameters produce directional selection for
   or against cooperation or variation in levels of cooperation via
   stabilizing or diversifying selection. Moreover, each of these outcomes
   maps uniquely to one of four classic games from evolutionary game
   theory, which means that modulating relatedness, responsiveness, and
   synergy effectively transforms the payoff matrix from one the
   evolutionary game to another. Assuming that cooperation exacts a
   fertility cost on cooperators and provides a fertility benefit to social
   partners, a prisoner's dilemma game and directional selection against
   cooperation occur when relatedness and responsiveness are low and
   synergy is not too positive. Enough positive synergy in these conditions
   generates a stag-hunt game and diversifying selection. High levels of
   relatedness or responsiveness turn cooperation from a fitness cost into
   a fitness benefit, which produces a mutualism game and directional
   selection for cooperation when synergy is not too negative. Sufficiently
   negative synergy in this case creates a hawk-dove game and stabilizing
   selection for cooperation. I extend the results with relatedness and
   synergy to social groups and show that how group size changes the effect
   of relatedness and synergy on selection for cooperation depends on how
   the per capita benefit of cooperation changes with group size. Together,
   these results provide a general framework with which to generate
   comparative predictions that can be tested using quantitative genetic
   techniques and experimental techniques that manipulate investment in
   cooperation. These predictions will help us understand both
   interspecific variation in cooperation as well as within-population and
   within-group variation in cooperation related to behavioral syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{Despite essential progress towards understanding the evolution of
   cooperative behaviour, we still lack detailed knowledge about its
   underlying molecular mechanisms, genetic basis, evolutionary dynamics
   and ontogeny. An international workshop ``Genetics and Development of
   Cooperation,{''} organized by the University of Bern (Switzerland),
   aimed at discussing the current progress in this research field and
   suggesting avenues for future research. This review uses the major
   themes of the meeting as a springboard to synthesize the concepts of
   genetic and nongenetic inheritance of cooperation, and to review a
   quantitative genetic framework that allows for the inclusion of indirect
   genetic effects. Furthermore, we argue that including nongenetic
   inheritance, such as transgenerational epigenetic effects, parental
   effects, ecological and cultural inheritance, provides a more nuanced
   view of the evolution of cooperation. We summarize those genes and
   molecular pathways in a range of species that seem promising candidates
   for mechanisms underlying cooperative behaviours. Concerning the
   neurobiological substrate of cooperation, we suggest three cognitive
   skills necessary for the ability to cooperate: (i) event memory, (ii)
   synchrony with others and (iii) responsiveness to others. Taking a
   closer look at the developmental trajectories that lead to the
   expression of cooperative behaviours, we discuss the dichotomy between
   early morphological specialization in social insects and more flexible
   behavioural specialization in cooperatively breeding vertebrates.
   Finally, we provide recommendations for which biological systems and
   species may be particularly suitable, which specific traits and
   parameters should be measured, what type of approaches should be
   followed, and which methods should be employed in studies of cooperation
   to better understand how cooperation evolves and manifests in nature.}},

Abstract = {{An individual's genes may influence the phenotype of neighboring
   conspecifics. Such indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are important as they
   can affect the apparent total heritable variance in a population, and
   thus the response to selection. We studied these effects in a large,
   pedigreed population of Eucalyptus globulus using variance component
   analyses of Mycosphearella leaf disease, diameter growth at age 2 years,
   and post-infection diameter growth at ages 4 and 8 years. In a novel
   approach, we initially modeled IGEs using a factor analytic (FA)
   structure to identify the most influential neighbor positions, with the
   FA loadings being position-specific regressions on the IGEs. This
   involved sequentially comparing FA models for the variance-covariance
   matrices of the direct and indirect effects of each neighbor. We then
   modeled IGEs as a distance-based, combined effect of the most
   influential neighbors. This often increased the magnitude and
   significance of indirect genetic variance estimates relative to using
   all neighbors. The extension of a univariate IGEs model to bivariate
   analyses also provided insights into the genetic architecture of this
   population, revealing that: (1) IGEs arising from increased probability
   of neighbor infection were not associated with reduced growth of
   neighbors, despite adverse fitness effects being evident at the direct
   genetic level; and (2) the strong, genetic-based competitive
   interactions for growth, established early in stand development, were
   highly positively correlated over time. Our results highlight the
   complexities of genetic-based interactions at the multi-trait level due
   to (co) variances associated with IGEs, and the marked discrepancy
   occurring between direct and total heritable variances.}},

   behaviour}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural ecology research increasingly focuses on why genetic
   behavioural variation can persist despite selection. Evolutionary theory
   predicts that directional selection leads to evolutionary change while
   depleting standing genetic variation. Nevertheless, evolutionary stasis
   may occur for traits involved in social interactions. This requires
   tight negative genetic correlations between direct genetic effects
   (DGEs) of an individual's genes on its own phenotype and the indirect
   genetic effects (IGEs) it has on conspecifics, as this could diminish
   the amount of genetic variation available to selection to act upon. We
   tested this prediction using a pedigreed laboratory population of
   Mediterranean field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus), in which both
   exploratory tendency and aggression are heritable. We found that
   genotypes predisposed to be aggressive (due to DGEs) strongly decreased
   aggressiveness in opponents (due to IGEs). As a consequence, the
   variance in total breeding values was reduced to almost zero, implying
   that IGEs indeed greatly contribute to the occurrence of evolutionary
   stasis. IGEs were further associated with genetic variation in a
   non-social behaviour: explorative genotypes elicited most aggression in
   opponents. These key findings imply that IGEs indeed represent an
   important overlooked mechanism that can impact evolutionary dynamics of
   traits under selection.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on the evolution of cooperative behaviour are typically confined
   to understanding its adaptive value. It is equally essential, however,
   to understand its potential to evolve, requiring knowledge about the
   phenotypic consistency and genetic basis of cooperative behaviour. While
   previous observational studies reported considerably high heritabilities
   of helping behaviour in cooperatively breeding vertebrates, experimental
   studies disentangling the relevant genetic and non-genetic components of
   cooperative behaviour are lacking. In a half-sibling breeding
   experiment, we investigated the repeatability and heritability of three
   major helping behaviours performed by subordinates of the cooperatively
   breeding fish Neolamprologus pulcher. To experimentally manipulate the
   amount of help needed in a territory, we raised the fish in two
   environments differing in egg predation risk. All three helping
   behaviours were significantly repeatable, but had very low
   heritabilities. The high within-individual consistencies were
   predominantly due to maternal and permanent environment effects. The
   perceived egg predation risk had no effect on helping, but social
   interactions significantly influenced helping propensities. Our results
   reveal that developmentally plastic adjustments of provided help to
   social context shape cooperative phenotypes, whereas heritable genetic
   variation plays a minor role.}},

Abstract = {{Classical models of evolution seldom predict the rate at which
   populations evolve in the wild. One explanation is that the social
   environment affects how traits change in response to natural selection.
   Here we determine how social interactions between parents and offspring,
   and among lareae, influence the response to experimental selection on
   adult size. Our experiments focus on burying beetles (Nicrophorus
   vespilloides), whose larvae develop within a carrion nest. Some broods
   exclusively self-feed on the carrion, while others are also fed by their
   parents. We found that populations responded to selection for larger
   adults, but only when parents cared for their offspring. We also found
   that populations responded to selection for smaller adults, but only by
   removing parents and causing larvae interactions to exert more influence
   on eventual adult size. Comparative analyses revealed a similar pattern:
   evolutionary increases in species size within the genus Nicrophorus are
   associated with the obligate provision of care. Combining our results
   with previous studies, we suggest that cooperative social environments
   enhance the response to selection, whereas excessive conflict can
   prevent a response to further directional selection.}},

Abstract = {{Despite strong purifying or directional selection, variation is
   ubiquitous in populations. One mechanism for the maintenance of
   variation is indirect genetic effects (IGEs), as the fitness of a given
   genotype will depend somewhat on the genes of its social partners. IGEs
   describe the effect of genes in social partners on the expression of the
   phenotype of a focal individual. Here, we ask what effect IGEs, and
   variation in IGEs between abiotic environments, has on locomotion in
   Drosophila. This trait is known to be subject to intralocus sexually
   antagonistic selection. We estimate the coefficient of interaction, ,
   using six inbred lines of Drosophila. We found that varied between
   abiotic environments, and that it may vary across among male genotypes
   in an abiotic environment specific manner. We also found evidence that
   social effects of males alter the value of a sexually dimorphic trait in
   females, highlighting an interesting avenue for future research into
   sexual antagonism. We conclude that IGEs are an important component of
   social and sexual interactions and that they vary between individuals
   and abiotic environments in complex ways, with the potential to promote
   the maintenance of phenotypic variation.}},

Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{Genotype by genotype indirect genetic effects (G x G IGEs) occur when
   the phenotype of an individual is influenced by an interaction between
   its own genotype and those of neighbour individuals. Little is known
   regarding the relative importance of G x G IGEs compared with other
   forms of direct and indirect genetic effects. We quantified the relative
   importance of IGEs in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, a
   species in which IGEs are likely to be important as air-borne social
   interactions are known to affect growth. We used a collection of
   distantly related wild isolates, lab strains and a set of closely
   related mutation accumulation lines to estimate the contribution of
   direct and indirect genetic effects on mycelium growth rate, a key
   fitness component. We found that indirect genetic effects were dominated
   by Gx G IGEs that occurred primarily between a focal genotype and its
   immediate neighbour within a vertical stack, and these accounted for
   11\% of phenotypic variation. These results indicate that G x G IGEs may
   be substantial, at least in some systems, and that the evolutionary
   importance of these interactions may be underappreciated, especially in
   microbes. We advocate for a wider use of the IGE framework in both
   applied (for example, choice of varietal mixtures in plant breeding) and
   evolutionary genetics (kin selection/kin competition studies).}},

Abstract = {{Forest tree hybrid zones provide a wealth of novel genetic variation

   hybrid zones play in managing conservation of genetic variation, the

Title = {{A model to estimate effects of SNPs on host susceptibility and
   infectivity for an endemic infectious disease}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{49}},
Month = {{JUN 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Infectious diseases in farm animals affect animal health,
   decrease animal welfare and can affect human health. Selection and
   breeding of host individuals with desirable traits regarding infectious
   diseases can help to fight disease transmission, which is affected by
   two types of (genetic) traits: host susceptibility and host infectivity.
   Quantitative genetic studies on infectious diseases generally connect an
   individual's disease status to its own genotype, and therefore capture
   genetic effects on susceptibility only. However, they usually ignore
   variation in exposure to infectious herd mates, which may limit the
   accuracy of estimates of genetic effects on susceptibility. Moreover,
   genetic effects on infectivity will exist as well. Thus, to design
   optimal breeding strategies, it is essential that genetic effects on
   infectivity are quantified. Given the potential importance of genetic
   effects on infectivity, we set out to develop a model to estimate the
   effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on both host
   susceptibility and host infectivity. To evaluate the quality of the
   resulting SNP effect estimates, we simulated an endemic disease in 10
   groups of 100 individuals, and recorded time-series data on individual
   disease status. We quantified bias and precision of the estimates for
   different sizes of SNP effects, and identified the optimum recording
   interval when the number of records is limited.
   Results: We present a generalized linear mixed model to estimate the
   effect of SNPs on both host susceptibility and host infectivity. SNP
   effects were on average slightly underestimated, i. e. estimates were
   conservative. Estimates were less precise for infectivity than for
   susceptibility. Given our sample size, the power to estimate SNP effects
   for susceptibility was 100\% for differences between genotypes of a
   factor 1.56 or more, and was higher than 60\% for infectivity for
   differences between genotypes of a factor 4 or more. When disease status
   was recorded 11 times on each animal, the optimal recording interval was
   25 to 50\% of the average infectious period.
   Conclusions: Our model was able to estimate genetic effects on
   susceptibility and infectivity. In future genomewide association
   studies, it may serve as a starting point to identify genes that affect
   disease transmission and disease prevalence.}},

Title = {{Interpreting selection when individuals interact}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. A useful interpretation of quantitative genetic models of
   evolutionary change is that they (i) define a set of phenotypes that
   have a causal effect on fitness and on which selection acts, and (ii)
   define a set of breeding values that change as a correlated response to
   that selection because they covary with the phenotypes.
   2. When the expression of one trait causes variation in other traits
   then there are multiple paths by which a trait can cause fitness
   variation. Because of this, there are multiple ways in which selection
   can be defined, and still be consistent with a causal effect of traits
   on fitness.
   3. We use this result to show that genetical theories of natural/kin
   selection ignore causation and because of this we suggest they shed
   little light on the nature of selection.
   4. When traits expressed by an individual are affected by traits of
   their social partners (indirect genetic effects), we suggest a causal
   partitioning that allows selection to be cast in terms of Hamilton's
   costs and benefits.
   5. We show that previous attempts to understand Hamilton's rule in the
   context of indirect genetic effects either lack generality, or do not
   adequately describe all the ways in which an individual's actions
   constitute a cost to the individual or a benefit to its social
   partner(s).
   6. Our results allow us to explore Hamilton's rule in a multitrait
   setting. We show that evolution always increases inclusive fitness, and
   when the traits are measured in units of generalised genetic distance
   evolutionary change in the traits is in the direction in which inclusive
   fitness increases the fastest.
   7. However, we show that Hamilton's rule only holds in a multitrait
   context when the suite of traits are at equilibrium. When they are out
   of equilibrium, the conditions for altruism to evolve may be more or
   less stringent depending on genetic architecture and how costs and
   benefits are defined.}},

Abstract = {{Models of cooperation among nonkin suggest that social assortment is
   important for the evolution of cooperation. Theory predicts that
   interacting phenotypes, whereby an individual's behavior depends on the
   behavior of its social partners, can drive such social assortment. We
   measured repeated indirect genetic effects (IGEs) during cooperative
   predator inspection in eight populations of Trinidadian guppies
   (Poecilia reticulata) that vary in their evolutionary history of
   predation. Four broad patterns emerged that were dependent on river,
   predation history, and sex: (i) current partner behavior had the largest
   effect on focal behavior, with fish from low-predation habitats
   responding more to their social partners than fish from high-predation
   habitats; (ii) different focal/partner behavior combinations can
   generate cooperation; (iii) some high-predation fish exhibited carryover
   effects across social partners; and (iv) high-predation fish were more
   risk averse. These results provide the first large-scale comparison of
   interacting phenotypes during cooperation across wild animal
   populations, highlighting the potential importance of IGEs in
   maintaining cooperation. Intriguingly, while focal fish responded
   strongly to current social partners, carryover effects between social
   partners suggest generalized reciprocity (in which one helps anyone if
   helped by someone) may contribute to the evolution of cooperation in
   some, but not all, populations of guppies.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are abundant, both in natural and
   domestic populations, and may affect phenotypes of individuals. Recent
   research has demonstrated that the social effect of an individual on the
   phenotype of its social partners may have a genetic component, known as
   an indirect genetic effect (IGE). Little is known, however, of
   nongenetic factors underlying such social effects. Early-life
   environments often have large effects on phenotypes of the individuals
   themselves later in life. Offspring development in many mammalian
   species, for example, depends on interactions with the mother and
   siblings. In domestic pigs, individuals sharing the same juvenile
   environment develop similar body weight later in life. We, therefore,
   hypothesized that offspring originating from the same early-life
   environment also develop common social skills that generate early-life
   social effects (ELSEs) that affect the phenotypes of their social
   partners later in life. We, therefore, quantified IGEs and ELSEs on
   growth in domestic pigs. Results show that individuals from the same
   early-life environment express similar social effects on the growth of
   their social partners, and that such ELSEs shape the growth rate of
   social partners more than IGEs. Thus, the social skills that individuals
   develop in early life have a long-lasting impact on the phenotypes of
   social partners. Early-life and genetic social effects were independent
   of the corresponding direct effects of offspring on their own growth,
   indicating that individuals may enhance the growth of their social
   partners without a personal cost. Our findings also illustrate how
   research devoted to quantifying IGEs may miss nongenetic and potentially
   confounded social mechanisms which may bias the estimates of IGEs.}},

Title = {{Intraspecific Competition and Inbreeding Depression: Increased
   Competitive Effort by Inbred Males Is Costly to Outbred Opponents}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{189}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{539-548}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A recent theoretical model suggests that intraspecific competition is an
   important determinant of the severity of inbreeding depression. The
   reason for this is that intraspecific competition is density dependent,
   leading to a stronger negative effect on inbred individuals if they are
   weaker competitors than outbred ones. In support of this prediction,
   previous empirical work shows that inbred individuals are weaker
   competitors than outbred ones and that intraspecific competition often
   exacerbates inbreeding depression. Here, we report an experiment on the
   burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides, in which we recorded the
   outcome of competition over a small vertebrate carcass between an inbred
   or outbred male resident caring for a brood and a size-matched inbred or
   outbred male intruder. We found that inbred males were more successful
   as intruders in taking over a carcass from a male resident and were
   injured more frequently as either residents or intruders. Furthermore,
   inbred males gained less mass during the breeding attempt and had a
   shorter adult life span than outbred males. Finally, successful resident
   males reared a substantially smaller brood comprised of lighter larvae
   when the intruder was inbred than when it was outbred. Our results shows
   that inbred males increased their competitive effort, thus contradicting
   previous work suggesting that inbred males are weaker competitors.
   Furthermore, our results shows that inbred intruders impose a greater
   cost to resident males, suggesting that outbred individuals can suffer
   fitness costs as a result of competition with inbred ones.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of an individual's phenotypic traits can be influenced by
   genes expressed in its social partners. Theoretical models predict that
   such indirect genetic effects (IGEs) on reproductive traits should play
   an important role in determining the evolutionary outcome of sexual
   conflict. However, empirical tests of (i) whether reproductive IGEs
   exist, (ii) how they vary among genotypes, and (iii) whether they are
   uniform for different types of reproductive traits are largely lacking.
   We addressed this in a series of experiments in the simultaneously
   hermaphroditic flatworm Macrostomum lignano. We found strong evidence
   for IGEs on both morphological and behavioral reproductive traits.
   Partner genotype had a significant impact on the testis size of focal
   individualsvarying up to 2.4-foldsuggesting that IGEs could mediate
   sexual conflicts that target the male sex function. We also found that
   time to first copulation was affected by a genotype x genotype
   interaction between mating partners, and that partner genotype affected
   the propensity to copulate and perform the postcopulatory suck behavior,
   which may mediate conflicts over the fate of received ejaculate
   components. These findings provide clear empirical evidence for IGEs on
   multiple behavioral and morphological reproductive traits, which
   suggests that the evolutionary dynamics of these traits could be altered
   by genes contained in the social environment.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment modulates gene expression, physiology, behaviour
   and patterns of inheritance. For more than 50 years, this concept has
   been investigated using approaches that include partitioning the social
   component out of behavioural heritability estimates, studying maternal
   effects on offspring, and analysing dominance hierarchies. Recent
   advances have formalized this `social environment effect' by providing a
   more nuanced approach to the study of social influences on behaviour
   while recognizing evolutionary implications. Yet, in most of these
   formulations, the dynamics of social interactions are not accounted for.
   Also, the reciprocity between individual behaviour and group-level
   interactions has been largely ignored. Consistent with evolutionary
   theory, the principles of social interaction are conserved across a
   broad range of taxa. While noting parallels in diverse organisms, this
   review uses Drosophila melanogaster as a case study to revisit what is
   known about social interaction paradigms. We highlight the benefits of
   integrating the history and pattern of interactions among individuals
   for dissecting molecular mechanisms that underlie social modulation of
   behaviour.}},

Journal = {{HEREDITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{340-347}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Individuals are not merely subject to their social environments; they
   choose and create them, through a process called social environment (or
   social niche) construction. When genotypes differ in social
   environment-constructing behaviors, different genotypes are expected to
   experience different social environments. As social experience often
   affects behavioral development, quantitative genetics and psychology
   theories predict that genetic variation in social environment
   construction should have an important role in determining phenotypic
   variation; however, this hypothesis has not been tested directly. I
   identify multiple mechanisms of social environment construction that
   differ among natural genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster and
   investigate their consequences for the development of aggressive
   behavior. Male genotypes differed in the group sizes that they preferred
   and in their aggressive behavior; both of these behaviors influenced
   social experience, demonstrating that these behaviors function as social
   environment-constructing traits. Further, the effects of social
   experience-as determined in part by social environment
   construction-carried over to affect focal male aggression at a later
   time and with a new opponent. These results provide manipulative
   experimental support for longstanding hypotheses in psychology, that
   genetic variation in social environment construction has a causal role
   in behavioral development. More broadly, these results imply that
   studies of the genetic basis of complex traits should be expanded to
   include mechanisms by which genetic variation shapes the environments
   that individuals experience.}},

Abstract = {{The study of insect social behavior has offered tremendous insight into
   the molecular mechanisms mediating behavioral and phenotypic plasticity.
   Genomic applications to the study of eusocial insect species, in
   particular, have led to several hypotheses for the processes underlying
   the molecular evolution of behavior. Advances in understanding the
   genetic control of social organization have also been made, suggesting
   an important role for supergenes in the evolution of divergent
   behavioral phenotypes. Intensive study of social phenotypes across
   species has revealed that behavior and caste are controlled by an
   interaction between genetic and environmentally mediated effects and,
   further, that gene expression and regulation mediate plastic responses
   to environmental signals. However, several key methodological flaws that
   are hindering progress in the study of insect social behavior remain.
   After reviewing the current state of knowledge, we outline ongoing
   challenges in experimental design that remain to be overcome in order to
   advance the field.}},

Abstract = {{Social networks encompass both individual and group phenotypes that have
   been shown to covary with fitness in several species. In order for
   network characters to be evolutionarily important, they must reliably
   reflect properties of an individual or groups of individuals; however,
   it is unknown whether network traits are consistently expressed at
   either level. To determine if measurable components of individual social
   network position were repeatable and if the network structure as a whole
   was consistent in Bolitotherus cornutus (the forked fungus beetle), we
   constructed 8 experimental populations. Half of the populations were
   disturbed between 2 observation periods. Two individual network metrics
   (strength and betweenness) were significantly repeatable across time in
   all treatments; a third (clustering coefficient) was not. At the network
   level, all 3 metrics changed more in undisturbed than disturbed
   networks. These findings suggest that individual network position can be
   a consistent property of individuals that is resilient to disturbance
   and could experience selection in a predictable fashion. However, group
   network structure seems to change over time unless reset by disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{The interplay between consistent individual differences in behavior
   (i.e., animal personality) and behavioral plasticity has recently
   attracted increased interest. We used male Australian field crickets
   (Teleogryllus oceanicus) to investigate how dominance status influences
   the consistency and plasticity of different personality traits, namely
   boldness, exploration, and activity, by experimentally manipulating
   dominance status between measuring sessions. We found that dominants
   that became subordinate when socially challenged, shifted their
   behavior, becoming less bold, explorative, and active, whereas
   subordinates that became dominant, became bolder, more explorative, and
   more active. Individuals that experienced no change in dominance status
   did not alter their behavior. Changes in dominance status reduced the
   repeatability of the putative personality traits of exploration and
   activity while not affecting the repeatability of boldness. Moreover,
   changes in dominance status affected the presence of correlations
   between some personality traits, but not others. Finally, calling
   behavior was related to current and future dominance and explorative
   tendencies. We discuss the broader evolutionary and ecological
   implications of our findings and propose that changes in social status
   should be considered when investigating behavioral syndromes and the
   interplay between animal personality and behavioral plasticity.}},

Title = {{Accounting for genetic differences among unknown parents in
   microevolutionary studies: how to include genetic groups in quantitative
   genetic animal models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{7-20}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Quantifying and predicting microevolutionary responses to
   environmental change requires unbiased estimation of quantitative
   genetic parameters in wild populations. `Animal models', which utilize
   pedigree data to separate genetic and environmental effects on
   phenotypes, provide powerful means to estimate key parameters and have
   revolutionized quantitative genetic analyses of wild populations.
   2. However, pedigrees collected in wild populations commonly contain
   many individuals with unknown parents. When unknown parents are
   non-randomly associated with genetic values for focal traits, animal
   model parameter estimates can be severely biased. Yet, such bias has not
   previously been highlighted and statistical methods designed to minimize
   such biases have not been implemented in evolutionary ecology.
   3. We first illustrate how the occurrence of non-random unknown parents
   in population pedigrees can substantially bias animal model predictions
   of breeding values and estimates of additive genetic variance, and
   create spurious temporal trends in predicted breeding values in the
   absence of local selection. We then introduce `genetic group' methods,
   which were developed in agricultural science, and explain how these
   methods can minimize bias in quantitative genetic parameter estimates
   stemming from genetic heterogeneity among individuals with unknown
   parents.
   4. We summarize the conceptual foundations of genetic group animal
   models and provide extensive, step-by-step tutorials that demonstrate
   how to fit such models in a variety of software programs. Furthermore,
   we provide new functions in R that extend current software capabilities
   and provide a standardized approach across software programs to
   implement genetic group methods.
   5. Beyond simply alleviating bias, genetic group animal models can
   directly estimate new parameters pertaining to key biological processes.
   We discuss one such example, where genetic group methods potentially
   allow the microevolutionary consequences of local selection to be
   distinguished from effects of immigration and resulting gene flow.
   6. We highlight some remaining limitations of genetic group models and
   discuss opportunities for further development and application in
   evolutionary ecology. We suggest that genetic group methods should no
   longer be overlooked by evolutionary ecologists, but should become
   standard components of the toolkit for animal model analyses of wild
   population data sets.}},

Abstract = {{Social genetic effects (SGE) are genetic effects of an individual that

   sows (+SGE) and negative SGE sows (-SGE). At the time of selection,
   gilts were contemporaries and similarly managed. We recorded the
   reproductive performance of the two groups based on parity until
   culling. Reproductive performance included the total number of piglets

   weight (BW), coefficient of variation for birth weight (CVBW), age at

Abstract = {{Assessing the impact of the social environment on health and disease is
   challenging. As social effects are in part determined by the genetic
   makeup of social partners, they can be studied from associations between
   genotypes of one individual and phenotype of another (social genetic
   effects, SGE, also called indirect genetic effects). For the first time
   we quantified the contribution of SGE to more than 100 organismal
   phenotypes and genome-wide gene expression measured in laboratory mice.
   We find that genetic variation in cage mates (i.e. SGE) contributes to
   variation in organismal and molecular measures related to anxiety, wound
   healing, immune function, and body weight. Social genetic effects
   explained up to 29\% of phenotypic variance, and for several traits
   their contribution exceeded that of direct genetic effects (effects of
   an individual's genotypes on its own phenotype). Importantly, we show
   that ignoring SGE can severely bias estimates of direct genetic effects
   (heritability). Thus SGE may be an important source of ``missing
   heritability{''} in studies of complex traits in human populations. In
   summary, our study uncovers an important contribution of the social
   environment to phenotypic variation, sets the basis for using SGE to
   dissect social effects, and identifies an opportunity to improve studies
   of direct genetic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are a major driver of social evolution,
   but much of the experimental work pertaining to IGEs on social behaviour
   has focused on the effect of stimulus individuals on single focal
   individuals. We extended IGE research to examine how stimulus
   individuals influence social interactions among several focal
   individuals. Specifically, we relied on recent work on social behaviour
   in fruit flies to examine whether IGEs cause 12 stimulus flies of
   distinct genotypes to alter social interactions within groups of six
   focal flies. The social behaviour of focals was significantly affected
   by the genotype of the stimulus flies. Focals were closer together when
   grouped with stimulus flies from genotypes that were close together than
   when grouped with stimulus flies from genotypes that were farther apart.
   A mechanism mediating this effect was the encounter rate between focal
   flies, which was lowest when the focal flies were grouped with stimulus
   flies of the more cohesive genotypes. (C) 2016 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Parenting strategies can be flexible within a species and may have
   varying fitness effects. Understanding this flexibility and its fitness
   consequences is important for understanding why parenting strategies
   evolve. In the present study, we investigate the fitness consequences of
   flexible parenting in the burying beetle Nicrophorus orbicollis, a
   species known for its advanced provisioning behaviour of regurgitated
   vertebrate carrion to offspring by both sexes. We show that, even when a
   parent is freely allowed to abandon the carcass at any point in time,
   biparental post-hatching care is the most common pattern of care adopted
   in N.orbicollis. Furthermore, two parents together raised more offspring
   than single parents of either sex, showing that the presence of the male
   can directly influence parental fitness even in the absence of
   competitors. This contrasts with studies in other species of burying
   beetle, where biparental families do not differ in offspring number.
   This may explain why biparental care is more common in N.orbicollis than
   in other burying beetles. We suggest how the fitness benefits of two
   parents may play a role in the evolution and maintenance of flexible
   biparental care in N.orbicollis.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment of an animal is an especially interesting
   component of its environment because it can be shaped by both genetic
   and non-genetic variation among social partners. Indirect genetic
   effects (IGEs) are those created when genetic variation in social
   partners contributes to variation in an individual's phenotype; a
   potentially common form of IGE occurs when the expression of a
   behavioral phenotype depends on the particular genotypic combination of
   interacting individuals. Although IGEs can profoundly affect
   individual-and group-level fitness, population dynamics, and even
   community structure, understanding their importance is complicated by
   two inherent challenges: (1) identifying individuals with genetic
   differences in social interactions that can contribute to IGEs and (2)
   characterizing natural social interactions that potentially involve
   IGEs. As a first step toward addressing both these challenges in the
   same system, we investigated social interactions involving genetically
   distinct male color morphs in the poeciliid fish Gambusia holbrooki
   under natural and laboratory conditions. Previous work indicates that
   melanic (M) and silver (S) males differ in social behavior and in how
   conspecifics respond to them, suggesting the potential for IGEs. We used
   a combination of live and video recording of social groups in two
   natural populations and in the laboratory to determine the potential for
   IGEs to contribute to behavioral variation in this species. We found
   that M males had more social partners, and especially more female social
   partners than did S males, in nature and in the laboratory. These
   results suggest that both direct and indirect genetic effects have the
   potential to play a role in the expression and evolution of social
   behavior in G. holbrooki.}},

Title = {{Lifetime changes in phenotypic expression and evolutionary potential of
   female mating traits in Drosophila melanogaster}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},
Pages = {{147-155}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of the ubiquity of female multiple mating has caused an
   important shift in sexual selection research, emphasizing the adaptive
   nature of female mating strategies. While phenotypic changes in female
   mating traits have been previously studied, little is known about the
   genetic basis of female mating behaviour and its potential to respond to
   selection at different stages throughout an individual's life. Using a
   large quantitative genetic breeding design, we observed lifetime female
   mating behaviour in Drosophila melanogaster to examine the effect of
   female age and mating history on three key mating traits: courtship
   latency, mating latency and copula duration. Courtship latency (time
   until males initiate courtship) decreased with the cumulative number of
   females' previous matings. Mating latency (defined here as the time
   between the beginning of courtship and the start of copulation)
   increased with female age, and copula duration was found to decrease as
   females aged. We calculated quantitative genetic estimates for mating
   traits in virgin females and at the females' third mating to examine
   changes in the evolutionary potential of mating traits. We found
   considerable additive genetic variation in courtship latency and mating
   latency measured in virgin females. Copula duration displayed no
   heritable variation among females across sire families, but male effects
   were consistent with the idea that this trait is under male control.
   Heritability estimates differed significantly from zero in virgin
   females for courtship latency and mating latency but not when females
   were mating for the third time. However, overlapping 84\% confidence
   intervals between heritability estimates obtained from virgin and mated
   females suggest that female mating strategies may have the potential to
   respond to selection at these different life stages. (C) 2016 The

Title = {{Direct and indirect genetic and fine-scale location effects on breeding
   date in song sparrows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1613-1624}},

Abstract = {{1. Quantifying direct and indirect genetic effects of interacting
   females and males on variation in jointly expressed life-history traits
   is central to predicting microevolutionary dynamics. However, accurately
   estimating sex-specific additive genetic variances in such traits
   remains difficult in wild populations, especially if related individuals
   inhabit similar fine-scale environments.
   2. Breeding date is a key life-history trait that responds to
   environmental phenology and mediates individual and population responses
   to environmental change. However, no studies have estimated female
   (direct) and male (indirect) additive genetic and inbreeding effects on
   breeding date, and estimated the cross-sex genetic correlation, while
   simultaneously accounting for fine-scale environmental effects of
   breeding locations, impeding prediction of microevolutionary dynamics.
   3. We fitted animal models to 38 years of song sparrow (Melospiza
   melodia) phenology and pedigree data to estimate sex-specific additive
   genetic variances in breeding date, and the cross-sex genetic
   correlation, thereby estimating the total additive genetic variance
   while simultaneously estimating sex-specific inbreeding depression. We
   further fitted three forms of spatial animal model to explicitly
   estimate variance in breeding date attributable to breeding location,
   overlap among breeding locations and spatial autocorrelation. We thereby
   quantified fine-scale location variances in breeding date and quantified
   the degree to which estimating such variances affected the estimated
   additive genetic variances.
   4. The non-spatial animal model estimated nonzero female and male
   additive genetic variances in breeding date (sex-specific
   heritabilities: 0.07 and 0.02, respectively) and a strong, positive
   cross-sex genetic correlation (0.99), creating substantial total
   additive genetic variance (0.18). Breeding date varied with female, but
   not male inbreeding coefficient, revealing direct, but not indirect,
   inbreeding depression. All three spatial animal models estimated small
   location variance in breeding date, but because relatedness and breeding
   location were virtually uncorrelated, modelling location variance did
   not alter the estimated additive genetic variances.
   5. Our results show that sex-specific additive genetic effects on
   breeding date can be strongly positively correlated, which would affect
   any predicted rates of microevolutionary change in response to sexually
   antagonistic or congruent selection. Further, we show that inbreeding
   effects on breeding date can also be sex specific and that genetic
   effects can exceed phenotypic variation stemming from fine-scale
   location-based variation within a wild population.}},

Abstract = {{Males of socially monogamous species can increase their siring success
   via within-pair and extra-pair fertilizations. In this study, we focused
   on the different sources of (co)variation between these siring routes,
   and asked how each contributes to total siring success. We quantified
   the fertilization routes to siring success, as well as behaviors that
   have been hypothesized to affect siring success, over a five-year period
   for a wild population of great tits Parus major. We considered siring
   success and its fertilization routes as ``interactive phenotypes{''}
   arising from phenotypic contributions of both members of the social
   pair. We show that siring success is strongly affected by the fecundity
   of the social (female) partner. We also demonstrate that a strong
   positive correlation between extra-pair fertilization success and
   paternity loss likely constrains the evolution of these two routes.
   Moreover, we show that more explorative and aggressive males had less
   extra-pair fertilizations, whereas more explorative females laid larger
   clutches. This study thus demonstrates that (co)variation in siring
   routes is caused by multiple factors not necessarily related to
   characteristics of males. We thereby highlight the importance of
   acknowledging the multilevel structure of male fertilization routes when
   studying the evolution of male mating strategies.}},

Title = {{Genomic prediction of survival time in a population of brown laying hens
   showing cannibalistic behavior}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mortality due to cannibalism causes both economic and
   welfare problems in laying hens. To limit mortality due to cannibalism,
   laying hens are often beak-trimmed, which is undesirable for animal
   welfare reasons. Genetic selection is an alternative strategy to
   increase survival and is more efficient by taking heritable variation
   that originates from social interactions into account, which are
   modelled as the so-called indirect genetic effects (IGE). Despite the
   considerable heritable variation in survival time due to IGE, genetic
   improvement of survival time in laying hens is still challenging because
   the detected heritable variation of the trait with IGE is still limited,
   ranging from 0.06 to 0.26, and individuals that are still alive at the
   end of the recording period are censored. Furthermore, survival time
   records are available late in life and only on females. To cope with
   these challenges, we tested the hypothesis that genomic prediction
   increases the accuracy of estimated breeding values (EBV) compared to
   parental average EBV, and increases response to selection for survival
   time compared to a traditional breeding scheme. We tested this
   hypothesis in two lines of brown layers with intact beaks, which show
   cannibalism, and also the hypothesis that the rate of inbreeding per
   year is lower for genomic selection than for the traditional breeding
   scheme.
   Results and discussion: The standard deviation of genomic prediction EBV
   for survival time was around 22 days for both lines, indicating good
   prospects for selection against mortality in laying hens with intact
   beaks. Genomic prediction increased the accuracy of the EBV by 35 and 32
   \% compared to the parent average EBV for the two lines. At the current
   reference population size, predicted response to selection was 91 \%
   higher when using genomic selection than with the traditional breeding
   scheme, as a result of a shorter generation interval in males and
   greater accuracy of selection in females. The predicted rate of
   inbreeding per generation with truncation selection was substantially
   lower for genomic selection than for the traditional breeding scheme for
   both lines.
   Conclusions: Genomic selection for socially affected traits is a
   promising tool for the improvement of survival time in laying hens with
   intact beaks.}},

Abstract = {{A key requirement for social cooperation is the mitigation and/or social
   regulation of aggression towards other group members. Populations of the
   harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus show the alternate social
   phenotypes of queens founding nests alone (haplometrosis) or in groups
   of unrelated yet cooperative individuals (pleometrosis). Pleometrotic
   queens display an associated reduction in aggression. To understand the
   proximate drivers behind this variation, we placed foundresses of the
   two populations into social environments with queens from the same or
   the alternate population, and measured their behaviour and head gene
   expression profiles. A proportion of queens from both populations
   behaved aggressively, but haplometrotic queens were significantly more
   likely to perform aggressive acts, and conflict escalated more
   frequently in pairs of haplometrotic queens. Whole-head RNA sequencing
   revealed variation in gene expression patterns, with the two populations
   showing moderate differentiation in overall transcriptional profile,
   suggesting that genetic differences underlie the two founding
   strategies. The largest detected difference, however, was associated
   with aggression, regardless of queen founding type. Several modules of
   coregulated genes, involved in metabolism, immune system and neuronal
   function, were found to be upregulated in highly aggressive queens.
   Conversely, nonaggressive queens exhibited a striking pattern of
   upregulation in chemosensory genes. Our results highlight that the
   social phenotypes of cooperative vs. solitary nest founding tap into a
   set of gene regulatory networks that seem to govern aggression level. We
   also present a number of highly connected hub genes associated with
   aggression, providing opportunity to further study the genetic
   underpinnings of social conflict and tolerance.}},

Title = {{From facultative to obligatory parental care: Interspecific variation in
   offspring dependency on post-hatching care in burying beetles}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{Studies on the evolution of parental care have focused primarily on the
   costs and benefits of parental care and the life-history attributes that
   favour it. However, once care evolves, offspring in some taxa appear to
   become increasingly dependent on their parents. Although offspring
   dependency is a central theme in family life, the evolutionary dynamics
   leading to it are not fully understood. Beetles of the genus Nicrophorus
   are well known for their elaborate biparental care, including
   provisioning of their young. By manipulating the occurrence of pre- or
   post-hatching care, we show that the offspring of three burying beetle
   species, N. orbicollis, N. pustulatus, and N. vespilloides, show
   striking variation in their reliance on parental care. Our results
   demonstrate that this variation within one genus arises through a
   differential dependency of larvae on parental feeding, but not on
   pre-hatching care. In N. pustulatus, larvae appear to be nutritionally
   independent of their parents, but in N. orbicollis, larvae do not
   survive in the absence of parental feeding. We consider evolutionary
   scenarios by which nutritional dependency may have evolved, highlighting
   the role of brood size regulation via infanticide in this genus.}},

Abstract = {{In animal contests, individuals respond plastically to the phenotypes of
   the opponents that they confront. These ``opponent{''}aEuro{''}or
   ``indirect{''}aEuro{''}effects are often repeatable, for example,
   certain opponents consistently elicit more or less aggressiveness in
   others. ``Personality{''} (repeatable among-individual variation in
   behavior) has been proposed as an important source of indirect effects.
   Here, we repeatedly assayed aggressiveness of wild-caught adult male
   field crickets Gryllus campestris in staged dyadic fights, measuring
   aggressiveness of both contestants. Measurements of their personality in
   nonsocial contexts (activity and exploration behavior) enabled us to ask
   whether personality caused indirect effects on aggressiveness. Activity,
   exploration, and aggressiveness were positively associated into a
   behavioral syndrome eliciting aggressiveness in conspecifics, providing
   direct evidence for the role of personality in causing indirect effects.
   Our findings imply that a multivariate view of phenotypes that includes
   indirect effects greatly improves our ability to understand the ecology
   and evolution of behavior.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1062-1072}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In the past decade, ecologists have begun to more fully appreciate the
   role of evolution in explaining contemporary ecological processes.
   Evolution is most likely to affect ecological patterns when selection
   pressure is particularly strong, or when the generation time of at least
   one interacting species is relatively short. Interactions between plants
   and soil microbes are an excellent candidate for examining eco-evo
   interactions because interactions between organisms are tightly knit
   with the potential for species with relatively short generation times to
   impose strong selection on one another. Here, we examine the potential
   for eco-evolutionary dynamics in plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs). Genetic
   variation in plant traits and subsequent evolution of those traits can
   affect traits and species composition of soil microbial communities.
   Soil microbial communities can, in turn, alter the evolutionary
   trajectory of plant traits. Further, the direction and magnitude of PSFs
   can affect the plant community, which may alter the selection on plant
   traits via intra- and interspecific interactions. Finally, we consider
   how eco-evolutionary feedbacks might enhance or mitigate the effects of
   PSFs in driving the structure of natural plant communities.}},

   Monogamy, however, could influence the subsequent evolution of

   exclusive, evolutionary processes that could explain the correlated
   evolution of monogamy and cooperation. Our analysis of these
   possibilities reveals that many ecological or social factors can affect
   all three variables of Hamilton's Rule simultaneously, thus calling for
   a more holistic, systems-level approach to studying the evolution of
   social traits. This perspective reveals novel dimensions to
   coevolutionary relationships and provides solutions for assigning
   causality in complex cases of correlated social trait evolution, such as
   the sequential evolution of monogamy and cooperation.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{53-59}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB) represents an emergent trait of two
   interacting same-sex individuals. Although empirical studies have
   investigated how social environments can influence SSB, little is known
   about the effect of the interacting partner and its associated phenotype
   on SSB. In species where females are larger than males or males express
   male-specific behaviour, a male's morphology or behaviour can serve as a
   way for other males to recognize its sex and express SSBs. Here we used
   both a trait-based and variance-partitioning approach to test for the
   effect of the interacting male's identity and his multivariate phenotype
   on SSB, using water striders, Gerris lacustris, as a model. We
   repeatedly subjected males to dyadic interactions with the same and
   different partners and measured their SSBs. We used the
   variance-partitioning approach to estimate the partner's identity
   effect, and the trait-based approach to assess which trait of the
   partner explains changes in SSB. We found that the partner's SSB reduced
   the tendency of males to show SSB. SSB was affected by their interacting
   partner's identity, but the partner effect was not due to the repeatable
   components ('personality') of the partner's SSB. Males also did not
   differ in their responses to variation in the partner's SSB at different
   levels (between-partner, or partner `personality', and within-partner
   levels, or partner `plasticity'). Taken together, these findings provide
   the first empirical evidence that SSB can be plastically expressed in
   response to traits in social partners. We also highlight the usefulness
   of combining the trait-based and variance-partitioning approach to test
   whether partners represent a component of the social environment
   affecting the expression of labile traits. (C) 2016 The Association for

Abstract = {{The degree of inbreeding expressed within populations can profoundly
   shape evolutionary dynamics. The degree to which individuals inbreed is
   frequently assumed to evolve in response to selection, for example,
   resulting from inbreeding depression. Such evolutionary responses
   require additive genetic variance (V-A) in the degree to which
   individuals inbreed. However, the magnitude of V-A in the degree of
   biparental inbreeding has never been estimated. We devised a
   quantitative genetic model to estimate sex-specific V-A in the degree to
   which individuals inbreed while accounting for effects of individuals'
   own coefficients of inbreeding and genetic effects stemming from
   immigration. We applied this model to the degree of inbreeding expressed
   through social pairing in free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia).
   Estimates of V-A for both sexes appreciably exceeded 0 and the cross-sex
   genetic covariance was strongly positive, creating substantial total V-A
   in the degree of inbreeding. Our analyses also revealed inbreeding
   depression in the degree of inbreeding, such that more inbred
   individuals paired with closer relatives, and immigrant effects, such
   that individuals with greater genomic contributions from immigrants
   paired with more distant relatives. We thereby demonstrate that the
   degree of biparental inbreeding can show substantial V-A in nature and
   might consequently evolve in response to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Polyandry is widespread despite its costs. The sexually selected sperm
   hypotheses ('sexy' and `good' sperm) posit that sperm competition plays
   a role in the evolution of polyandry. Two poorly studied assumptions of
   these hypotheses are the presence of additive genetic variance in
   polyandry and sperm competitiveness. Using a quantitative genetic
   breeding design in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster, we
   first established the potential for polyandry to respond to selection.
   We then investigated whether polyandry can evolve through sexually
   selected sperm processes. We measured lifetime polyandry and offensive
   sperm competitiveness (P-2) while controlling for sampling variance due
   to male x male x female interactions. We also measured additive genetic
   variance in egg-to-adult viability and controlled for its effect on P-2
   estimates. Female lifetime polyandry showed significant and substantial
   additive genetic variance and evolvability. In contrast, we found little
   genetic variance or evolvability in P-2 or egg-to-adult viability.
   Additive genetic variance in polyandry highlights its potential to
   respond to selection. However, the low levels of genetic variance in
   sperm competitiveness suggest that the evolution of polyandry may not be
   driven by sexy sperm or good sperm processes.}},

Title = {{Males adjust their signalling behaviour according to experience of male

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Sexual signals are conspicuous sources of information about neighbouring
   competitors, and species in which males and females signal during pair
   formation provide various sources of public information to which
   individuals can adjust their behaviour. We performed two experiments
   with a duetting vibrational insect, Enchenopa binotata treehoppers
   (Hemiptera: Membracidae), to ask whether males adjust their signalling
   behaviour according to (1a) their own experience of competitors'
   signals, (1b) how females adjust their mate preferences on the basis of
   their experience of male signals (described in prior work), and/or (2)
   their own experience of female response signals to competitors' signals.
   We presented males with synthetic male signals of different frequencies
   and combinations thereof for 2weeks. We recorded males a day after their
   last signal exposure, finding that (1a) male signal rate increased in
   response to experience of attractive competitors, but that (1b) male
   signal frequency did not shift in a manner consistent with how females
   adjust their mate preferences in those experience treatments. Second, we
   presented males with different male-female duets for 2weeks, finding
   that (2) male signal length increased from experience of female duets
   with attractive competitors. Males thus make two types of adjustment
   according to two sources of public information: one provided by
   experience of male signals and another by experience of female responses
   to male signals. Signalling plasticity can generate feedback loops
   between the adjustments that males and females make, and we discuss the
   potential consequences of such feedback loops for the evolution of
   communication systems.}},

   whether a population-level social niche can be meaningfully identified,

   focusing on social niche construction. We highlight questions about

Abstract = {{Aggregation behaviour is the tendency for animals to group together,
   which may have important consequences on individual fitness. We used a
   combination of experimental and simulation approaches to study how
   genetic variation and social environment interact to influence
   aggregation dynamics in Drosophila. To do this, we used two different
   natural lines of Drosophila that arise from a polymorphism in the
   foraging gene (rovers and sitters). We placed groups of flies in a
   heated arena. Flies could freely move towards one of two small, cooler
   refuge areas. In groups of the same strain, sitters had a greater
   tendency to aggregate. The observed behavioural variation was based on
   only two parameters: the probability of entering a refuge and the
   likelihood of choosing a refuge based on the number of individuals
   present. We then directly addressed how different strains interact by
   mixing rovers and sitters within a group. Aggregation behaviour of each
   line was strongly affected by the presence of the other strain, without
   changing the decision rules used by each. Individuals obeying local
   rules shaped complex group dynamics via a constant feedback loop between
   the individual and the group. This study could help to identify the
   circumstances under which particular group compositions may improve
   individual fitness through underlying aggregation mechanisms under
   specific environmental conditions.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Social context refers to the composition of an individual's social
   interactants, including potential mates. In spatially structured
   populations, social context can vary among individuals within
   populations, generating the opportunity for social selection to drive
   differences in fitness functions among individuals at a fine spatial
   scale. In sexually polymorphic plants, the local sex ratio varies at a
   fine scale and thus has the potential to generate this opportunity. We
   measured the spatial distribution of two wild populations of the
   gynodioecious plant Silene vulgaris and show that there is fine-scale
   heterogeneity in the local distribution of the sexes within these
   populations. We demonstrate that the largest variance in sex ratio is
   among nearest neighbors. This variance is greatly reduced as the spatial
   scale of social interactions increases. These patterns suggest the sex
   of neighbors has the potential to generate fine-scale differences in
   selection differentials among individuals. One of the most important
   determinants of social interactions in plants is the behavior of
   pollinators. These results suggest that the potential for selection
   arising from sex ratio will be greatest when pollen is shared among
   nearest neighbors. Future studies incorporating the movement of
   pollinators may reveal whether and how this fine-scale variance in sex
   ratio affects the fitness of individuals in these populations.}},

Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{329-338}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondria are involved in ageing and their function requires
   coordinated action of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Epistasis
   between the two genomes can influence lifespan but whether this also
   holds for reproductive senescence is unclear. Maternal inheritance of
   mitochondria predicts sex differences in the efficacy of selection on
   mitonuclear genotypes that should result in differences between females
   and males in mitochondrial genetic effects. Mitonuclear genotype of a
   focal individual may also indirectly affect trait expression in the
   mating partner. We tested these predictions in the seed beetle
   Callosobruchus maculatus, using introgression lines harbouring distinct
   mitonuclear genotypes. Our results reveal both direct and indirect
   sexspecific effects of mitonuclear epistasis on reproductive ageing.
   Females harbouring coadapted mitonuclear genotypes showed higher
   lifetime fecundity due to slower senescence relative to novel
   mitonuclear combinations. We found no evidence for mitonuclear
   coadaptation in males. Mitonuclear epistasis not only affected
   age-specific ejaculate weight, but also influenced male age-dependent
   indirect effects on traits expressed by their female partners
   (fecundity, egg size, longevity). These results demonstrate important
   consequences of sex-specific mitonuclear epistasis for both mating
   partners, consistent with a role for mitonuclear genetic constraints
   upon sex-specific adaptive evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Parental care, a central component of reproduction in a wide range of
   animal species, often involves elaborate behavioural interactions
   between parents and their offspring. Due to the reciprocal nature of
   these interactions, it has been hypothesized that parental and offspring
   behaviours (e.g. parental food provisioning and offspring begging) are
   not only target but also agent of selection. These traits are therefore
   expected to co-evolve, ultimately leading to co-adaptation of parent and
   offspring behaviours within families. However, empirical data on such
   parent-offspring co-adaptation are limited, particularly for wild
   populations. Furthermore, mean levels of behaviour (as measured in
   previous studies) may not adequately describe the dynamic nature of the
   reciprocal interplay between parents and their offspring, and instead
   rather the behavioural reaction norms for provisioning and begging may
   be co-adapted. We applied a large-scale cross-fostering study over 3
   consecutive breeding seasons to investigate whether provisioning
   behaviour of wild blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) parents covaries with
   the begging behaviour of their genetic, cross-fostered offspring. We
   simultaneously analysed parent and offspring behaviours, both as static
   traits (mean levels) and behavioural reaction norms (offspring begging
   as a function of food deprivation and parental provisioning as a
   function of short-term experimental changes in brood size). Neither
   maternal nor paternal provisioning rates covaried with the begging
   intensity of their genetic offspring when analysed as mean levels of
   behaviour. However, the slopes of the reaction norms for provisioning
   and begging were negatively correlated between male, but not female,
   parents and their genetic offspring. Thus, fathers that change their
   provisioning rate strongly with brood size sire offspring whose level of
   begging only weakly increases with hunger, and vice versa. The observed
   covariation suggests the existence of sex-specific optima for
   parent-offspring trait combinations. Thus, our study not only highlights
   the importance of a behavioural reaction norm approach when
   investigating parent-offspring interactions, but also stresses the
   relevance of considering parents as separate units, at least for
   biparental species.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are abundant, both in wild and in
   domestic populations. With social interactions, the genes of an
   individual may affect the trait values of other individuals, a
   phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects (IGEs). IGEs can be
   estimated using linear mixed models. Most IGE models assume that
   individuals interact equally to all group mates irrespective of
   relatedness. Kin selection theory, however, predicts that an individual
   will interact differently with family members versus non-family members.
   Here, we investigate kin-and sex-specific non-genetic social
   interactions in group-housed mink. Furthermore, we investigated whether
   systematic non-genetic interactions between kin or individuals of the
   same sex influence the estimates of genetic parameters. As a second
   objective, we clarify the relationship between estimates of the
   traditional IGE model and a family-based IGE model proposed in a
   previous study. Our results indicate that male siblings in mink show
   different non-genetic interactions than female siblings in mink and that
   this may impact the estimation of genetic parameters. Moreover, we have
   shown how estimates from a family-based IGE model can be translated to
   the ordinary direct-indirect model and vice versa. We find no evidence
   for genetic differences in interactions among related versus unrelated
   mink.}},

Title = {{Comparison of designs for estimating genetic parameters and obtaining
   response to selection for social interaction traits in aquaculture}},
Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},

Volume = {{451}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals may affect individual productivity
   and welfare in aquaculture. Since social effects may have a genetic
   component, known as an indirect genetic effect (IGE), genetic selection
   may be a promising tool to simultaneously improve welfare and
   productivity in aquaculture. Here we compare two experimental designs
   that have been previously proposed for the genetic improvement of
   socially affected traits. We used stochastic simulations to compare a
   design where each group consisted of members of two families (2-FAM)
   with a design where each group consisted of members of three families
   (3-FAM). The 2-FAM and 3-FAM designs were compared using an equal number
   of groups (96 groups). The group size, i.e., number of individuals
   within each group, was either 30 or 60 individuals. Both designs were
   compared for the precision of estimated direct and social genetic
   parameters and for response to selection, either with or without a
   restriction on the rate of inbreeding. Four different schemes with a low
   variance (heritability for social effects or h(S)(2)=0.1), a moderate
   variance (h(S)(2) = 0.3), or a high variance (h(S)(2) = 0.5) of the
   social genetic effects, and a negative correlation between direct and
   social genetic effects (rA(D, S) = -0.6) were compared. The negative
   rAD, S indicates competition between group mates. Differences in
   precision of estimated genetic parameters between both designs were
   small. At low h(S)(2) and group size of 30, the 2-FAM design was
   superior with respect to precision of social additive genetic variance.
   When the social genetic variance was small, a larger group size, e.g. 60
   is recommended. The 2-FAM design resulted in a higher accuracy of
   selection for social and total genetic effects, but also in a higher
   rate of inbreeding compared to the 3-FAM design. When the rate of
   inbreeding was restricted to similar to 2\%, the total response to
   selection was significantly higher for the 3-FAM design. In conclusion,
   the 2-FAM and 3-FAM designs differ little in accuracy of the direct and
   social genetic parameter estimates, while the 3-FAM design is superior
   with respect to the response to selection at a fixed rate of inbreeding.
   This study is particularly important for making decisions regarding
   experimental design when breeding for social genetic effects in
   aquaculture.
   Statement of relevance: Communal or family rearing with a large number
   of animals in a group is common practice in aquaculture. Large variation
   in body size, which may inflate competition for feed, is generally
   observed in the communal rearing tank. In addition, cannibalistic or
   aggressive behaviour is frequently observed in a large variety of fish
   species. So far, the issue is addressed by management measures, such as
   size grading, which may be labour intensive. Sustainable solutions
   through selective breeding have not been tested.
   Previous studies compared two experimental designs for social
   interaction traits; groups composed of two families (2-FAM) and three
   families (3-FAM) with groups composed at random and found that the 2-FAM
   and 3-FAM designs were better with respect to genetic parameter
   estimates than designs with groups composed at random. It is however
   still unknown whether the 2-FAM or the 3-FAM design is better. Previous
   studies did not consider the rate of inbreeding when studying the
   designs. This paper describes the results from a comparison of the two
   experimental designs for estimating genetic parameters and obtaining
   response to selection, taking into account the rate of inbreeding. As
   such, this paper should be of interest to a broad readership including
   those interested in aquaculture genetics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Increased maternal age at reproduction is often associated with
   decreased offspring performance in numerous species of plants and
   animals (including humans). Current evolutionary theory considers such
   maternal effect senescence as part of a unified process of reproductive
   senescence, which is under identical age-specific selective pressures to
   fertility. We offer a novel theoretical perspective by combining William
   Hamilton's evolutionary model for aging with a quantitative genetic
   model of indirect genetic effects. We demonstrate that fertility and
   maternal effect senescence are likely to experience different patterns
   of age-specific selection and thus can evolve to take divergent forms.
   Applied to neonatal survival, we find that selection for maternal
   effects is the product of age-specific fertility and Hamilton's
   age-specific force of selection for fertility. Population genetic models
   show that senescence for these maternal effects can evolve in the
   absence of reproductive or actuarial senescence; this implies that
   maternal effect aging is a fundamentally distinct demographic
   manifestation of the evolution of aging. However, brief periods of
   increasingly beneficial maternal effects can evolve when fertility
   increases with age faster than cumulative survival declines. This is
   most likely to occur early in life. Our integration of theory provides a
   general framework with which to model, measure, and compare the
   evolutionary determinants of the social manifestations of aging.
   Extension of our maternal effects model to other ecological and social
   contexts could provide important insights into the drivers of the
   astonishing diversity of lifespans and aging patterns observed among
   species.}},

Abstract = {{It is often assumed that there is a positive relationship between egg
   size and offspring fitness. However, recent studies have suggested that
   egg size has a greater effect on offspring fitness in low-quality
   environments than in highquality environments. Such observations suggest
   that mothers may compensate for poor posthatching environments by
   increasing egg size. In this paper we test whether there is a limit on
   the extent to which increased egg size can compensate for the removal of
   posthatching parental care in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus
   vespilloides. Previous experiments with N. vespilloides suggest that an
   increased egg size can compensate for a relatively poor environment
   after hatching. Here, we phenotypically engineered female N.
   vespilloides to produce large or small eggs by varying the amount of
   time they were allowed to feed on the carcass as larvae. We then tested
   whether differences between these groups in egg size translated into
   differences in larval performance in a harsh postnatal environment that
   excluded parental care. We found that females engineered to produce
   large eggs did not have higher breeding success, and nor did they
   produce larger larvae than females engineered to produce small eggs.
   These results suggest that there is a limit on the extent to which
   increased maternal investment in egg size can compensate for a poor
   posthatching environment. We discuss the implication of our results for
   a recent study showing that experimental N. vespilloides populations can
   adapt rapidly to the absence of posthatching parental care.}},

Abstract = {{Debates about how coevolution of sexual traits and preferences might
   promote evolutionary diversification have permeated speciation research
   for over a century. Recent work demonstrates that the expression of such
   traits can be sensitive to variation in the social environment. Here, we
   examined social flexibility in a sexually selected male trait-cuticular
   hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles-in the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus
   and tested whether population genetic divergence predicts the extent or
   direction of social flexibility in allopatric populations. We
   manipulated male crickets' social environments during rearing and then
   characterized CHC profiles. CHC signatures varied considerably across
   populations and also in response to the social environment, but our
   prediction that increased social flexibility would be selected in more
   recently founded populations exposed to fluctuating demographic
   environments was unsupported. Furthermore, models examining the
   influence of drift and selection failed to support a role of sexual
   selection in driving population divergence in CHC profiles. Variation in
   social environments might alter the dynamics of sexual selection, but
   our results align with theoretical predictions that the role social
   flexibility plays in modulating evolutionary divergence depends
   critically on whether responses to variation in the social environment
   are homogeneous across populations, or whether gene by social
   environment interactions occur.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are the basis of social interactions
   among conspecifics, and can affect genetic variation of nonsocial and
   social traits. We used flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) of two
   phenotypically distinguishable populations to estimate genetic
   (co)variances and the effect of IGEs on three life-history traits:
   development time (DT), growth rate (GR), and pupal body mass (BM). We
   found that GR was strongly affected by social environment with IGEs
   accounting for 18\% of the heritable variation. We also discovered a
   sex-specific social effect: male ratio in a group significantly affected
   both GR and BM; that is, beetles grew larger and faster in male-biased
   social environments. Such sex-specific IGEs have not previously been
   demonstrated in a nonsocial insect. Our results show that beetles that
   achieve a higher BM do so via a slower GR in response to social
   environment. Existing models of evolution in age-structured or
   stage-structured populations do not account for IGEs of social cohorts.
   It is likely that such IGEs have played a key role in the evolution of
   developmental plasticity shown by Tenebrionid larvae in response to
   density. Our results document an important source of genetic variation
   for GR, often overlooked in life-history theory.}},

   Selection and Sex-Limited Expression on the Evolution of Social Insect
   Genomes}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Kin selection theory has always been explicitly genetic and has long
   been invoked to explain the evolution of the sterile worker caste in the
   social insects. However, sociogenomic studies of the evolution and
   genomic basis of social insect caste have been largely disconnected from
   kin selection theory and other related genetic theories of social
   evolution. Two previous population genetic models make testable
   predictions for patterns of sequence diversity for genes shaped
   indirectly by kin selection compared to genes shaped directly by natural
   selection, but there is some confusion in the literature regarding the
   predicted effects of kin selection and sex-limited expression on
   molecular evolution. We review the previous models and then use a simple
   parental effect model to clarify that the two factors, kin selection and
   sex-limited expression, are distinct and each has a separate effect on
   the expected patterns of molecular evolution. We further build on the
   previous models to show how categories of genes in social insect genomes
   with diverse combinations of fitness effects (direct, parental, sib, and
   offspring) and patterns of sex-limitation are predicted to evolve. We
   discuss how caste- and sex-specific transcriptomic profiling, coupled
   with population genomic data, can be used to identify different
   functional categories of genes and subsequently test whether observed
   patterns of molecular evolution fit theoretical predictions.}},

   strain of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus)}},
Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{450}},

Abstract = {{Trait values of individuals are affected not only by their genetic
   makeup, but also by environmental factors and interactions with other
   individuals. The heritable effect of an individual on the trait values
   of other individuals it interacts with is known as an indirect genetic
   effect (IGE). Such IGEs may affect response to selection. Fish selected
   for high growth rate, for example, have been shown to be more aggressive
   and competitive, which may reduce the observed response in growth rate.
   The main objective of this study is to quantify the genetic and
   non-genetic indirect effects for harvest weight in the GIFT strain of
   Nile tilapia. A total of 6330 fish with harvest weight information were
   used to estimate genetic and non-genetic parameters. A bivariate
   analysis of harvest weight and survival was conducted by fitting
   different mixed models to investigate the presence of IGEs and other
   non-genetic effects. The full set of genetic parameters could not be
   estimated simultaneously with the inclusion of maternal common
   environmental effects. A confounding between maternal common
   environmental effects and direct genetic effects resulted from the
   mating strategy, where one sire was mated to only one or two dams. A 1
   male to 2 females mating design is common in aquaculture, but it has
   limited power to estimate genetic parameters. Models without maternal
   common environmental effects showed significant IGE on harvest weight,
   which contributed 48\% of total heritable variance. Models with maternal
   common environmental effects suggested the presence of IGE. The
   direct-indirect genetic correlation for harvest weight was negative
   (-0.38 +/- 0.19), indicating that traditional selection, if performed in
   an environment where the fish have to compete with each other for the
   resources, will increase competition. A strongly negative genetic
   correlation between direct effects on survival and indirect effects on
   harvest weight (-0.79 +/- 0.30) showed that individuals with better
   genes for survival suppressed growth rate of their social partners. Our
   results suggest that heritable competitive interactions affect harvest
   weight in Nile tilapia. Hence, breeding schemes may need to be adapted
   to avoid an increase in aggressiveness due to selection for growth rate
   in a competitive environment. Further studies are required to
   investigate the relevance of IGE and its implications on different
   systems of commercial aquaculture production. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Spurred on by technological advances, the last several years have seen
   an explosion of studies of behavioral, genomic, and neurophysiological
   mechanisms of social behaviors. Yet these empirical studies and the vast
   amount of data they produce are typically disconnected from
   well-established social evolution theory. We argue that unlocking the
   transformative potential of the emerging empirical approaches to social
   behavior requires new kinds of theoretical approaches that integrate
   proximate behavioral, genomic, and neurophysiological mechanisms with
   evolutionary dynamics. We review recent efforts in this direction that
   show how proximate mechanisms are important for evolutionary dynamics.
   However, we argue that these frameworks are still too distant from
   empirical systems to interface with emerging datasets. As an example of
   improved approaches that can be developed, we focus on the evolution of
   social gene regulatory networks, and discuss how integrating dynamics of
   gene regulatory networks with social evolution theory can result in
   rigorous hypotheses that are testable with sociogenomic data.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing an opponent's strength is an important component of attack
   strategies in territorial combats between males. Body size is often
   considered to directly influence an individual's strength, but other
   honest visual signals may also affect the assessment of opponents. Among
   such visual signals are the so-called egg-spots, a conspicuous ovoid
   marking on the anal fin of male haplochromine cichlid fishes, made up of
   carotenoid-containing and other pigment cells. It has long been assumed
   that egg-spots are mainly relevant in courtship and spawning behavior,
   and previous work has focused primarily on their function in intersexual
   selection. Recently, however, both body size and egg-spots have been
   suggested to play a role in male-male interactions. To test whether
   egg-spots function in female choice or whether egg-spots and/or body
   size function as a predictor of strength and the subsequent attack
   strategy in male-male interactions, we performed a series of behavioral
   experiments in the haplochromine cichlid Astatotilapia calliptera. The
   trials revealed a limited involvement of egg-spots in female choice, yet
   a much stronger influence in male interactions. Territorial males
   combined information from the strength assessment based on body size and
   egg-spots to adopt their attack strategies. They launched more attacks
   against the larger intruder with many egg-spots compared with the
   smaller intruder without or with fewer egg-spots. Our study provides
   evidence that egg-spots serve as honest visual signal and that the level
   of asymmetries in egg-spot pattern and body size determines the relative
   impact of each trait in strength assessment.}},

Title = {{Male birch catkin bugs vary copula duration to invest more in matings
   with novel females}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{161-166}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recent developments in the study of mating behaviour have emphasized the
   importance of strategic investment of limited reproductive resources.
   However, in many cases it can be difficult to interpret traits such as
   copula duration, because they are interacting phenotypes that ultimately
   depend upon both the male and female mating partner, and the sexes may
   frequently disagree over the optimal outcome. Here we report the results
   of experiments designed to establish which sex controls copula duration
   in the birch catkin bug, Kleidocerys resedae, and to test for strategic
   investment by the controlling sex. First, we found that matings of
   field-caught individuals were relatively short, but that copula duration
   increased following a period of sexual isolation, reaching a maximum
   after 2 days. However, copula duration was again shorter in re-pairings
   of the same individuals 1 h after their first mating. Because these
   results could be interpreted as a response to sexual isolation by either
   sex, we next investigated whether copula duration is under male or
   female control in this species. Experimental pairings between males and
   females isolated for 1 h or 48 h in all four possible combinations
   revealed that copula duration depended strongly on the period of male
   but not of female sexual isolation, implying that this trait is under
   male control. Finally, if males mated once were re-paired after 1 h with
   either the same or a novel (but still recently mated) female, we found
   that they mated for significantly longer with the latter. Collectively,
   our results imply that male birch catkin bugs in nature are frequently
   time-, sperm- or seminal fluid-limited, and that, as predicted by

Abstract = {{The caste fate of developing female honey bee larvae is strictly
   socially regulated by adult nurse workers. As a result of this social
   regulation, nurse-expressed genes as well as larval-expressed genes may
   affect caste expression and evolution. We used a novel transcriptomic
   approach to identify genes with putative direct and indirect effects on
   honey bee caste development, and we subsequently studied the relative
   rates of molecular evolution at these caste-associated genes. We
   experimentally induced the production of new queens by removing the
   current colony queen, and we used RNA sequencing to study the gene
   expression profiles of both developing larvae and their caregiving
   nurses before and after queen removal. By comparing the gene expression
   profiles of queen-destined versus worker-destined larvae as well as
   nurses observed feeding these two types of larvae, we identified larval
   and nurse genes associated with caste development. Of 950 differentially
   expressed genes associated with caste, 82\% were expressed in larvae
   with putative direct effects on larval caste, and 18\% were expressed in
   nurses with putative indirect effects on caste. Estimated selection
   coefficients suggest that both nurse and larval genes putatively
   associated with caste are rapidly evolving, especially those genes
   associated with worker development. Altogether, our results suggest that
   indirect effect genes play important roles in both the expression and
   evolution of socially influenced traits such as caste.}},

Title = {{The genetics of intra- and interspecific competitive response and effect
   in a local population of an annual plant species}},

Abstract = {{1. While competition is recognized as a major factor responsible for
   plant community dynamics, the genetics of intra- and interspecific
   competitive ability of a target species (i.e. level of intra-population
   genetic variation, identity of phenotypic traits under selection and
   genetic bases) still deserves a deeper investigation at the local
   spatial scale by considering both numerous genotypes and several
   interacting species.
   2. In this study, we tested whether the genetics of competitive response
   and effect in Arabidopsis thaliana was dependent on the competitive
   environment at both the intraspecific and interspecific levels. We used
   a mapping population of 48 accessions (i) that maximize the genetic
   diversity of a local population of A.thaliana and (ii) that have been
   genotyped for 168503 single nucleotide polymorphisms.
   3. In a common garden experiment, those 48 accessions were grown in six
   competitive environments: the absence of competition, intraspecific
   competition and interspecific competition with four species frequently
   associated with A.thaliana in natural plant communities (i.e. Poa annua,
   Stellaria media, Trifolium repens and Veronica arvensis). A suite of
   nine phenotypic traits, including a proxy of fitness, were scored on
   each target A.thaliana plant and the above-ground dry biomass of its
   corresponding competitor was estimated.
   4. We first showed that crossing reaction norms of competitive response
   (A.thaliana performance) and effect (competitor biomass) might promote
   maintenance of genetic variation in a local population of A.thaliana and
   species coexistence at a fine spatial scale. By estimating genotypic
   gradients of selection, we then demonstrated that the optimal phenotypic
   strategies in response to competition depend on the identity of the
   competitor species. Finally, a genomewide association mapping approach
   highlighted that genomic regions associated with direct genetic effects
   were (i) dependent on the competitor species and (ii) different from
   genomic regions associated with interspecific indirect genetic effects.
   5. While a first step, this study highlighted the power of adding
   ecology to genomics in A.thaliana to identify genetic bases underlying
   micro-geographic adaptation to competition. Next-generation sequencing
   technologies will undoubtedly facilitate the discovery of molecular and
   genetic mechanisms underlying competitive ability in other plant
   species, and thereby the prediction of evolutionary trajectories of
   plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{Parents play a key role in determining the phenotype of their offspring.
   However, relatively few studies have investigated whether parents can
   change their offspring's behaviour in a sustained way that persists into
   adulthood. With experiments on the burying beetle, Nicrophorus
   vespilloides, we investigated how the developmental environment created
   by parents affects their offspring's wing morphology in adulthood, and
   the correlated effects on adult flight behaviour. Burying beetles
   exhibit complex biparental care, but offspring can survive without
   parental provisioning. By removing parents just prior to hatching, while
   holding the nutritional environment constant, we investigated the
   downstream consequences for offspring morphology and behaviour. Larvae
   that developed in the absence of their parents had relatively long and
   more slender wings than those that developed in their parents' presence.
   Flight mill tests revealed that flight performance was dependent on the
   presence of parents during development but not on wing shape. Our
   results demonstrate that parents have long-lasting effects on the
   behaviour of their offspring, by influencing the morphology and flight
   behaviour of their young even after they have matured into adults. (C)

Title = {{Predicting direct and indirect breeding values for survival time in
   laying hens using repeated measures}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Minimizing bird losses is important in the commercial layer
   industry. Selection against mortality is challenging because
   heritability is low, censoring is high, and individual survival depends
   on social interactions among cage members. With cannibalism, mortality
   depends not only on an individual's own genes (direct genetic effects;
   DGE) but also on genes of its cage mates (indirect genetic effects;
   IGE). To date, studies using DGE-IGE models have focussed on survival
   time but their shortcomings are that censored records were considered as
   exact lengths of life and models assumed that IGE were continuously
   expressed by all cage members even after death. However, since dead
   animals no longer express IGE, IGE should ideally be time-dependent in
   the model. Neglecting censoring and timing of IGE expression may reduce
   accuracy of estimated breeding values (EBV). Thus, our aim was to
   improve prediction of breeding values for survival time in layers that
   present cannibalism.
   Methods: We considered four DGE-IGE models to predict survival time in
   layers. One model was an analysis of survival time and the three others
   treated survival in consecutive months as a repeated binomial trait
   (repeated measures models). We also tested whether EBV were improved by
   including timing of IGE expression in the analyses. Approximate EBV
   accuracies were calculated by cross-validation. The models were fitted
   to survival data on two purebred White Leghorn layer lines W1 and WB,
   each having monthly survival records over 13 months.
   Results: Including the timing of IGE expression in the DGE-IGE model
   reduced EBV accuracy compared to analysing survival time. EBV accuracy
   was higher when repeated measures models were used. However, there was
   no universal best model. Using repeated measures instead of analysing
   survival time increased EBV accuracy by 10 to 21 and 2 to 12 \% for W1
   and WB, respectively. We showed how EBV and variance components
   estimated with repeated measures models can be translated into survival
   time.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that prediction of breeding values for
   survival time in laying hens can be improved using repeated measures
   models. This is an important result since more accurate EBV contribute
   to higher rates of genetic gain.}},

Title = {{A practical guide and power analysis for GLMMs: detecting among
   treatment variation in random effects}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP 17}},
Abstract = {{In ecology and evolution generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are
   becoming increasingly used to test for differences in variation by
   treatment at multiple hierarchical levels. Yet, the specific sampling
   schemes that optimize the power of an experiment to detect differences
   in random effects by treatment/group remain unknown. In this paper we
   develop a blueprint for conducting power analyses for GLMMs focusing on
   detecting differences in variance by treatment. We present
   parameterization and power analyses for random-intercepts and
   random-slopes GLMMs because of their generality as focal parameters for
   most applications and because of their immediate applicability to
   emerging questions in the field of behavioral ecology. We focus on the
   extreme case of hierarchically structured binomial data, though the
   framework presented here generalizes easily to any error distribution
   model. First, we determine the optimal ratio of individuals to repeated
   measures within individuals that maximizes power to detect differences
   by treatment in among-individual variation in intercept,
   among-individual variation in slope, and within-individual variation in
   intercept. Second, we explore how power to detect differences in target
   variance parameters is affected by total variation. Our results indicate
   heterogeneity in power across ratios of individuals to repeated measures
   with an optimal ratio determined by both the target variance parameter
   and total sample size. Additionally, power to detect each variance
   parameter was low overall (in most cases >1,000 total observations per
   treatment needed to achieve 80\% power) and decreased with increasing
   variance in non-target random effects. With growing interest in variance
   as the parameter of inquiry, these power analyses provide a crucial
   component for designing experiments focused on detecting differences in
   variance. We hope to inspire novel experimental designs in ecology and
   evolution investigating the causes and implications of individual-level
   phenotypic variance, such as the adaptive significance of
   within-individual variation.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypes vary hierarchically among taxa and populations, among
   genotypes within populations, among individuals within genotypes, and
   also within individuals for repeatedly expressed, labile phenotypic
   traits. This hierarchy produces some fundamental challenges to clearly
   defining biological phenomena and constructing a consistent explanatory
   framework. We use a heuristic statistical model to explore two
   consequences of this hierarchy. First, although the variation existing
   among individuals within populations has long been of interest to
   evolutionary biologists, within-individual variation has been much less
   emphasized. Within-individual variance occurs when labile phenotypes
   (behaviour, physiology, and sometimes morphology) exhibit phenotypic
   plasticity or deviate from a norm-of-reaction within the same
   individual. A statistical partitioning of phenotypic variance leads us
   to explore an array of ideas about residual within-individual variation.
   We use this approach to draw attention to additional processes that may
   influence within-individual phenotypic variance, including interactions
   among environmental factors, ecological effects on the fitness
   consequences of plasticity, and various types of adaptive variance.
   Second, our framework for investigating variation in phenotypic variance
   reveals that interactions between levels of the hierarchy form the
   preconditions for the evolution of all types of plasticity, and we
   extend this idea to the residual level within individuals, where both
   adaptive plasticity in residuals and canalization-like processes
   (stability) can evolve. With the statistical tools now available to
   examine heterogeneous residual variance, an array of novel questions
   linking phenotype to environment can be usefully addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Parasitic infection has a direct physiological cost to hosts but may
   also alter how hosts interact with other individuals in their
   environment. Such indirect effects may alter both host fitness and the
   fitness of other individuals in the host's social network, yet the
   relative impact of direct and indirect effects of infection are rarely
   quantified. During reproduction, a host's social environment includes
   family members who may be in conflict over resource allocation. In such
   situations, infection may alter how resources are allocated, thereby
   redistributing the costs of parasitism between individuals. Here, we
   experimentally reduce parasite burdens of parent and/or nestling
   European shags (Phalacrocorax aristotelis) infected with Contracaecum
   nematodes in a factorial design, then simultaneously measure the impact
   of an individual's infection on all family members. We found no direct
   effect of infection on parent or offspring traits but indirect effects
   were detected in all group members, with both immediate effects (mass
   change and survival) and longer-term effects (timing of parents'
   subsequent breeding). Our results show that parasite infection can have
   a major impact on individuals other than the host, suggesting that the
   effect of parasites on population processes may be greater than
   previously thought.}},

Title = {{Social genetic and social environment effects on parental and helper

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{282}},
Number = {{1810}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Phenotypes expressed in a social context are not only a function of the
   individual, but can also be shaped by the phenotypes of social partners.
   These social effects may play a major role in the evolution of
   cooperative breeding if social partners differ in the quality of care
   they provide and if individual carers adjust their effort in relation to
   that of other carers. When applying social effects models to wild study
   systems, it is also important to explore sources of individual
   plasticity that could masquerade as social effects. We studied offspring
   provisioning rates of parents and helpers in a wild population of
   long-tailed tits Aegithalos caudatus using a quantitative genetic
   framework to identify these social effects and partition them into
   genetic, permanent environment and current environment components.
   Controlling for other effects, individuals were consistent in their
   provisioning effort at a given nest, but adjusted their effort based on
   who was in their social group, indicating the presence of social
   effects. However, these social effects differed between years and social
   contexts, indicating a current environment effect, rather than
   indicating a genetic or permanent environment effect. While this study
   reveals the importance of examining environmental and genetic sources of
   social effects, the framework we present is entirely general, enabling a
   greater understanding of potentially important social effects within any
   ecological population.}},

Volume = {{69}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Males in polygamous mating systems may inadvertently transmit
   information regarding their mating preferences to bystanding sexual
   competitors, thereby permitting bystanders to use this information to
   enhance their own mating success by copying the mate choice of
   signallers. If males are at risk of having their mate choice copied and
   consequently face a higher risk of sexual competition, then selection
   should favour males that reduce conspicuous mating behaviours in the
   presence of an audience of sexual competitors. In the current study, we
   used the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a species that
   exhibits alternative male mating tactics, to test this sexual
   competition avoidance hypothesis and the predictions that males would
   decrease their overall mating effort and exhibit fewer conspicuous
   courtship displays relative to more inconspicuous sneak mating attempts
   in the presence of either one or two sexual rivals compared to the
   absence of any audience. Male guppies significantly reduced their
   overall mating effort in the presence of increasing numbers of rival
   audience males. This was reflected in similar monotonic decreases in the
   frequencies of courtship displays and sneak mating attempts and in the
   proportional use of courtship displays (relative to sneak mating
   attempts) across treatments. These findings are consistent with the
   sexual competition avoidance hypothesis. Our novel results contribute to
   an increasing body of knowledge showing that the social environment can
   influence the mating effort and mating decisions of individuals and thus
   have important implications for sexual selection and evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanisms that give rise to social structure is
   central to predicting the evolutionary and ecological outcomes of social
   interactions. Modeling this process is challenging, because all
   individuals simultaneously behave in ways that shape their social
   environments-a process called social niche construction (SNC). In
   earlier work, we demonstrated that aggression acts as an SNC trait in
   fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), but the mechanisms of that
   process remained cryptic. Here, we analyze how individual social group
   preferences generate overall social structure. We use a combination of
   agent-based simulation and approximate Bayesian computation to fit
   models to empirical data. We confirm that genetic variation in
   aggressive behavior influences social group structure. Furthermore, we
   find that female decamping due to male behavior may play an
   underappreciated role in structuring social groups. Male-male aggression
   may sometimes destabilize groups, but it may also be an SNC behavior for
   shaping desirable groups for females. Density intensifies female social
   preferences; thus, the role of female behavior in shaping group
   structure may become more important at high densities. Our ability to
   model the ontogeny of group structure demonstrates the utility of the
   Bayesian model-based approach in social behavioral studies.}},

Title = {{Indirect Genetic Effects and the Dynamics of Social Interactions}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one
   individual alter the expression of traits in social partners. Previous
   studies focused on the evolutionary consequences and evolutionary
   dynamics of IGEs, using equilibrium solutions to predict phenotypes in
   subsequent generations. However, whether or not such steady states may
   be reached may depend on the dynamics of interactions themselves.
   Results
   In our study, we focus on the dynamics of social interactions and
   indirect genetic effects and investigate how they modify phenotypes over
   time. Unlike previous IGE studies, we do not analyse evolutionary
   dynamics; rather we consider within-individual phenotypic changes, also
   referred to as phenotypic plasticity. We analyse iterative interactions,
   when individuals interact in a series of discontinuous events, and
   investigate the stability of steady state solutions and the dependence
   on model parameters, such as population size, strength, and the nature
   of interactions. We show that for interactions where a feedback loop
   occurs, the possible parameter space of interaction strength is fairly
   limited, affecting the evolutionary consequences of IGEs. We discuss the
   implications of our results for current IGE model predictions and their
   limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Parents of many species provision their young, and the extent of
   parental provisioning constitutes a major component of the offspring's
   social environment. Thus, a change in parental provisioning can alter
   selection on offspring, resulting in the coevolution of parental and
   offspring traits. Although this reasoning is central to our evolutionary
   understanding of family life, there is little direct evidence that
   selection by parents causes evolutionary change in their offspring. Here
   we use experimental evolution to examine how populations of burying
   beetles adapt to a change in posthatching parental provisioning. We
   measured the performance of larvae descended from lab populations that
   had been maintained with and without posthatching parental care (Full
   Care and No Care populations). We found that adaptation to the absence
   of posthatching care led to rapid and consistent changes in larval
   survival in the absence of care. Specifically, larvae from No Care
   populations had higher survival in the absence of care than larvae from
   Full Care populations. Other measures of larval performance, such as the
   ability of larvae to consume a breeding carcass and larval mass at
   dispersal, did not differ between the Full Care and No Care populations.
   Nevertheless, our results show that populations can adapt rapidly to a
   change in the extent of parental care and that experimental evolution
   can be used to study such adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Projected impacts of climate change on vector-borne disease dynamics
   must consider many variables relevant to hosts, vectors and pathogens,
   including how altered environmental characteristics might affect the
   spatial distributions of vector species. However, many predictive models
   for vector distributions consider their habitat requirements to be fixed
   over relevant time-scales, when they may actually be capable of rapid
   evolutionary change and even adaptation. We examine the genetic
   signature of a spatial expansion by an invasive vector into locations
   with novel temperature conditions compared to its native range as a
   proxy for how existing vector populations may respond to temporally
   changing habitat. Specifically, we compare invasions into different
   climate ranges and characterize the importance of selection from the
   invaded habitat. We demonstrate that vector species can exhibit
   evolutionary responses (altered allelic frequencies) to a temperature
   gradient in as little as 7-10 years even in the presence of high gene
   flow, and further, that this response varies depending on the strength
   of selection. We interpret these findings in the context of climate
   change predictions for vector populations and emphasize the importance
   of incorporating vector evolution into models of future vector-borne
   disease dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Populations from the same species may be differentiated across
   contrasting environments, potentially affecting reproductive isolation
   among them. When such populations meet in a novel common environment,
   this isolation may be modified by biotic or abiotic factors. Curiously,
   the latter have been overlooked. We filled this gap by performing
   experimental evolution of three replicates of two populations of
   Drosophila subobscura adapting to a common laboratorial environment, and
   simulated encounters at three time points during this process. Previous
   studies showed that these populations were highly differentiated for
   several life-history traits and chromosomal inversions. First, we show
   initial differentiation for some mating traits, such as assortative
   mating and male mating rate, but not others (e.g., female mating
   latency). Mating frequency increased during experimental evolution in
   both sets of populations. The assortative mating found in one population
   remained constant throughout the adaptation process, while
   disassortative mating of the other population diminished across
   generations. Additionally, differences in male mating rate were
   sustained across generations. This study shows that mating behavior
   evolves rapidly in response to adaptation to a common abiotic
   environment, although with a complex pattern that does not correspond to
   the quick convergence seen for life-history traits.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects influence the phenotype of offspring through
   non-genetic mechanisms, and thus are important components of individual
   life-histories and act as drivers of and/or constraints on phenotypic
   evolution. A maternal effect common in egg-laying vertebrates is
   provisioning of the yolk with carotenoids, organic pigments that often
   color sexual ornaments and are hypothesized to play positive and
   substantial physiological roles. In a recent study, yolks of great tit
   (Parus major) eggs were directly supplemented with carotenoids, and the
   effects on offspring fitness proxies measured (Marri and Richner in
   Oecologia 176:371-377, 2014a). Nestlings from supplemented broods were
   heavier early in development and more likely to fledge, but otherwise
   equivalent to control nestlings. The authors consider in detail the
   potential physiological mechanisms that might underlie this result, and
   here I expand on their Discussion by considering a non-exclusive
   explanation: that parents provided higher quality care to broods that
   received supplemental carotenoids. I discuss the general
   non-independence of pre- and post-hatching/parturition maternal effects
   when parents care for offspring, and then briefly review evidence that
   carotenoids specifically are tied to the intensity of avian begging
   displays. Finally, I detail how inclusive fitness opportunities and
   constraints shape the adaptive landscape in which maternal effects
   operate, highlighting both theoretical and applied concerns surrounding
   questions about the adaptiveness of maternal effects.}},

Abstract = {{The organization of individuals in social hierarchies is ubiquitous in
   social species. Although the evolution of dominance at the population
   level is constrained by its interactive character, selective breeding
   shows that dominance and subordination can be rapidly inherited. Genes
   involved in the expression of social dominance are starting to be
   identified. Evidence from behavioral genetics and genetic association
   studies points at a role for allelic variation in the dopamine and
   serotonin transporters, vasopressin receptor 1A, and the transcriptional
   regulator MECP2. The allelic frequency of the serotonin transporter was
   also linked to cultural differences in acceptance of social hierarchy
   values. Candidate genes for future association studies are imprinted
   genes and genes involved in energy metabolism recently identified in

Abstract = {{The social environment may be a key mediator of selection that operates
   on animals. In many cases, individuals may experience selection not only
   as a function of their phenotype, but also as a function of the
   interaction between their phenotype and the phenotypes of the
   conspecifics they associate with. For example, when animals settle after
   dispersal, individuals may benefit from arriving early, but, in many
   cases, these benefits will be affected by the arrival times of other
   individuals in their local environment. We integrated a recently
   described method for calculating assortativity on weighted networks,
   which is the correlation between an individual's phenotype and that of
   its associates, into an existing framework for measuring the magnitude
   of social selection operating on phenotypes. We applied this approach to
   large-scale data on social network structure and the timing of arrival
   into the breeding area over three years. We found that late-arriving
   individuals had a reduced probability of breeding. However, the
   probability of breeding was also influenced by individuals' social
   networks. Associating with late-arriving conspecifics increased the
   probability of successfully acquiring a breeding territory. Hence,
   social selection could offset the effects of nonsocial selection. Given
   parallel theoretical developments of the importance of local network
   structure on population processes, and increasing data being collected
   on social networks in free-living populations, the integration of these
   concepts could yield significant insights into social evolution.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{602-610}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Sexual selection acting on small initial differences in mating signals
   and mate preferences can enhance signal-preference codivergence and
   reproductive isolation during speciation. However, the origin of initial
   differences in sexual traits remains unclear. We asked whether biotic
   environments, a source of variation in sexual traits, may provide a
   general solution to this problem. Specifically, we asked whether genetic
   variation in biotic environments provided by host plants can result in
   signal-preference phenotypic covariance in a host-specific,
   plant-feeding insect. We used a member of the Enchenopa binotata species
   complex of treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to assess patterns of
   variation in male mating signals and female mate preferences induced by
   genetic variation in host plants. We employed a novel implementation of
   a quantitative genetics method, rearing field-collected treehoppers on a
   sample of naturally occurring replicated host plant clone lines. We
   found remarkably high signal-preference covariance among host plant
   genotypes. Thus, genetic variation in biotic environments influences the
   sexual phenotypes of organisms living on those environments in a way
   that promotes assortative mating among environments. This consequence
   arises from conditions likely to be common in nature (phenotypic
   plasticity and variation in biotic environments). It therefore offers a
   general answer to how divergent sexual selection may begin.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural ecologists increasingly study behavioural variation within
   and among individuals in conjunction, thereby integrating research on
   phenotypic plasticity and animal personality within a single adaptive
   framework. Interactions between individuals (cf. social environments)
   constitute a major causative factor of behavioural variation at both of
   these hierarchical levels. Social interactions give rise to complex
   `interactive phenotypes' and group-level emergent properties. This type
   of phenotype has intriguing evolutionary implications, warranting a
   cohesive framework for its study. We detail here how a reaction-norm

Abstract = {{Males can through their behavior (e.g., courtship feeding) exert an
   indirect effect on their partner's reproductive traits, such as the
   seasonal timing and size of her clutch. Evidence for such indirect
   (male) effect on reproduction is starting to accumulate. We quantify
   female and male effects on reproduction in the tawny owl Strix aluco
   using a hierarchical mixed model on data collected in 1978-2013. We find
   that differences between males explain 7 \% of the phenotypic variance
   in laying date (females 5 \%). In contrast, females have a clear (11 \%)
   effect on clutch size, whereas males have no effect. Based on
   multivariate hierarchical modeling, we find an individual-level
   correlation between the male-specific effect on laying date and his body
   mass (but not his plumage color or wing length). Heavy males may be able
   to affect their partner's seasonal timing of laying because of an
   advantage in providing courtship feeding prior to reproduction. Our
   findings illustrate that males can be an important determinant of
   variation in reproduction and that multivariate mixed models present a
   general approach to pinpoint which individual characteristics could be
   associated with such indirect effects.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of the genetic basis and evolution of complex social behavior
   emphasize either conserved or novel genes. To begin to reconcile these
   perspectives, we studied how the evolutionary conservation of genes
   associated with social behavior depends on regulatory context, and
   whether genes associated with social behavior exist in distinct
   regulatory and evolutionary contexts. We identified modules of
   co-expressed genes associated with age-based division of labor between
   nurses and foragers in the ant Monomorium pharaonis, and we studied the
   relationship between molecular evolution, connectivity, and expression.
   Highly connected and expressed genes were more evolutionarily conserved,
   as expected. However, compared to the rest of the genome,
   forager-upregulated genes were much more highly connected and conserved,
   while nurse-upregulated genes were less connected and more
   evolutionarily labile. Our results indicate that the genetic
   architecture of social behavior includes both highly connected and
   conserved components as well as loosely connected and evolutionarily
   labile components.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to estimate covariance components for BW at
   270 d (BW270) and carcass and ham quality traits in heavy pigs using
   models accounting for social effects and to compare the ability of such
   models to fit the data relative to models ignoring social interactions.
   Phenotypic records were from 9,871 pigs sired by 293 purebred boars
   mated to 456 crossbred sows. Piglets were born and reared at the same
   farm and randomly assigned at 60 d of age to groups (6.1 pigs per group
   on average) housed in finishing pens, each having an area of 6 m(2). The
   average additive genetic relationship among group mates was 0.11. Pigs
   were slaughtered at 277 +/- 3 d of age and 169.7 +/- 13.9 kg BW in
   groups of nearly 70 animals each. Four univariate animal models were
   compared: a basic model (M1) including only direct additive genetic
   effects, a model (M2) with nonheritable social group (pen) effects in
   addition to effects in M1, a model (M3) accounting for litter effects in
   addition to M2, and a model (M4) accounting for social genetic effects
   in addition to effects in M3. Restricted maximum likelihood estimates of
   covariance components were obtained for BW270; carcass backfat depth;
   carcass lean meat content (CLM); iodine number (IOD); and linoleic acid
   content (LIA) of raw ham subcutaneous fat; subcutaneous fat depth in the
   proximity of semimembranosus muscle (SFD1) and quadriceps femoris muscle
   (SFD2); and linear scores for ham round shape (RS), subcutaneous fat
   (SF), and marbling. Likelihood ratio tests indicated that, for all
   traits, M2 fit the data better than M1 and that M3 was superior to M2
   except for SFD1 and SFD2. Model M4 was significantly better than M3 for
   BW270 (P < 0.001) and CLM, IOD, RS, and SF (P < 0.05). The contribution
   of social genetic effects to the total heritable variance was large for
   CLM and BW270, ranging from 33.2 to 35\%, whereas the one for ham
   quality traits ranged from 6.8 (RS) to 11.2\% (SF). Direct and social
   genetic effects on BW270 were uncorrelated, whereas there was a negative
   genetic covariance between direct and social effects on CLM, IOD, RS,
   and SF, which reduced the total heritable variance. This variance,
   measured relative to phenotypic variance, ranged from 21 (CLM) to 54\%
   (BW270). Results indicate that social genetic effects affect variation
   in traits relevant for heavy pigs used in dry-cured hams manufacturing.
   Such effects should be exploited and taken into account in design of
   breeding programs for heavy pigs.}},

   High IGEg pigs showed from 8 to 23 weeks age 40 \% less aggressive

Abstract = {{The social complexity that characterizes the eusocial insects strongly
   affects all aspects of social insect life, including the molecular and
   evolutionary genetic basis of social insect traits. Quantitative genetic
   theory and empirical approaches have been developed over the past 60
   years specifically to study the genetic implications of social
   interactions. Surprisingly, given the obvious biological importance of
   social interactions in social insects, this research tradition has been
   and continues to be widely overlooked throughout the social insect
   literature, including in recent sociogenomic studies focused on
   understanding the molecular underpinnings of social life. Instead, the
   overwhelming majority of social insect genetic research has relied on
   conventional genetic approaches developed for solitary organisms focused
   on the one-to-one association of an individual's genes to its own
   traits. I survey social insect studies that conclusively demonstrate the
   importance of indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which arise from social
   interactions, for social insect trait expression and evolution. I
   explain why these genetically based social effects are expected to be
   ubiquitous in social insects and I explain the relevance of the IGE
   framework, originally developed within quantitative genetics, for
   molecular genetic studies of social insect traits such as behaviour and
   caste. I discuss the problems of ignoring IGEs and relying solely on
   conventional direct genetic effect approaches. Finally, I discuss the
   strong potential of using the IGE approach and other more
   systems-level-focused approaches to complement conventional reductionist
   approaches in elucidating the genetic basis of social insect trait
   expression and evolution.}},

Title = {{An evolutionary perspective on conflict and compensation in

Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{755-767}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Physiological and functional traits, especially those related to
   behavior and whole-organism performance capacities, are subject to a
   variety of both parallel and opposing natural and sexual selection
   pressures. These selection pressures show considerable interspecific
   variation, shaping contemporary behavioral and functional diversity, but
   the form and intensity of selection on physiological and functional
   traits can also vary intraspecifically. The same suites of traits can
   experience quite different selection pressures, depending on the sex or
   age of a given individual, as well as the presence and nature of
   alternative reproductive strategies and tactics. These inter-and
   intra-locus genetic conflicts have potentially important consequences
   for the evolutionary trajectories of traits subject to them.
   Consequently, any intraspecific conflicts which could displace traits
   from their selective optima in certain classes of individuals relative
   to others are expected to result in selection for mechanisms to
   compensate for deviation from those optima. Such conflicts include
   interlocus sexual conflict, intralocus sexual conflict, and interacting
   phenotypes, as well as conflict within a sex. In this paper, we consider
   the evidence for, and implications of, such conflicts for physiological
   and functional traits in diverse taxa, including both vertebrates and
   invertebrates, and evaluate the various mechanisms, ranging from
   behavioral and mechanical to energetic and genetic, enabling
   compensation. We also discuss how pre- and post-mating conflicts, as
   well as interacting phenotypes, might affect the evolution of behavior
   and physiological and functional traits. Investigators that seek to
   understand the links among behavior, morphology, physiology, and
   function should consider such conflicts.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Social interactions between individuals living in a group can have both
   positive and negative effects on welfare, productivity, and health of
   these individuals. Negative effects of social interactions in livestock
   are easier to observe than positive effects. For example, laying hens
   may develop feather pecking, which can cause mortality due to
   cannibalism, and pigs may develop tail biting or excessive aggression.
   Several studies have shown that social interactions affect the genetic
   variation in a trait. Genetic improvement of socially-affected traits,
   however, has proven to be difficult until relatively recently. The use
   of classical selection methods, like individual selection, may result in
   selection responses opposite to expected, because these methods neglect
   the effect of an individual on its group mates (social genetic effects).
   It has become clear that improvement of socially-affected traits
   requires selection methods that take into account not only the direct
   effect of an individual on its own phenotype but also the social genetic
   effects, also known as indirect genetic effects, of an individual on the
   phenotypes of its group mates. Here, we review the theoretical and
   empirical work on social genetic effects, with a focus on livestock.
   First, we present the theory of social genetic effects. Subsequently, we
   evaluate the evidence for social genetic effects in livestock and other
   species, by reviewing estimates of genetic parameters for direct and
   social genetic effects. Then we describe the results of different
   selection experiments. Finally, we discuss issues concerning the
   implementation of social genetic effects in livestock breeding programs.
   This review demonstrates that selection for socially-affected traits,
   using methods that target both the direct and social genetic effects, is
   a promising, but sometimes difficult to use in practice, tool to
   simultaneously improve production and welfare in livestock.}},

Title = {{Estimates of direct and indirect effects for early juvenile survival in

Abstract = {{Together with the avoidance of any negative impact of inbreeding,
   preservation of genetic variability for life-history traits that could
   undergo future selective pressure is a major issue in endangered species
   management programmes. However, most of these programmes ignore that,
   apart from the direct action of genes on such traits, parents, as
   contributors of offspring environment, can influence offspring
   performance through indirect parental effects (when parental genotype
   and phenotype exerts environmental influences on offspring phenotype
   independently of additive genetic effects). Using quantitative genetic
   models, we estimated the additive genetic variance for juvenile survival
   in a population of the endangered Cuvier's gazelle kept in captivity
   since 1975. The dataset analyzed included performance recording for 700
   calves and a total pedigree of 740 individuals. Results indicated that
   in this population juvenile survival harbors significant additive
   genetic variance. The estimates of heritability obtained were in general
   moderate (0.115-0.457) and not affected by the inclusion of inbreeding
   in the models. Maternal genetic contribution to juvenile survival seems
   to be of major importance in this gazelle's population as well. Indirect
   genetic and indirect environmental effects assigned to mothers (i.e.,
   maternal genetic and maternal permanent environmental effects) roughly
   explain a quarter of the total variance estimated for the trait
   analyzed. These findings have major evolutionary consequences for the
   species as show that offspring phenotypes can evolve strictly through
   changes in the environment provided by mothers. They are also relevant
   for the captive breeding programme of the species. To take into account,
   the contribution that mothers have on offspring phenotype through
   indirect genetic effects when designing pairing strategies might serve
   to identify those females with better ability to recruit, and,
   additionally, to predict reliable responses to selection in the captive
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Populations evolve in response to the external environment, whether
   abiotic (e. g., climate) or biotic (e. g., other conspecifics). We
   investigated how adaptation to biotic, heritable environments differs
   from adaptation to abiotic, nonheritable environments. We found that,
   for the same selection coefficients, the coadaptive process between
   genes and heritable environments is much faster than genetic adaptation
   to an abiotic nonheritable environment. The increased rate of adaptation
   results from the positive association generated by reciprocal selection
   between the heritable environment and the genes responding to it. These
   associations result in a runaway process of adaptive coevolution, even
   when the genes creating the heritable environment and genes responding
   to the heritable environment are unlinked. Although tightening the
   degree of linkage accelerates the coadaptive process, the acceleration
   caused by a comparable amount of inbreeding is greater, because
   inbreeding has a cumulative effect on reducing functional recombination
   over generations. Our results suggest that that adaptation to local
   abiotic environmental variation may result in the rapid diversification
   of populations and subsequent reproductive isolation not directly but
   rather via its effects on heritable environments and the genes
   responding to them.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{184}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{489-499}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Many species spend their lives in close association with other
   organisms, and the environments provided by those organisms can play an
   important role as causes of variation in phenotypes. When this is the
   case, the genotypes of the individuals constituting the environment may
   influence the phenotypes of individuals living in that environment. When
   these effects are between heterospecifics, interspecific indirect
   genetic effects (IIGEs) occur. Several studies have detected IIGEs, but
   whether IIGEs contribute to variation in sexually selected traits
   remains virtually unexplored. We assessed how mate preferences in a
   plant-feeding insect are influenced by the genotype of their host plant.
   We established clone lines of a sample of host plant genotypes
   constituting the background biotic environment for a random sample of
   insects that we reared on them. We found that the insects' mate
   preferences varied according to the clone line on which they developed.
   These results demonstrate that genetic variation in host plants has
   cross-trophic consequences on a trait that has strong effects on fitness
   and interpopulation dynamics such as diversification in communication
   systems. We discuss how IIGEs on mate preferences may influence the way
   in which selection acts, including the maintenance of variation and the
   promotion of evolutionary divergence.}},

Journal = {{HEREDITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{364-374}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Infectious diseases have a major role in evolution by natural selection
   and pose a worldwide concern in livestock. Understanding quantitative
   genetics of infectious diseases, therefore, is essential both for
   understanding the consequences of natural selection and for designing
   artificial selection schemes in agriculture. The basic reproduction
   ratio, R-0, is the key parameter determining risk and severity of
   infectious diseases. Genetic improvement for control of infectious
   diseases in host populations should therefore aim at reducing R-0. This
   requires definitions of breeding value and heritable variation for R-0,
   and understanding of mechanisms determining response to selection. This
   is challenging, as R-0 is an emergent trait arising from interactions
   among individuals in the population. Here we show how to define breeding
   value and heritable variation for R-0 for genetically heterogeneous host
   populations. Furthermore, we identify mechanisms determining utilization
   of heritable variation for R-0. Using indirect genetic effects,
   next-generation matrices and a SIR (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered)
   model, we show that an individual's breeding value for R-0 is a function
   of its own allele frequencies for susceptibility and infectivity and of
   population average susceptibility and infectivity. When interacting
   individuals are unrelated, selection for individual disease status
   captures heritable variation in susceptibility only, yielding limited
   response in R-0. With related individuals, however, there is a secondary
   selection process, which also captures heritable variation in
   infectivity and additional variation in susceptibility, yielding
   substantially greater response. This shows that genetic variation in
   susceptibility represents an indirect genetic effect. As a consequence,
   response in R-0 increased substantially when interacting individuals
   were genetically related.}},

Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{855-862}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{It is well established that interactions between conspecifics are often
   influenced by the presence of passive bystanders. Individuals have been
   found to alter their behavior in a variety of contexts, from foraging to
   aggression, based on the presence, sex, or identity of an audience. This
   audience effect may influence not only the nature of a signaling event
   but also the evolution of signal structure as signals may have to convey
   information across a distance. Additionally, audience individuals may
   use information obtained by watching in later encounters with these
   individuals, which may act as a selection pressure on communication.
   Communication networks in Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, are
   particularly well studied, with audience effects influencing both
   male-male interactions and male-female interactions. However, the
   effects of an audience on female-female interactions have not been
   examined in this species or any other. This study examined the
   interactions of pairs of females in three different audience conditions
   (male, female, and no audience). The results suggest that female-female
   interactions are affected by the presence of an audience as
   interactant-directed gill flaring, the most commonly performed behavior,
   was performed more with an audience present. Additionally, the sex of
   the audience seemed to be influential, reflected by a difference in the
   frequency of interactant-directed behaviors when a female vs. a male
   audience was present. This study is one of the first to demonstrate that
   females modify their behavior as a result of being watched and stresses
   the importance of examining audience effects in a variety of social
   contexts.}},

Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{Recent years have seen increasing interest in indirect genetic effects,
   i.e. influences on the phenotype that depend on the genotype of other
   conspecific individuals; however, the empirical evidence for such
   effects is still limited, especially in wild plant species. The present
   study of the clonal herb Sedum album assessed direct and indirect
   genetic effects on performance-related traits in a 4-year experiment
   with clonally replicated genotypes, grown in pairs and differing in
   anthocyanin pigmentation to allow separation of individuals during data
   collection. In agreement with the existence of indirect genetic effects,
   the experimentally-paired plants not only expressed their own genotype
   but were also affected by the genotype of their pair mate. The effect of
   neighbour genotype explained up to one-fourth of the variation in
   performance and most likely resulted from competition, imposed by the
   close physical contact between paired individuals and the limiting
   conditions used in the garden environment. Indirect genetic effects from
   competition have the potential to enhance the efficacy of group-level
   selection relative to individual selection, given the nutrient-poor and
   spatially-confined substrate available to plants of S. album in the
   natural habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Parenting behaviors, such as the provisioning of food by parents to
   offspring, are known to be highly responsive to changes in environment.
   However, we currently know little about how such flexibility affects the
   ways in which parenting is adapted and evolves in response to
   environmental variation. This is because few studies quantify how
   individuals vary in their response to changing environments, especially
   social environments created by other individuals with which parents
   interact. Social environmental factors differ from nonsocial factors,
   such as food availability, because parents and offspring both contribute
   and respond to the social environment they experience. This
   interdependence leads to the coevolution of flexible behaviors involved
   in parenting, which could, paradoxically, constrain the ability of
   individuals to rapidly adapt to changes in their nonsocial environment.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3139-3145}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Transgenerational effects are broader than only parental relationships.
   Despite mounting evidence that multigenerational effects alter
   phenotypic and life-history traits, our understanding of how they
   combine to determine fitness is not well developed because of the added
   complexity necessary to study them. Here, we derive a quantitative
   genetic model of adaptation to an extraordinary new environment by an
   additive genetic component, phenotypic plasticity, maternal and
   grandmaternal effects. We show how, at equilibrium, negative maternal
   and negative grandmaternal effects maximize expected population mean
   fitness. We define negative transgenerational effects as those that have
   a negative effect on trait expression in the subsequent generation, that
   is, they slow, or potentially reverse, the expected evolutionary
   dynamic. When maternal effects are positive, negative grandmaternal
   effects are preferred. As expected under Mendelian inheritance, the
   grandmaternal effects have a lower impact on fitness than the maternal
   effects, but this dual inheritance model predicts a more complex
   relationship between maternal and grandmaternal effects to constrain
   phenotypic variance and so maximize expected population mean fitness in
   the offspring.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Many organisms live in populations structured by space and by class,
   exhibit plastic responses to their social partners, and are subject to
   nonadditive ecological and fitness effects. Social evolution theory has
   long recognized that all of these factors can lead to different
   selection pressures but has only recently attempted to synthesize how
   these factors interact. Using models for both discrete and continuous
   phenotypes, we show that analyzing these factors in a consistent
   framework reveals that they interact with one another in ways previously
   overlooked. Specifically, behavioral responses (reciprocity), genetic
   relatedness, and synergy interact in nontrivial ways that cannot be
   easily captured by simple summary indices of assortment. We demonstrate
   the importance of these interactions by showing how they have been
   neglected in previous synthetic models of social behavior both within
   and between species. These interactions also affect the level of
   behavioral responses that can evolve in the long run; proximate
   biological mechanisms are evolutionarily stable when they generate
   enough responsiveness relative to the level of responsiveness that
   exactly balances the ecological costs and benefits. Given the richness
   of social behavior across taxa, these interactions should be a boon for
   empirical research as they are likely crucial for describing the complex
   relationship linking ecology, demography, and social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The epigenetic phenomenon of genomic imprinting has motivated the
   development of numerous theories for its evolutionary origins and
   genomic distribution. In this review, we examine the three theories that
   have best withstood theoretical and empirical scrutiny. These are: Haig
   and colleagues' kinship theory; Day and Bonduriansky's sexual antagonism
   theory; and Wolf and Hager's maternal-offspring coadaptation theory.
   These theories have fundamentally different perspectives on the adaptive
   significance of imprinting. The kinship theory views imprinting as a
   mechanism to change gene dosage, with imprinting evolving because of the
   differential effect that gene dosage has on the fitness of matrilineal
   and patrilineal relatives. The sexual antagonism and maternal-offspring
   coadaptation theories view genomic imprinting as a mechanism to modify
   the resemblance of an individual to its two parents, with imprinting
   evolving to increase the probability of expressing the fitter of the two
   alleles at a locus. In an effort to stimulate further empirical work on
   the topic, we carefully detail the logic and assumptions of all three
   theories, clarify the specific predictions of each and suggest tests to
   discriminate between these alternative theories for why particular genes
   are imprinted.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one
   individual alter the phenotype of an interacting partner. IGEs can
   dramatically affect the expression and evolution of social traits.
   However, the interacting phenotype(s) through which they are transmitted
   are often unknown, or cryptic, and their detection would enhance our
   ability to accurately predict evolutionary change. To illustrate this
   challenge and possible solutions to it, we assayed male leg-tapping
   behavior using inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster paired with a
   common focal male strain. The expression of tapping in focal males was
   dependent on the genotype of their interacting partner, but this strong
   IGE was cryptic. Using a multiple-regression approach, we identified
   male startle response as a candidate interacting phenotype: the longer
   it took interacting males to settle after being startled, the less focal
   males tapped them. A genome-wide association analysis identified
   approximately a dozen candidate protein-coding genes potentially
   underlying the IGE, of which the most significant was slowpoke. Our
   methodological framework provides information about candidate phenotypes
   and candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms that underpin a strong yet
   cryptic IGE. We discuss how this approach can facilitate the detection
   of cryptic IGEs contributing to unusual evolutionary dynamics in other
   study systems.}},

Abstract = {{According to classical parental care theory males are expected to
   provide less parental care when offspring in a brood are less likely to
   be their own, but empirical evidence in support of this relationship is
   equivocal. Recent work predicts that social interactions between the
   sexes can modify co-evolution between traits involved in mating and
   parental care as a result of costs associated with these social
   interactions (i.e. sexual conflict). In burying beetles (Nicrophorus
   vespilloides), we use artificial selection on a paternity assurance
   trait, and crosses within and between selection lines, to show that
   selection acting on females, not males, can drive the co-evolution of
   paternity assurance traits and parental care. Males do not care more in
   response to selection on mating rate. Instead, patterns of parental care
   change as an indirect response to costs of mating for females.}},

Abstract = {{Good early nutritional conditions may confer a lasting fitness advantage
   over individuals suffering poor early conditions (a `silver spoon'
   effect). Alternatively, if early conditions predict the likely adult
   environment, adaptive plastic responses might maximize individual
   performance when developmental and adult conditions match
   (environmental-matching effect). Here, we test for silver spoon and
   environmental-matching effects by manipulating the early nutritional
   environment of Nicrophorus vespilloides burying beetles. We manipulated
   nutrition during two specific early developmental windows: the larval
   environment and the post-eclosion environment. We then tested contest
   success in relation to variation in adult social environmental quality
   experienced (defined according to whether contest opponents were smaller
   (good environment) or larger (poor environment) than the focal
   individual). Variation in the larval environment influenced adult body
   size but not contest success per se for a given adult social environment
   experienced (an `indirect' silver spoon effect). Variation in
   post-eclosion environment affected contest success dependent on the
   quality of the adult environment experienced (a context-dependent
   `direct' silver spoon effect). By contrast, there was no evidence for
   environmental-matching. The results demonstrate the importance of social
   environmental context in determining how variation in nutrition in early
   life affects success as an adult.}},

Abstract = {{Early family life is characterized by a close interaction between
   parents and their offspring. This needs to be disentangled when studying
   the ontogeny and evolution of a given behavior-e.g. via cross-fostering.
   But cross-fostering may change the expression of parent and offspring
   behaviors as they may respond to the novel environment. Furthermore,
   parent and offspring traits are potentially co-adjusted and
   cross-fostering may, therefore, introduce a costly mismatch. To study
   such consequences of cross-fostering, we created an experimental group
   (EG) of broods raised by foster parents from day 3 onwards and a control
   group of broods raised by their biological parents throughout. We tested
   offspring begging intensity in all broods and the provisioning of the
   EG-parents only, both on day 3 just before cross-fostering and then
   again on day 5. Costs were estimated in terms of growth and survival
   (offspring costs) and mass of a second clutch (parental costs).
   Offspring begging intensity varied with age, but this change was neither
   affected by cross-fostering per se nor by small-scale differences in
   parental provisioning between biological and foster parents. Similarly,
   the change in parental provisioning with offspring age among the
   EG-parents was not affected by the difference in begging between
   biological and foster nestlings. This lack in behavioral plasticity in
   response to cross-fostering did not entail costs to neither of the
   parties. Our results suggest a rather predetermined pattern of
   behavioral expression, which may be shaped by limits and costs to
   plasticity and/or an (apparent) lack of costs of a behavioral mismatch.}},

Abstract = {{Many reproductive traits that have evolved under sexual conflict may be
   influenced by both sexes. Investigation of the genetic architecture of
   such traits can yield important insight into their evolution, but this
   entails that the heritable component of variation is estimated for males
   and femalesas an interacting phenotype. We address the lack of research
   in this area through an investigation of egg production and copula
   duration in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Despite egg
   production rate being determined by both sexes, which may cause sexual
   conflict, an assessment of this trait as an interacting phenotype is
   lacking. It is currently unclear whether copula duration is determined
   by males and/or females. We found significant female, but not male,
   genetic variance for egg production rate that may indicate reduced
   potential for ongoing sexually antagonistic coevolution. In contrast,
   copula duration was determined by significant genetic variance in both
   sexes. We also identified genetic variation in egg retention among
   virgin females. Although previously identified in wild populations, it
   is unclear why this should be present in a laboratory stock. This study
   provides a novel insight into the shared genetic architecture of
   reproductive traits that are the subject of sexual conflict.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypes are often environmentally dependent, which requires organisms
   to track environmental change. The challenge for organisms is to
   construct phenotypes using the most accurate environmental cue.
   Here, we use a quantitative genetic model of adaptation by additive
   genetic variance, within- and transgenerational plasticity via linear
   reaction norms and indirect genetic effects respectively.
   We show how the relative influence on the eventual phenotype of these
   components depends on the predictability of environmental change (fast
   or slow, sinusoidal or stochastic) and the developmental lag tau between
   when the environment is perceived and when selection acts.
   We then decompose expected mean fitness into three components (variance
   load, adaptation and fluctuation load) to study the fitness costs of
   within- and transgenerational plasticity. A strongly negative maternal
   effect coefficient m minimizes the variance load, but a strongly
   positive m minimises the fluctuation load. The adaptation term is
   maximized closer to zero, with positive or negative m preferred under
   different environmental scenarios.
   Phenotypic plasticity is higher when tau is shorter and when the
   environment changes frequently between seasonal extremes. Expected mean
   population fitness is highest away from highest observed levels of
   phenotypic plasticity.
   Within- and transgenerational plasticity act in concert to deliver
   well-adapted phenotypes, which emphasizes the need to study both
   simultaneously when investigating phenotypic evolution.}},

Title = {{Plumage condition in laying hens: genetic parameters for direct and
   indirect effects in two purebred layer lines}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Feather pecking is a major welfare issue in laying hen
   industry that leads to mortality. Due to a ban on conventional cages in
   the EU and on beak trimming in some countries of the EU, feather pecking
   will become an even bigger problem. Its severity depends both on the
   victim receiving pecking and on its group mates inflicting pecking
   (indirect effects), which together determine plumage condition of the
   victim. Plumage condition may depend, therefore, on both the direct
   genetic effect of an individual itself and on the indirect genetic
   effects of its group mates. Here, we present estimated genetic
   parameters for direct and indirect effects on plumage condition of
   different body regions in two purebred layer lines, and estimates of
   genetic correlations between body regions.
   Methods: Feather condition scores (FCS) were recorded at 40 weeks of age
   for neck, back, rump and belly and these four scores were added-up into
   a total FCS. A classical animal model and a direct-indirect effects
   model were used to estimate genetic parameters for FCS. In addition, a
   bivariate model with mortality (0/ 1) was used to account for mortality
   before recording FCS. Due to mortality during the first 23 weeks of
   laying, 5363 (for W1) and 5089 (for WB) FCS records were available.
   Results: Total heritable variance for FCS ranged from 1.5\% to 9.8\% and
   from 9.8\% to 53.6\% when estimated respectively with the classical
   animal and the direct-indirect effects model. The direct-indirect
   effects model had a significantly higher likelihood. In both lines, 70\%
   to 94\% of the estimated total heritable variation in FCS was due to
   indirect effects. Using bivariate analysis of FCS and mortality did not
   affect estimates of genetic parameters. Genetic correlations were high
   between adjacent regions for FCS on neck, back, and rump but moderate to
   low for belly with other regions.
   Conclusion: Our results show that 70\% to 94\% of the heritable
   variation in FCS relates to indirect effects, indicating that methods of
   genetic selection that include indirect genetic effects offer
   perspectives to improve plumage condition in laying hens. This, in turn
   could reduce a major welfare problem.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple organisms can sometimes affect a common phenotype. For example,
   the portion of a leaf eaten by an insect is a joint phenotype of the
   plant and insect and the amount of food obtained by an offspring can be

   phenotypes in quantitative genetic terms. A joint phenotype for multiple
   species evolves as the sum of additive genetic variances in each
   species, weighted by the selection on each species. Selective conflict
   between the interactants occurs when selection takes opposite signs on
   the joint phenotype. The mean fitness of a population changes not just
   through its own genetic variance but also through the genetic variance
   for its fitness that resides in other species, an update of Fisher's
   fundamental theorem of natural selection. Some similar results, using
   inclusive fitness, apply to within-species interactions. The models

Abstract = {{Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness revolutionized our understanding
   of the evolution of social interactions. Surprisingly, an incorporation
   of Hamilton's perspective into the quantitative genetic theory of
   phenotypic evolution has been slow, despite the popularity of
   quantitative genetics in evolutionary studies. Here, we discuss several
   versions of Hamilton's rule for social evolution from a quantitative
   genetic perspective, emphasizing its utility in empirical applications.
   Although evolutionary quantitative genetics offers methods to measure
   each of the critical parameters of Hamilton's rule, empirical work has
   lagged behind theory. In particular, we lack studies of selection on
   altruistic traits in the wild. Fitness costs and benefits of altruism
   can be estimated using a simple extension of phenotypic selection
   analysis that incorporates the traits of social interactants. We also
   discuss the importance of considering the genetic influence of the
   social environment, or indirect genetic effects (IGEs), in the context
   of Hamilton's rule. Research in social evolution has generated an
   extensive body of empirical work focusing-with good reason-almost solely
   on relatedness. We argue that quantifying the roles of social and
   non-social components of selection and IGEs, in addition to relatedness,
   is now timely and should provide unique additional insights into social
   evolution.}},

Title = {{Indirect genetic effects contribute substantially to heritable variation
   in aggression-related traits in group-housed mink (Neovison vison)}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Since the recommendations on group housing of mink (Neovison
   vison) were adopted by the Council of Europe in 1999, it has become
   common in mink production in Europe. Group housing is advantageous from
   a production perspective, but can lead to aggression between animals and
   thus raises a welfare issue. Bite marks on the animals are an indicator
   of this aggressive behaviour and thus selection against frequency of
   bite marks should reduce aggression and improve animal welfare. Bite
   marks on one individual reflect the aggression of its group members,
   which means that the number of bite marks carried by one individual
   depends on the behaviour of other individuals and that it may have a
   genetic basis. Thus, for a successful breeding strategy it could be
   crucial to consider both direct (DGE) and indirect (IGE) genetic effects
   on this trait. However, to date no study has investigated the genetic
   basis of bite marks in mink.
   Result and discussion: A model that included DGE and IGE fitted the data
   significantly better than a model with DGE only, and IGE contributed a
   substantial proportion of the heritable variation available for response
   to selection. In the model with IGE, the total heritable variation
   expressed as the proportion of phenotypic variance (T-2) was six times
   greater than classical heritability (h(2)). For instance, for total bite
   marks, T-2 was equal to 0.61, while h(2) was equal to 0.10. The genetic
   correlation between direct and indirect effects ranged from 0.55 for
   neck bite marks to 0.99 for tail bite marks. This positive correlation
   suggests that mink have a tendency to fight in a reciprocal way (giving
   and receiving bites) and thus, a genotype that confers a tendency to
   bite other individuals can also cause its bearer to receive more bites.
   Conclusion: Both direct and indirect genetic effects contribute to
   variation in number of bite marks in group-housed mink. Thus, a genetic
   selection design that includes both direct genetic and indirect genetic
   effects could reduce the frequency of bite marks and probably aggression
   behaviour in group-housed mink.}},

Title = {{Hemiclonal analysis of interacting phenotypes in male and female
   Drosophila melanogaster}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAY 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Identifying the sources of variation in mating interactions
   between males and females is important because this variation influences
   the strength and/or the direction of sexual selection that populations
   experience. While the origins and effects of variation in male
   attractiveness and ornamentation have received much scrutiny, the causes
   and consequences of intraspecific variation in females have been
   relatively overlooked. We used cytogenetic cloning techniques developed
   for Drosophila melanogaster to create ``hemiclonal{''} males and females
   with whom we directly observed sexual interaction between individuals of
   different known genetic backgrounds and measured subsequent reproductive
   outcomes. Using this approach, we were able to quantify the genetic
   contribution of each mate to the observed phenotypic variation in
   biologically important traits including mating speed, copulation
   duration, and subsequent offspring production, as well as measure the
   magnitude and direction of intersexual genetic correlation between
   female choosiness and male attractiveness.
   Results: We found significant additive genetic variation contributing to
   mating speed that can be attributed to male genetic identity, female
   genetic identity, but not their interaction. Furthermore we found that
   phenotypic variation in copulation duration had a significant
   male-associated genetic component. Female genetic identity and the
   interaction between male and female genetic identity accounted for a
   substantial amount of the observed phenotypic variation in egg size.
   Although previous research predicts a trade-off between egg size and
   fecundity, this was not evident in our results. We found a strong
   negative genetic correlation between female choosiness and male
   attractiveness, a result that suggests a potentially important role for
   sexually antagonistic alleles in sexual selection processes in our
   population.
   Conclusion: These results further our understanding of sexual selection
   because they identify that genetic identity plays a significant role in
   phenotypic variation in female behaviour and fecundity. This variation
   may be potentially due to ongoing sexual conflict found between the
   sexes for interacting phenotypes. Our unexpected observation of a
   negative correlation between female choosiness and male attractiveness
   highlights the need for more explicit theoretical models of genetic
   covariance to investigate the coevolution of female choosiness and male
   attractiveness.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1231-1243}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Niche construction refers to the activities of organisms that bring
   about changes in their environments, many of which are evolutionarily
   and ecologically consequential. Advocates of niche construction theory
   (NCT) believe that standard evolutionary theory fails to recognize the
   full importance of niche construction, and consequently propose a novel
   view of evolution, in which niche construction and its legacy over time
   (ecological inheritance) are described as evolutionary processes,
   equivalent in importance to natural selection. Here, we subject NCT to
   critical evaluation, in the form of a collaboration between one
   prominent advocate of NCT, and a team of skeptics. We discuss whether
   niche construction is an evolutionary process, whether NCT obscures or
   clarifies how natural selection leads to organismal adaptation, and
   whether niche construction and natural selection are of equivalent
   explanatory importance. We also consider whether the literature that
   promotes NCT overstates the significance of niche construction, whether
   it is internally coherent, and whether it accurately portrays standard
   evolutionary theory. Our disagreements reflect a wider dispute within
   evolutionary theory over whether the neo-Darwinian synthesis is in need
   of reformulation, as well as different usages of some key terms (e.g.,
   evolutionary process).}},

Title = {{The Evolution of Multivariate Maternal Effects}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in predicting the social and ecological
   contexts that favor the evolution of maternal effects. Most predictions
   focus, however, on maternal effects that affect only a single character,
   whereas the evolution of maternal effects is poorly understood in the
   presence of suites of interacting traits. To overcome this, we simulate
   the evolution of multivariate maternal effects (captured by the matrix
   M) in a fluctuating environment. We find that the rate of environmental
   fluctuations has a substantial effect on the properties of M: in slowly
   changing environments, offspring are selected to have a multivariate
   phenotype roughly similar to the maternal phenotype, so that M is
   characterized by positive dominant eigenvalues; by contrast, rapidly
   changing environments favor Ms with dominant eigenvalues that are
   negative, as offspring favor a phenotype which substantially differs
   from the maternal phenotype. Moreover, when fluctuating selection on one
   maternal character is temporally delayed relative to selection on other
   traits, we find a striking pattern of cross-trait maternal effects in
   which maternal characters influence not only the same character in
   offspring, but also other offspring characters. Additionally, when
   selection on one character contains more stochastic noise relative to
   selection on other traits, large cross-trait maternal effects evolve
   from those maternal traits that experience the smallest amounts of
   noise. The presence of these cross-trait maternal effects shows that
   individual maternal effects cannot be studied in isolation, and that
   their study in a multivariate context may provide important insights
   about the nature of past selection. Our results call for more studies
   that measure multivariate maternal effects in wild populations.}},

Abstract = {{Because of a ban on the use of beak trimming in some European countries,
   feather pecking is becoming a substantial problem in the layer industry,
   both from animal welfare and economic points of view. The feather
   condition score (FCS) as a measure of feather damage has been shown to
   be closely related to feather pecking behavior in laying hens housed in
   groups. To obtain a better understanding of genetic and other biological
   mechanisms underlying feather pecking behavior, data on FCS of a
   population of 2,724 female offspring from crossing 50 male W1 and 907
   female WB purebred lines were used. The offspring of 25 sires were
   beak-trimmed, and the offspring of another 25 sires were
   non-beak-trimmed. Titers of plasma natural antibody (NAb) isotypes IgM
   and IgG binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin at 24 wk of age were measured.
   Feather condition was scored at 53 wk of age. In the first part of the
   present study, we estimated genetic parameters for FCS with 2 variance
   components models: a traditional linear animal model and a model
   combining direct and associative genetic effects. In the second part of
   the present study, a trait-based analysis for FCS was conducted to
   investigate whether NAb isotype titers can explain variation in FCS
   among individuals, by fitting a linear mixed model. Though the estimated
   associative genetic variance was substantial, associative effects for
   FCS were not statistically significant in both populations (P = 0.09 in
   beak-trimmed birds, and P = 0.08 in non-beak-trimmed birds). This
   suggests an insufficient number of records on FCS. Individual's NAb
   isotypes titers did not show direct effect for FCS of itself, but
   individual's IgG titers showed a suggestive effect on the FCS of cage
   mates (associative effect) in beak-trimmed laying hens, which need
   further confirmation.}},

Abstract = {{Social context is often a primary regulator of social behavior, but
   genes that affect or are affected by social context have rarely been
   investigated. In social insects, caste specific pheromones are key
   modulators of social behavior, e.g., in honey bees the queen mandibular
   gland (MG) pheromone mediates reproductive dominance, its absence
   prompting ovary activation and queen pheromone production in workers.
   Here, we investigate the effect of social environment on genome-wide
   expression patterns in the MG, to determine how social context modulates
   expression of genes that, in turn alter social environment. We used
   microarrays to examine the MGs of virgin and mated queens, and
   queenright (QR) and queenless (QL) workers with or without activated
   ovaries. Approximately 2554 transcripts were significantly
   differentially expressed among these groups, with caste and social
   context being the main regulators of gene expression patterns, while
   physiological state (ovary activation) only minimally affecting gene
   expression. Thus, social context strongly regulates expression of genes,
   which, in turn, shape social environment. Among these, 25 genes that are
   putatively involved in caste selective production of the fatty-acid
   derived MG pheromone were differentially expressed in queens and
   workers. These genes whose functions correspond with enzymatic or
   transport processes emphasize the occurrence of disparate pheromone
   biosynthetic pathways for queens and workers, adding another dimension
   regarding the regulation of these important pheromones. Gene ontology
   analysis also revealed genes of different functional categories whose
   expression was impacted by caste or by the social environment,
   suggesting that the MG has broader functions than pheromone
   biosynthesis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The Influence of Social Environment: Behavior of Unrelated Adults
   Affects Future Juvenile Behaviors}},

Volume = {{120}},

Abstract = {{Juveniles' behaviors are often influenced by the behaviors of
   conspecifics. Most experimental studies of the influence of conspecific
   behavior vary the social environment by the presence or absence of
   conspecifics or investigate the impact of the outcome of social
   encounters (winner/loser effects) but less frequently expose individuals
   to variation in behavioral phenotypes present in the social environment.
   Based on previous work showing that juveniles of the salamander
   Plethodon cinereus are likely to interact frequently with non-parental
   adults, I hypothesized that territorial adults in the social environment
   alter the future behaviors of juveniles. I measured the intracohort
   social behaviors of juvenile salamanders collected from two geographic
   areas, Michigan (MI) and Virginia (VA), before and after housing with
   ostensibly territorial (VA) or non-territorial (MI) adults. There were
   overall effects of adult territoriality and aggression on the behavior
   of juveniles. However, juveniles from populations in MI were especially
   susceptible to behavioral modification. Compared with behaviors prior to
   being housed with adults, MI juveniles increased investigatory and
   escape behaviors in juvenile-juvenile interactions after being housed
   with adults that displayed territorial behaviors and decreased
   investigatory and escape behaviors after being housed with
   non-territorial adults. This study shows that not only is a specific
   behavior, territoriality of adult salamanders, a social environment that
   modifies future juvenile behaviors, but the effects of social
   environment may differ between populations.}},

Volume = {{41}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Social selection and indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are established
   concepts in both behavioural ecology and evolutionary genetics. While
   IGEs describe effects of an individual's genotype on phenotypes of
   social partners (and may thus affect their fitness indirectly), the
   concept of social selection assumes that a given phenotype in one
   individual affects the fitness of other individuals directly. Although
   different frameworks, both have been used to investigate the evolution
   of social traits, such as cooperative behaviour. Despite their
   similarities (both concepts consider interactions among individuals),
   they differ in the type of interaction. It remains unclear whether the
   two concepts make the same predictions about evolutionary trajectories
   or not. To address this question, we investigate four possible scenarios
   of social interactions and compare the effects of IGEs and social
   selection for trait evolution in a multi-trait multi-member model. We
   show that the two mechanisms can yield similar evolutionary outcomes and
   that both can create selection pressure at the group level. However, the
   effect of IGEs can be stronger due to the possibility of feedback loops.
   Finally, we demonstrate that IGEs, but not social selection gradients,
   may lead to differences in the direction of evolutionary response
   between genotypes and phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Blue tit females that defend themselves aggressively are passive when
   they defend offspring, but this relationship is opposite in males. Our
   findings imply that the 2 sexes differentially value themselves versus
   their young possibly because of the different reproductive roles they
   have.The direction of covariation in behavioral traits (a behavioral
   syndrome) is typically the same in males and females, although
   intersexual differences in life history could lead to intersexual
   heterogeneity in syndrome structure. We explored whether a behavioral
   syndrome was the same in both sexes. We recorded 2 metrics of nest
   defense in wild blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus: 1) Nest defense of a
   female around the time her eggs hatch (hatching defense), 2) nest
   defense of the male and female parent when their offspring was 16 days
   old (nestling defense), and 3) handling aggression. We used repeated
   records of these behaviors collected on 392 females and 363 males during
   2007-2012 in a hierarchical mixed model to separate the
   between-individual from the residual (co)variances. We find that 1)
   hatching defense is not repeatable across breeding seasons (but highly
   repeatable within years). 2) Nestling defense intensity is 38\%
   repeatable in males and females. 3) Contrary to our expectation, females
   that defended their nestlings more intensively were less aggressive when
   being handled (negative between-individual correlation), but 4) nestling
   defense and handling aggression showed a positive between-individual
   correlation in males although nonsignificantly. These correlations were
   completely masked on the phenotypic level by a low residual correlation.
   Individuals may hence display repeatable and correlated aggressive
   behavior in different contexts, but the direction of this syndrome may
   differ between the sexes. Intersexual heterogeneity in animal
   personality and syndrome structure remains poorly understood, and our
   findings hence urge future work to explicitly consider this
   heterogeneity.}},

Title = {{Epistasis between adults and larvae underlies caste fate and fitness in
   a clonal ant}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In social species, the phenotype and fitness of an individual depend in
   part on the genotype of its social partners. However, how these indirect
   genetic effects affect genotype fitness in competitive situations is
   poorly understood in animal societies. We therefore studied phenotypic
   plasticity and fitness of two clones of the ant Cerapachys biroi in
   monoclonal and chimeric colonies. Here we show that, while clone B has
   lower fitness in isolation, surprisingly, it consistently outcompetes
   clone A in chimeras. The reason is that, in chimeras, clone B produces
   more individuals specializing in reproduction rather than cooperative
   tasks, behaving like a facultative social parasite. A cross-fostering
   experiment shows that the proportion of these individuals depends on
   intergenomic epistasis between larvae and nursing adults, explaining the
   flexible allocation strategy of clone B. Our results suggest that
   intergenomic epistasis can be the proximate mechanism for social
   parasitism in ants, revealing striking analogies between social insects
   and social microbes.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are widespread, both in natural
   and domestic populations. As a result, trait values of individuals may
   be affected by genes in other individuals, a phenomenon known as
   indirect genetic effects (IGEs). IGEs can be estimated using linear
   mixed models. The traditional IGE model assumes that an individual
   interacts equally with all its partners, whether kin or strangers. There
   is abundant evidence, however, that individuals behave differently
   towards kin as compared with strangers, which agrees with predictions
   from kin-selection theory. With a mix of kin and strangers, therefore,
   IGEs estimated from a traditional model may be incorrect, and selection
   based on those estimates will be suboptimal. Here we investigate whether
   genetic parameters for IGEs are statistically identifiable in
   group-structured populations when IGEs differ between kin and strangers,
   and develop models to estimate such parameters. First, we extend the
   definition of total breeding value and total heritable variance to cases
   where IGEs depend on relatedness. Next, we show that the full set of
   genetic parameters is not identifiable when IGEs differ between kin and
   strangers. Subsequently, we present a reduced model that yields
   estimates of the total heritable effects on kin, on non-kin and on all
   social partners of an individual, as well as the total heritable
   variance for response to selection. Finally we discuss the consequences
   of analysing data in which IGEs depend on relatedness using a
   traditional IGE model, and investigate group structures that may allow
   estimation of the full set of genetic parameters when IGEs depend on
   kin.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of phenotypic covariances among genetically related
   individuals is the basis for estimations of genetic and phenotypic
   effects on phenotypes. Beyond heritability, there are several other
   estimates that can be made with behavior genetic models of interest to
   primatologists. Some of these estimates are feasible with primate
   samples because they take advantage of the types of relatives available
   to compare in primate species and because most behaviors are expressed
   orders of magnitude more often and in a greater variety of contexts than
   morphological or life-history traits. The hypotheses that can be tested
   with these estimates are contrasted with hypotheses that will be
   difficult to achieve in primates because of sample size limitations.
   Feasible comparisons include the proportion of variance from interaction
   effects, the variation of genetic effects across environments, and the
   genetics of growth and development. Simulation shows that uncertainty of
   genetic parameters can be reduced by sampling each individual more than
   once. Because sample sizes are likely to remain relatively small in most
   primate behavior genetics, expressing uncertainty in parameter estimates
   is needed to move our inferences forward.}},

Abstract = {{In many species, males have the capacity to directly influence (either

   substances passed on to their mates in their ejaculates. Here, we
   examine how an individual male's identity may be related to phenotypic
   variation in short-term female fecundity in the model species,
   Drosophila melanogaster. The effect of male identity on short-term
   fecundity stimulation of females was repeatable across time and
   accounted for over a fifth of the total observed phenotypic variation in
   fecundity in two independent populations. The functional explanations

Abstract = {{1Predicting the response of communities and ecosystems to range shifts
   as a consequence of global climate change is a critical challenge
   confronting modern evolutionary ecologists. Indirect genetic effects
   (IGEs) occur when the expression of genes in a conspecific neighbouring
   species affects the phenotype of a focal species, and the same concept
   applies for interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGEs) except that
   the neighbouring species is then required to be heterospecific. Theory
   and empirical data indicate that indirect genetic effects and
   interspecific indirect genetic effects have fundamental roles in
   understanding the consequences of genotypic diversity, evolutionary
   feedbacks, the co-evolutionary process and coadaptation and are a
   primary mechanism for the broad ecological and evolutionary dynamics
   that are likely to be a consequence of climate change. When indirect
   genetic effects and interspecific indirect genetic effects occur along
   environmental gradients, both positive and negative feedbacks can
   evolve, resulting in regions of strong local adaptation and competition
   as well as regions of complementarity and facilitation. Such
   evolutionary dynamics have direct consequences for how individuals
   interact and evolve in mixture and drive the services ecosystems
   provide. Integrating indirect genetic effects and interspecific indirect
   genetic effects, feedbacks and diversity effects along environmental
   gradients represents a major conceptual, theoretical and empirical
   frontier that must be considered to understand the whole-system
   consequences of climate change on biodiversity and the services
   ecosystems provide.}},

Abstract = {{Community genetics research has demonstrated bottom-up' effects of
   genetic variation within a plant species in shaping the larger community

   complex of treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to ask whether male
   mating signals are influenced by host plant genetic variation. We reared
   a random sample of the treehoppers on potted replicates of a sample of
   host plant clone lines. We found that treehopper male signals varied
   according to the clone line on which they developed, showing that
   genetic variation in host plants affects male treehoppers' behavioural
   phenotypes. This is the first demonstration of cross-trophic indirect
   genetic effects on a sexually selected trait. We discuss how such

Abstract = {{Niche construction occurs when the traits of an organism influence the
   environment that it experiences. Research has focused on
   niche-constructing traits that are fixed within populations or species.
   However, evidence increasingly demonstrates that niche-constructing
   traits vary among genotypes within populations. Here, we consider the
   potential implications of genetic variation in niche construction for
   evolutionary genetics. Specifically, genetic variation in
   niche-constructing traits creates a correlation between genotype and
   environment. Because the environment influences which genes and genetic
   interactions underlie trait variation, genetic variation in niche
   construction can alter inferences about the heritability, pleiotropy,
   and epistasis of traits that are phenotypically plastic. The effects of
   niche construction on these key evolutionary parameters further suggest
   novel ways by which niche construction can influence evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGE) occur when the genotype of an individual
   affects the phenotypic trait value of another conspecific individual.
   IGEs can have profound effects on both the magnitude and the direction
   of response to selection. Models of inheritance and response to
   selection in traits subject to IGEs have been developed within two
   frameworks; a trait-based framework in which IGEs are specified as a
   direct consequence of individual trait values, and a variance-component
   framework in which phenotypic variance is decomposed into a direct and
   an indirect additive genetic component. This work is a selective review
   of the quantitative genetics of traits affected by IGEs, with a focus on
   modelling, estimation and interpretation issues. It includes a
   discussion on variance-component vs trait-based models of IGEs, a review
   of issues related to the estimation of IGEs from field data, including
   the estimation of the interaction coefficient W (psi), and a discussion
   on the relevance of IGEs for response to selection in cases where the
   strength of interaction varies among pairs of individuals. An
   investigation of the trait-based model shows that the interaction
   coefficient W may deviate considerably from the corresponding regression
   coefficient when feedback occurs. The increasing research effort devoted
   to IGEs suggests that they are a widespread phenomenon, probably
   particularly in natural populations and plants. Further work in this
   field should considerably broaden our understanding of the quantitative
   genetics of inheritance and response to selection in relation to the
   social organisation of populations.}},

Title = {{Competition as a source of constraint on life history evolution in

Volume = {{112}},

Pages = {{70-78}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Competition among individuals is central to our understanding of ecology
   and population dynamics. However, it could also have major implications
   for the evolution of resource-dependent life history traits (for
   example, growth, fecundity) that are important determinants of fitness
   in natural populations. This is because when competition occurs, the
   phenotype of each individual will be causally influenced by the
   phenotypes, and so the genotypes, of competitors. Theory tells us that
   indirect genetic effects arising from competitive interactions will give
   rise to the phenomenon of `evolutionary environmental deterioration',
   and act as a source of evolutionary constraint on resource-dependent
   traits under natural selection. However, just how important this
   constraint is remains an unanswered question. This article seeks to
   stimulate empirical research in this area, first highlighting some
   patterns emerging from life history studies that are consistent with a
   competition-based model of evolutionary constraint, before describing
   several quantitative modelling strategies that could be usefully
   applied. A recurrent theme is that rigorous quantification of a
   competition's impact on life history evolution will require an
   understanding of the causal pathways and behavioural processes by which
   genetic (co) variance structures arise. Knowledge of the G-matrix among
   life history traits is not, in and of itself, sufficient to identify the
   constraints caused by competition.}},

Abstract = {{Social dynamics, the emergent effects of interactions within structured
   groups, play a key role in shaping social phenotypes and fitness. We
   examined the potential positive and negative effects of social dynamics
   in simple groups, by creating social groups of harvester ant queens with
   2 alternate nest-founding strategies, solitary versus cooperative. We
   compared social interactions, survival, and nest productivity of pairs
   containing queens from the cooperative founding population, the normally
   solitary founding population, or mixed pairs of the 2 types. Expressed
   social phenotypes of queens in pairs depended strongly on the lineage of
   the other queen. Two behaviors, aggression and brood care, showed simple
   social dynamical effects. Aggression escalated in pairs of normally
   solitary queens, whereas queens in cooperative pairs coordinated brood
   output, leading to more efficient worker production. These dynamics had
   context-based fitness consequences, such that cooperative queens gained
   a survival advantage in cooperative pairs, but neither type of queen
   experienced an advantage or disadvantage in ``mixed{''} associations.
   The interplay between social dynamics and fitness in these associations
   provides an empirical example of social selection. It captures a likely
   scenario of the transition to and the early evolution of cooperative
   living, in which cooperative individuals interact with solitary
   individuals who lack a priori strategies for cooperation or cheating.}},

Abstract = {{Injurious pecking is a serious concern for commercial turkey production
   and welfare. The behaviour is thought to represent re-directed ground
   foraging, but the development and causes are poorly understood with
   little supporting literature. In the initial development of the
   behaviour, early lighting regimes and social facilitation may play
   contributing roles. Other factors such as the availability of foraging
   material, diet composition, stocking densities, and group dynamics may
   also affect levels of injurious pecking. Given that commercial turkeys
   are group-housed, alternative breeding techniques, like group selection
   based on social effects, might successfully reduce moralities from
   pecking without detracting selection pressure from economic traits.
   However, to better suit their behavioural needs, any genetic attempts to
   adapt turkeys to perform less injurious pecking should be done in
   combination with environmental and dietary improvements.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) describe how an individual's
   behaviour-which is influenced by his or her genotype-can affect the
   behaviours of interacting individuals. IGE research has focused on
   dyads. However, insights from social networks research, and other
   studies of group behaviour, suggest that dyadic interactions are
   affected by the behaviour of other individuals in the group. To extend
   IGE inferences to groups of three or more, IGEs must be considered from
   a group perspective. Here, I introduce the `focal interaction' approach
   to study IGEs in groups. I illustrate the utility of this approach by
   studying aggression among natural genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster.
   I chose two natural genotypes as `focal interactants': the behavioural
   interaction between them was the `focal interaction'. One male from each
   focal interactant genotype was present in every group, and I varied the
   genotype of the third male-the `treatment male'. Genetic variation in
   the treatment male's aggressive behaviour influenced the focal
   interaction, demonstrating that IGEs in groups are not a straightforward
   extension of IGEs measured in dyads. Further, the focal interaction
   influenced male mating success, illustrating the role of IGEs in
   behavioural evolution. These results represent the first manipulative
   evidence for IGEs at the group level.}},

   was modeled as being driven by either purely within-brood or
   between-brood competition. In reality the partitioning of parental
   resources within- versus between-broods is an evolving life history
   trait, which can be affected by parent-offspring interactions. This
   coevolutionary feedback between life history and family interactions may
   influence the evolutionary process and outcome of parent-offspring
   coadaptation. We used a genetic framework for a simulation model where
   we allowed parental parity to coevolve with traits that determine
   parental investment. The model included unlinked loci for clutch size,
   parental sensitivity, baseline provisioning, and offspring begging. The
   simulation showed that tight coadaptation of parent and offspring traits
   only occurred in iteroparous outcomes whereas semelparous outcomes were
   characterized by weak coadaptation. When genetic variation in clutch
   size was unrestricted in the ancestral population, semelparity and
   maximal begging with poor coadaptation evolved throughout. Conversely,
   when genetic variation was limited to iteroparous conditions, and/or
   when parental sensitivity was treated as an evolutionarily fixed sensory
   bias, coadapted outcomes were more likely. Our findings show the
   influence of a feedback between parity, coadaptation, and conflict on
   the evolution of parent-offspring interactions.}},

   Duration across Social Environments in Drosophila melanogaster}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{OCT 14}},
Abstract = {{A key assumption underpinning major models of sexual selection is the
   expectation that male sexual attractiveness is heritable. Surprisingly,
   however, empirical tests of this assumption are relatively scarce. Here
   we use a paternal full-sib/half-sib breeding design to examine genetic
   and environmental variation in male mating latency (a proxy for sexual
   attractiveness) and copulation duration in a natural population of
   Drosophila melanogaster. As our experimental design also involved the
   manipulation of the social environment within each full-sibling family,
   we were able to further test for the presence of genotype-by-environment
   interactions (GEIs) in these traits, which have the potential to
   compromise mate choice for genetic benefits. Our experimental
   manipulation of the social environment revealed plastic expression of
   both traits; males exposed to a rival male during the sensitive period
   of adult sexual maturation exhibited shorter mating latencies and longer
   copulation durations than those who matured in isolation. However, we
   found no evidence for GEIs, and no significant additive genetic
   variation underlying these traits in either environment. These results
   undermine the notion that the evolution of female choice rests on
   covariance between female preference and male displays, an expectation
   that underpins indirect benefit models such as the good genes and sexy
   sons hypotheses. However, our results may also indicate depletion of
   genetic variance in these traits in the natural population studied, thus
   supporting the expectation that traits closely aligned with reproductive
   fitness can exhibit low levels of additive genetic variance.}},

Abstract = {{Many social behaviors are triggered by social partners. For example,
   cells in a multicellular organism often become soma via extrinsically
   regulated differentiation, while individuals in a eusocial colony often
   become helpers via extrinsic caste determination. One explanation for
   social triggering is that it informs when it is beneficial to express
   the behavior. Alternatively, social triggering can represent
   manipulation where social partners partially or completely control the
   focal individual''s behavior. For instance, caste determination in
   primitively eusocial taxa is typically accomplished via differential
   feeding or dominance hierarchies, suggesting some manipulation. However,
   selection would favor resistance if manipulation is detrimental to
   manipulated parties, and the outcome of the manipulation conflict
   remains intricate. We analyze the coevolution of manipulation and
   resistance in a simple but general setting. We show that, despite
   possible resistance, manipulated behavior can be established under less
   stringent conditions than spontaneous (i.e., nonmanipulated) behavior
   because of resistance costs. The existence of this advantage might
   explain why primitive eusocial behavior tends to be triggered socially
   and coercively. We provide a simple condition for the advantage of
   manipulated behavior that may help infer whether a socially triggered
   behavior is manipulated. We illustrate our analysis with a hypothetical
   example of maternal manipulation relevant to primitive eusociality.}},

Abstract = {{Benefits and costs of parental care are expected to change with
   offspring development and lead to age-dependent coadaptation expressed
   as phenotypic (behavioural) matches between offspring age and parental
   reproductive stage. Parents and offspring interact repeatedly over time
   for the provision of parental care. Their behaviours should be
   accordingly adjusted to each other dynamically and adaptively, and the
   phenotypic match between offspring age and parental stage should
   stabilize the repeated behavioural interactions. In the European earwig
   (Forficula auricularia), maternal care is beneficial for offspring
   survival, but not vital, allowing us to investigate the extent to which
   the stability of mother-offspring aggregation is shaped by age-dependent
   coadaptation. In this study, we experimentally cross-fostered nymphs of
   different age classes (younger or older) between females in early or
   late reproductive stage to disrupt age-dependent coadaptation, thereby
   generating female-nymph dyads that were phenotypically matched or
   mismatched. The results revealed a higher stability in aggregation
   during the first larval instar when care is most intense, a steeper
   decline in aggregation tendency over developmental time and a reduced
   developmental rate in matched compared with mismatched families.
   Furthermore, nymph survival was positively correlated with female-nymph
   aggregation stability during the early stages when maternal care is most
   prevalent. These results support the hypothesis that age-related
   phenotypically plastic coadaptation affects family dynamics and
   offspring developmental rate.}},

Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{In many species, consistent behavioural differences among individuals
   are linked to fitness variation. Determining the environmental and
   genetic factors that mould these behavioural types is crucial to
   understanding how behaviours might respond to selection. Male bluefin
   killifish, Lucania goodei, show extensive consistent behavioural
   variation in their levels of courtship, male-directed aggression and
   female-directed aggression, resulting in a range of fitness-related
   behavioural types coexisting within a population. To determine whether
   the behavioural components underlying a male's stable behavioural type
   in the mating context are heritable and genetically correlated, we
   performed paternal half-sib crosses. Using animal models, we found that
   all three of these mating behaviours were moderately heritable (h(2) =
   0.17-0.29) and courtship behaviour was also heritable as a binomial
   trait (court yes/no: h(2) = 0.50). Including effects of dam
   identity/common rearing environment experienced by full sibs decreased
   model fit, suggesting that early social interactions might contribute to
   behavioural types. In addition, we found evidence consistent with the
   possibility that the positive phenotypic correlations among mating
   behaviours are underlain by positive genetic correlations. Thus, it is
   possible that the seemingly maladaptive aggression that males direct
   towards females during social interactions persist due to genetic
   constraints and direct selection on male-directed aggression and
   courtship behaviour. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal

Title = {{Using pooled data to estimate variance components and breeding values
   for traits affected by social interactions}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{45}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Through social interactions, individuals affect one
   another's phenotype. In such cases, an individual's phenotype is
   affected by the direct (genetic) effect of the individual itself and the
   indirect (genetic) effects of the group mates. Using data on individual
   phenotypes, direct and indirect genetic (co)variances can be estimated.
   Together, they compose the total genetic variance that determines a
   population's potential to respond to selection. However, it can be
   difficult or expensive to obtain individual phenotypes. Phenotypes on
   traits such as egg production and feed intake are, therefore, often
   collected on group level. In this study, we investigated whether direct,
   indirect and total genetic variances, and breeding values can be
   estimated from pooled data (pooled by group). In addition, we determined
   the optimal group composition, i.e. the optimal number of families
   represented in a group to minimise the standard error of the estimates.
   Methods: This study was performed in three steps. First, all research
   questions were answered by theoretical derivations. Second, a simulation
   study was conducted to investigate the estimation of variance components
   and optimal group composition. Third, individual and pooled survival
   records on 12 944 purebred laying hens were analysed to investigate the
   estimation of breeding values and response to selection.
   Results: Through theoretical derivations and simulations, we showed that
   the total genetic variance can be estimated from pooled data, but the
   underlying direct and indirect genetic (co)variances cannot. Moreover,
   we showed that the most accurate estimates are obtained when group
   members belong to the same family. Additional theoretical derivations
   and data analyses on survival records showed that the total genetic
   variance and breeding values can be estimated from pooled data.
   Moreover, the correlation between the estimated total breeding values
   obtained from individual and pooled data was surprisingly close to one.
   This indicates that, for survival in purebred laying hens, loss in
   response to selection will be small when using pooled instead of
   individual data.
   Conclusions: Using pooled data, the total genetic variance and breeding
   values can be estimated, but the underlying genetic components cannot.
   The most accurate estimates are obtained when group members belong to
   the same family.}},

Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Patterns of phenotypic variation arise in part from plasticity owing to
   social interactions, and these patterns contribute, in turn, to the form
   of selection that shapes the variation we observe in natural
   populations. This proximate-ultimate dynamic brings genetic variation in
   social environments to the forefront of evolutionary theory. However,
   the extent of this variation remains largely unknown. Here, we use a
   member of the Enchenopa binotata species complex of treehoppers
   (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to assess how mate preferences are influenced
   by genetic variation in the social environment. We used full-sibling
   split-families as `treatment' social environments, and reared focal
   females alongside each treatment family, describing the mate preferences
   of the focal females. With this method, we detected substantial genetic
   variation in social influence on mate preferences. The mate preferences
   of focal females varied according to the treatment families along with
   which they grew up. We discuss the evolutionary implications of the
   presence of such genetic variation in social influence on mate
   preferences, including potential contributions to the maintenance of
   genetic variation, the promotion of divergence, and the adaptive
   evolution of social effects on fitness-related traits.}},

Pages = {{R577-R584}},
Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{Inclusive fitness theory captures how individuals can influence the
   transmission of their genes to future generations by influencing either
   their own reproductive success or that of related individuals. This
   framework is frequently used for studying the way in which natural
   selection leads to organisms being adapted to their environments. A
   number of recent papers have criticised this approach, suggesting that
   inclusive fitness is just one of many possible mathematical methods for
   modelling when traits will be favoured by natural selection, and that it
   leads to errors, such as overemphasising the role of common ancestry
   relative to other mechanisms that could lead to individuals being
   genetically related. Here, we argue that these suggested problems arise
   from a misunderstanding of two fundamental points; first, inclusive
   fitness is more than just a mathematical `accounting method' - it is the
   answer to the question of what organisms should appear designed to
   maximise; second, there is something special about relatedness caused by
   common ancestry, in contrast with the other mechanisms that may lead to
   individuals being genetically related, because it unites the interests
   of genes across the genome, allowing complex, multigenic adaptations to
   evolve. The critiques of inclusive fitness theory have provided neither
   an equally valid answer to the question of what organisms should appear
   designed to maximise, nor an alternative process to unite the interest
   of genes. Consequently, inclusive fitness remains the most general
   theory for explaining adaptation.}},

Volume = {{86}},

Pages = {{11-16}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Although the role of animal signals in the resolution of family
   conflicts has been thoroughly studied, it has been typically analysed in
   isolated two-player interactions. For instance, parents are usually
   considered as the sole receivers of offspring begging signals or mates
   the receivers of sexual displays. However, this view does not wholly
   encompass the dynamic and complex nature of the family scenario. In this
   essay, we review for the first time the clearest evidence of animal
   signals found to play a role in more than one family context (e.g.
   mate-mate, parent-offspring and sib-sib interactions). We then argue
   that these signals might have coevolved in multiple family contexts
   because the whole network of related individuals shares genes and
   similar physiological mechanisms underlying signal expression and
   perception abilities. Finally, we propose candidate traits that we would
   expect to function in multiple family contexts and we consider questions
   that could be addressed in further studies to understand better the
   evolution of family signals. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of

Title = {{Measuring same-sex sexual behaviour: the influence of the male social
   environment}},

Volume = {{86}},

Pages = {{91-100}},

Abstract = {{Same-sex sexual behaviour (SSB) is attracting increasing research
   attention, but quantifying and interpreting SSB present unique
   challenges. Chief among these are (1) partitioning the expression of SSB
   into separate influences from interacting partners, (2) distinguishing
   between same-sex behaviour, same-sex preference and same-sex orientation
   and testing for correlations between them, and (3) evaluating how the
   social environment modulates the expression of SSB. We used sexually
   mature male Drosophila melanogaster in staged encounters to address
   these aims. The expression of SSB was not consistent across choice and
   no-choice experimental trials, indicating that a tendency to display SSB
   when females are absent does not correlate with greater same-sex
   preference when a choice is available. The expression of SSB was
   sensitive to the social experience of males. Experience with other males
   and experience with females both decreased the incidence of male SSB,
   suggesting that both avoidance learning and mating experience mitigate
   its expression. SSB in D. melanogaster appears to be a highly labile
   trait susceptible to varied influences from the social environment. We
   suggest that SSB expressed in different social contexts probably
   represents different physiological origins, which is a potentially
   important consideration in studies examining its genetic architecture
   and evolutionary maintenance. (C) 2013 The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Although our understanding of how animal personality affects fitness is
   incomplete, one general hypothesis is that personality traits (e.g.
   boldness and aggressiveness) contribute to competitive ability. If so,
   then under resource limitation, personality differences will generate
   variation in life history traits crucial to fitness, like growth. Here,
   we test this idea using data from same-sex dyadic interaction trials of
   sheepshead swordtails (Xiphophorus birchmanni). In males, there was
   evidence of repeatable variation across a suite of agonistic contest
   behaviours, while repeatable opponent effects on focal behaviour were
   also detected. A single vector explains 80 \% of the among-individual
   variance in multivariate phenotype and can be viewed as aggressiveness.
   We also find that aggressiveness predicts dominance-the repeatable
   tendency to win food in competition-and dominant individuals show faster
   post-trial weight gain (independently of initial size). In females, a
   dominance hierarchy predictive of weight gain was also found, but there
   was no evidence of variation in aggressiveness. While size often
   predicts contest outcome, our results show that individuals may
   sometimes grow larger because they are behaviourally dominant rather
   than vice versa. When resources are limited, personality traits such as
   aggression can influence growth, life history, and fitness through
   impacts on resource acquisition.}},

Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Host-parasite interactions are a key paradigm for understanding the
   process of coevolution. Central to coevolution is how genetic variation
   in interacting species allows parasites to evolve manipulative
   strategies. However, genetic variation in the parasite may also be
   associated with host phenotype changes, thereby changing the selection
   on both species. For instance, parasites often induce changes in the
   behaviour of their host to maximize their own fitness, yet the
   quantitative genetic basis for behavioural manipulation has not been
   fully demonstrated. Here, we show that the genotype of the parasitoid
   wasp Aphidius ervi has a significant effect on where its aphid host
   Acyrthosiphon pisum moves to die following parasitism, including the
   likelihood that the aphid abandons the plant. These results provide a
   clear example of an interspecific indirect genetic effect whereby the
   genetics of one species influences the expression of a specific
   behavioural trait in another.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms that face behavioural challenges can use different types of
   information to guide their decisions. First, they can use the personal
   information they sample in their environment. Second, they can use the
   inadvertent social information provided by the behaviour of conspecifics
   or heterospecifics (i.e. public information). Currently, little is known
   about the interaction between genetic variation and the use of personal
   versus public information in natural populations. Here, we investigated
   whether a natural genetic polymorphism affects the use of personal
   versus public information in a spatial learning task in Drosophila
   melanogaster. We found that genetic variation at the foraging locus
   interacts with social context during spatial learning. While both
   allelic variants are able to use personal and public information to
   improve their navigation during 10 training trials, a probe trial
   revealed that individuals carrying the for(R) (rover) allele rely mainly
   on personal information, whereas individuals carrying the for(s)
   (sitter) allele either use or display more public information than
   rovers. Accordingly, transfer of social information is more important in
   groups of sitters than in groups of rovers. These results suggest that a
   positive feedback loop can occur between alleles promoting group living,
   such as for(s), and the use and/or display of public information,
   ultimately providing the opportunity for the joint evolution of
   sociality and cultural traits.}},

Title = {{Indirect Genetic Effects and Housing Conditions in Relation to
   Aggressive Behaviour in Pigs}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Indirect Genetic Effects (IGEs), also known as associative effects, are
   the heritable effects that an individual has on the phenotype of its
   social partners. Selection for IGEs has been proposed as a method to
   reduce harmful behaviours, in particular aggression, in livestock and
   aquaculture. The mechanisms behind IGEs, however, have rarely been
   studied. The objective was therefore to assess aggression in pigs which
   were divergently selected for IGEs on growth (IGEg). In a one generation
   selection experiment, we studied 480 offspring of pigs (Sus scrofa) that
   were selected for relatively high or low IGEg and housed in homogeneous
   IGEg groups in either barren or enriched environments. Skin lesion
   scores, a proxy measure of aggression, and aggressive behaviours were
   recorded. The two distinct IGEg groups did not differ in number of skin
   lesions, or in amount of reciprocal fighting, both under stable social
   conditions and in confrontation with unfamiliar pigs in a 24 h
   regrouping test. Pigs selected for a positive effect on the growth of
   their group members, however, performed less non-reciprocal biting and
   showed considerably less aggression at reunion with familiar group
   members after they had been separated during a 24 h regrouping test. The
   enriched environment was associated with more skin lesions but less
   non-reciprocal biting under stable social conditions. Changes in
   aggression between pigs selected for IGEg were not influenced by GxE
   interactions with regard to the level of environmental enrichment. It is
   likely that selection on IGEg targets a behavioural strategy, rather
   than a single behavioural trait such as aggressiveness.}},

Abstract = {{In some animals, offspring begging is elicited by parents through
   behavioural or morphological signals. The red spot on the lower mandible
   in adult gulls is one of the best-known examples of a signal triggering
   chick begging. We examined whether the begging response of chicks
   (pecking for food and the chatter call for drawing parental attention)
   was affected by the spot size within the natural range of variation on a
   dummy head. Using a cross-fostering experiment, we examined whether
   these responses covary with the size of the genetic or social parent's
   spot. We found that the natural variation in size of this parental
   signal strongly influenced intensity of chick begging. Pecking increased
   when chicks were stimulated by a larger red spot. Additionally, pecking
   intensity increased in chicks reared by mothers with a large red spot,
   suggesting that this begging component is influenced by previous
   experience. In contrast, chick hatching order affected the number of
   chatter calls produced in relation to the size of the red spot on the
   dummy, suggesting the presence of different begging strategies according
   to brood hierarchy. The differential call response to a small/large red
   spot on the dummy was positively correlated with the original mothers'
   red spot size and negatively with that of the original fathers. These
   results suggest a genetic correlation between biased chick response for
   a large spot and parental signal in contrasting patterns for mothers and
   fathers. Our results suggest that the parental red spot and offspring
   begging are traits subject to coevolution. (C) 2013 The Association for

Title = {{Belowground interactions shift the relative importance of direct and

Abstract = {{Intraspecific genetic variation can affect decomposition, nutrient
   cycling, and interactions between plants and their associated
   belowground communities. However, the effects of genetic variation on
   ecosystems can also be indirect, meaning that genes in a focal plant may
   affect ecosystems by altering the phenotype of interacting (i.e.,
   neighboring) individuals. We manipulated genotype identity, species
   identity, and the possibility of belowground interactions between
   neighboring Solidago plants. We hypothesized that, because our plants
   were nitrogen (N) limited, the most important interactions between focal
   and neighbor plants would occur belowground. More specifically, we
   hypothesized that the genotypic identity of a plant's neighbor would
   have a larger effect on belowground biomass than on aboveground biomass,
   but only when neighboring plants were allowed to interact belowground.
   We detected species- and genotype-level variation for aboveground
   biomass and ramet production. We also found that belowground biomass and
   ramet production depended on the interaction of neighbor genotype
   identity and the presence or absence of belowground interactions.
   Additionally, we found that interspecific indirect genetic effects
   (IIGEs; changes in focal plant traits due to the genotype identity of a
   heterospecific neighbor) had a greater effect size on belowground
   biomass than did focal genotype; however, this effect only held in pots
   that allowed belowground interactions. These results expand the types of
   natural processes that can be attributed to genotypes by showing that,
   under certain conditions, a plant's phenotype can be strongly determined
   by the expression of genes in its neighbor. By showing that IIGEs are
   dependent upon plants being able to interact belowground, our results
   also provide a first step for thinking about how genotype-based,
   belowground interactions influence the evolutionary outcomes of
   plant-neighbor interactions.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1234-1243}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The genetic variance-covariance (G) matrix describes the variances and
   covariances of genetic traits under strict genetic inheritance.
   Genetically expressed traits often influence trait expression in another
   via nongenetic forms of transmission and inheritance, however. The
   importance of non-genetic influences on phenotypic evolution is
   increasingly clear, but how genetic and nongenetic inheritance interact
   to determine the response to selection is not well understood. Here, we
   use the reachability matrix' - a key analytical tool of geometric
   control theory - to integrate both forms of inheritance, capturing how
   the consequences of generation-lagged maternal effects accumulate.
   Building on the classic Lande and Kirkpatrick model that showed how
   nongenetic (maternal) inheritance fundamentally alters the expected path
   of phenotypic evolution, we make novel inferences through decomposition
   of the reachability matrix. In particular, we quantify how nongenetic
   inheritance affects the distribution (orientation and shape) of ellipses
   of phenotypic change and how these distributions influence subsequent
   evolution. This interweaving of phenotypic means and variances
   accumulates generation by generation and is described analytically by
   the reachability matrix, which acts as an analogue of G when genetic and
   nongenetic inheritance both act.}},

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted comparing multilevel selection in Japanese
   quail for 43 days weight and survival with birds housed in either kin
   (K) or random (R) groups. Multilevel selection significantly reduced
   mortality (6.6\% K vs. 8.5\% R) and increased weight (1.30 g/MG K vs.
   0.13 g/MG R) resulting in response an order of magnitude greater with
   Kin than Random. Thus, multilevel selection was effective in reducing
   detrimental social interactions, which contributed to improved weight
   gain. The observed rates of response did not differ significantly from
   expected, demonstrating that current theory is adequate to explain
   multilevel selection response. Based on estimated genetic parameters,
   group selection would always be superior to any other combination of
   multilevel selection. Further, near optimal results could be attained
   using multilevel selection if 20\% of the weight was on the group
   component regardless of group composition. Thus, in nature the
   conditions for multilevel selection to be effective in bringing about
   social change maybe common. In terms of a sustainability of breeding
   programs, multilevel selection is easy to implement and is expected to
   give near optimal responses with reduced rates of inbreeding as compared
   to group selection, the only requirement is that animals be housed in
   kin groups.}},

Abstract = {{Mate choice often depends on the properties of both sexes, such as the
   preference and responsiveness of the female and the sexual display
   traits of the male. Quantitative genetic studies, however, traditionally
   explore the outcome of an interaction between males and females based
   solely on the genotype of one sex, treating the other sex as a source of
   environmental variance. Here, we use a half-sib breeding design in the
   field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus, to estimate the additive genetic
   contribution of both partners to three steps of the mate choice process:
   the time taken to mate; the duration of spermatophore attachment; and
   the intensity of mate guarding. Rather than each sex contributing
   equally to the interactions, we found that genetic variation for latency
   to mate and spermatophore attachment was sex-specific, and in the case
   of mate-guarding intensity, largely absent. For a given interaction,
   genetic variation in one sex also appears to be largely independent of
   the other, and is also uncorrelated with the other traits. We discuss
   how pre- and postcopulatory interactions have the potential to evolve as
   an interacting phenotype, but that any coevolution between these traits,
   due to sexual selection or sexual conflict, may be limited.}},

Abstract = {{A recent discussion in this journal (Dingemanse et al. Behav Ecol
   Sociobiol 66: 1543-1548, 2012; Garamszegi and Herczeg Behav Ecol
   Socibiol 66:1651-1658, 2012) deals with a core issue in animal
   personality research: Can animal personality research quantify
   correlated behaviors on the between-individual level, or is this too
   demanding in terms of design and analysis of the data, and should
   behavioral ecologists therefore take the ``individual gambit{''} and
   work on the phenotypic level only. Taking this gambit implies accepting
   that the between-individual correlation in behavioral traits (which is
   the correlation of interest) may be masked by a residual correlation of
   different magnitude or sign. Understanding (co)variances on different
   levels is the main thrust of quantitative genetics, and animal
   personality research can make good use of the plethora of ideas and
   analytical approaches developed in this field. I, here, outline reasons
   why the ``individual gambit{''} may or may not work out and its
   relationship to the quantitative genetic ``phenotypic gambit{''}. I
   especially emphasize the meaning of residuals and phenotypic plasticity
   which has not been fully appreciated in the debate thus far. I conclude
   that instead of a priori assuming that between-individual correlations
   are captured sufficiently well by the phenotypic correlation, animal
   personality researchers should set up more ambitious data collection and
   analysis designs to critically test this conjectured equality.}},

Abstract = {{Several personality traits are mainly expressed in a social context, and
   others, which are not restricted to a social context, can be affected by
   the social interactions with conspecifics. In this paper, we focus on
   the recently proposed hypothesis that social niche specialization (i.e.
   individuals in a population occupy different social roles) can explain
   the maintenance of individual differences in personality. We first
   present ecological and social niche specialization hypotheses. In
   particular, we show how niche specialization can be quantified and
   highlight the link between personality differences and social niche
   specialization. We then review some ecological factors (e. g.
   competition and environmental heterogeneity) and the social mechanisms
   (e. g. frequency-dependent, state-dependent and social awareness) that
   may be associated with the evolution of social niche specialization and
   personality differences. Finally, we present a conceptual model and
   methods to quantify the contribution of ecological factors and social
   mechanisms to the dynamics between personality and social roles. In
   doing so, we suggest a series of research objectives to help empirical
   advances in this research area. Throughout this paper, we highlight
   empirical studies of social niche specialization in mammals, where
   available.}},

Abstract = {{In many animals, experience modifies behaviour in a variety of ways and
   contexts. Here we focus on experience of social environments and
   phenotypic plasticity in mate preferences. We first review adaptive
   hypotheses about the evolution of social plasticity in mate preferences,
   finding support for all of them across different species. We suggest
   that future work should assess which patterns of variation in social
   environments select for which forms of plasticity in mate preferences.
   We then highlight that social plasticity in mate preferences creates
   feedback loops between the role of social environments as causes of
   variation in phenotypes and the role of social environments as causes of
   selection on phenotypes. Fully understanding the consequences of these
   feedbacks will involve assessing both how selection shapes the plastic
   response to variation in social environments and how individuals in
   social environments are selected to influence the mate preferences of
   others. This task is just beginning, but we review evidence of genetic
   variation in both of these aspects of social plasticity in mate
   preferences. (c) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Offspring size is often an intimate link between the fitness of parents
   and offspring. Among mammals, neonate mass is also related to adult
   levels of dimorphism and intrasexual competitive mating. We describe the
   sex-specific genetic architecture of neonate mass in captive squirrel
   monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis), a small Neotropical primate. Best fitting
   quantitative genetic models show strong maternal genetic effects with
   little difference between sexes offering limited opportunity for
   neonatal dimorphism to respond to observed or hypothetical selection.
   Heritabilities that are approximately zero also imply it is unlikely
   that neonatal dimorphism can evolve as a correlated response to
   selection on adult size. However, male mass is also more dependent on
   maternal condition (age and parity) making dimorphism plastic. Finally,
   we hypothesize that large maternal genetic effects reflect income
   breeding and tightly synchronized seasonal reproduction in squirrel
   monkeys, both of which require strong maternal control of offspring
   growth and timing of birth.}},

Abstract = {{Models for the evolution of cannibalism highlight the importance of
   asymmetries between individuals in initiating cannibalistic attacks.
   Studies may include measures of body size but typically group
   individuals into size/age classes or compare populations. Such broad
   comparisons may obscure the details of interactions that ultimately
   determine how socially contingent characteristics evolve. We propose
   that understanding cannibalism is facilitated by using an interacting
   phenotypes perspective that includes the influences of the phenotype of
   a social partner on the behaviour of a focal individual and focuses on
   variation in individual pairwise interactions. We investigated how
   relative body size, a composite trait between a focal individual and its
   social partner, and the sex of the partners influenced precannibalistic
   aggression in the endangered Socorro isopod, Thermosphaeroma
   thermophilum. We also investigated whether differences in mating
   interest among males and females influenced cannibalism in mixed sex
   pairs. We studied these questions in three populations that differ
   markedly in range of body size and opportunities for interactions among
   individuals. We found that relative body size influences the probability
   of and latency to attack. We observed differences in the likelihood of
   and latency to attack based on both an individual's sex and the sex of
   its partner but found no evidence of sexual conflict. The instigation of
   precannibalistic aggression in these isopods is therefore a property of
   both an individual and its social partner. Our results suggest that
   interacting phenotype models would be improved by incorporating a new
   conditional , which describes the strength of a social partner's
   influence on focal behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Inbreeding depression is the reduction in fitness caused by mating
   between related individuals. Inbreeding is expected to cause a reduction
   in offspring fitness when the offspring themselves are inbred, but
   outbred individuals may also suffer a reduction in fitness when they
   depend on care from inbred parents. At present, little is known about
   the significance of such intergenerational effects of inbreeding. Here,
   we report two experiments on the burying beetle Nicrophorus
   vespilloides, an insect with elaborate parental care, in which we
   investigated inbreeding depression in offspring when either the
   offspring themselves or their parents were inbred. We found substantial
   inbreeding depression when offspring were inbred, including reductions
   in hatching success of inbred eggs and survival of inbred offspring. We
   also found substantial inbreeding depression when parents were inbred,
   including reductions in hatching success of eggs produced by inbred
   parents and survival of outbred offspring that received care from inbred
   parents. Our results suggest that intergenerational effects of
   inbreeding can have substantial fitness costs to offspring, and that
   future studies need to incorporate such costs to obtain accurate
   estimates of inbreeding depression.}},

Abstract = {{Skew models predict how reproduction or resources produced by the group
   are divided between dominant and subordinate group members. These
   include transactional models, in which one group member may allocate
   some group productivity to another to prevent group dissolution and
   tug-of-war inefficiency models, in which group members compete for
   access to resources at a cost to group productivity. Although skew
   models involve a transactional or competitive interaction among group
   members, most existing models do not allow individuals to respond to new
   information about the strategy of their group mate. Here, I expand
   transactional and tug-of-war models to allow one individual (the
   follower) to respond plastically to a fixed strategy of its partner (the
   leader). I solve for the Stackelberg equilibrium conditions for each
   model. For the transactional model, leadership results in a greater
   share of group productivity to the leader compared with models that do
   not include leadership. When the follower's information about the
   leader's strategy is perfect, the equilibrium division of productivity
   does not vary with relatedness, in contrast to the predictions of
   previous skew models, and the effects of ecological variables may
   change. In the tug-of-war model, leadership influences equilibrium
   investment in competition only if relatedness is greater than zero.
   Dominant leaders receive a larger share of group productivity, but group
   productivity declines and grouping is mutually beneficial over a smaller
   parameter range than in the absence of leadership. Subordinate leaders
   receive a smaller share of group productivity, but benefit from overall
   higher group productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Conspecifics of many animal species physically compete to gain
   reproductive resources and thus fitness. Despite the importance of
   competitive ability across the animal kingdom, specific traits that
   influence or underpin competitive ability are poorly characterized.
   Here, we investigate whether there are genetic influences on competitive
   ability within male house mice. Additionally, we examined if litter
   demographics (litter size and litter sex ratio) influence competitive
   ability. We phenotyped two generations for a male's ability to possess a
   reproductive resource--a prime nesting site--using semi-natural
   enclosures with mixed sex groupings. We used the ``Animal Model{''}
   coupled with an extensive pedigree to estimate several genetic
   parameters. Competitive ability was found to be highly heritable, but
   only displayed a moderate genetic correlation to body mass.
   Interestingly, litter sex ratio had a weak negative influence on
   competitive ability. Litter size had no significant influence on
   competitive ability. Our study also highlights how much remains unknown
   about the proximal causes of competitive ability.}},

Volume = {{43}},

Pages = {{161-167}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural traits that are consistent over time and in different
   contexts are often referred to as personality traits. These traits
   influence fitness because they play a major role in foraging,
   reproduction and survival, and so it is assumed that they have little or
   no additive genetic variance and, consequently, low heritability
   because, theoretically, they are under strong selection. Boldness and
   aggressiveness are two personality traits that have been shown to affect
   fitness. By crossing single males to multiple females, we estimated the
   heritability of boldness and aggressiveness in the zebrafish, Danio
   rerio. The additive genetic variance was statistically significant for
   both traits and the heritability estimates (95 \% confidence intervals)
   for boldness and aggressiveness were 0.76 (0.49, 0.90) and 0.36 (0.10,
   0.72) respectively. Furthermore, there were significant maternal effects
   accounting for 18 and 9 \% of the proportion of phenotypic variance in
   boldness and aggressiveness respectively. This study shows that there is
   a significant level of genetic variation in this population that would
   allow these traits to evolve in response to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Available experimental evidence suggests that there are genetic
   differences in the abilities of trees to compete for resources, in
   addition to non-genetic differences due to micro-site variation. The use
   of indirect genetic effects within the framework of linear mixed model
   methodology has been proposed for estimating genetic parameters and
   responses to selection in the presence of genetic competition. In this
   context, an individual's total breeding value reflects the effects of
   its direct breeding value on its own phenotype and its competitive
   breeding value on the phenotype of its neighbours. The present study
   used simulated data to investigate the relevance of accounting for
   competitive effects at the genetic and non-genetic levels in terms of
   the estimation of (co)variance components and selection response.
   Different experimental designs that resulted in different genetic
   relatedness levels within a neighbourhood and survival were other key
   issues examined. Variances estimated for additive genetic and residual
   effects tended to be biased under models that ignored genetic
   competition. Models that fitted competition at the genetic level only
   also resulted in biased (co)variance estimates for direct additive,
   competitive additive and residual effects. The ability to detect the
   correct model was reduced when relatedness within a neighbourhood was
   very low and survival decreased. Selection responses changed
   considerably between selecting on breeding value estimates from a model
   ignoring genetic competition and total breeding estimates using the
   correct model. Our results suggest that considering a genetic basis to
   competitive ability will be important to optimise selection programmes
   for genetic improvement of tree species.}},

Abstract = {{What are the targets of natural selection remains a controversial issue
   in Biology. Here I propose the ``Extended Fitness{''} hypothesis, in
   which extended phenotypes emerge as a link between individual and group
   selection. The basic premise of the extended fitness hypothesis is that
   extended phenotypes can be used by members of the same group since they
   are adapted to use them. Thus, extended phenotypes can also contribute
   to the fitness of members of the same species. Group selection emerges
   as a natural consequence of the shared use of extended phenotypes, which
   allow the evolutionary forces acting on individuals to become effective
   at the group level. The extended fitness hypothesis is supported by
   several observations found in nature. The hypothesis presented here
   provides a theoretical framework for the design of both modeling and
   experimental approaches to studying the role of extended phenotypes in
   group selection.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},

Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{569-578}},
Abstract = {{The role of female sex pheromones in natural selection, particularly as
   a means for species recognition to avoid the generation of hybrid
   offspring with low fitness, has been widely explored and is generally
   accepted by scholars. However, the significance of sex pheromones in
   shaping mate choice (sexual selection) and in competition over breeding
   resources (social selection) has been largely ignored. The effect of
   sexual selection on sex pheromones as a sexually dimorphic signaling
   trait has been discounted because the amount of pheromone released by
   females is typically minute, while the role of sex pheromones in
   competition over breeding resources (other than mates) has not yet been
   considered. As a result of natural selection, variation in sex
   pheromones among females is expected to be low, and males are not
   expected to choose their mates among pheromone-releasing conspecific
   females. Sexual selection, on the other hand, should drive the increase
   in pheromone variance among females, and males are expected to choose
   females based on this variation. Moreover, social selection resulting
   from more general social interactions, for example competition among
   females for breeding sites and food, should also promote variance among
   female sex pheromones. Here, we review the current evidence for each of
   the three selection processes acting on sex pheromones of female moths
   as an advertising trait. We suggest that the three selection types are
   not mutually exclusive but rather act together to promote different
   fitness components in diverse ecological situations.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are heritable effects of individuals on
   trait values of their conspecifics. IGEs may substantially affect
   response to selection, but empirical studies on IGEs are sparse and
   their magnitude and correlation with direct genetic effects are largely
   unknown in plants.
   Here we used linear mixed models to estimate genetic (co) variances
   attributable to direct and indirect effects for growth and foliar
   disease damage in a large pedigreed population of Eucalyptus globulus.
   We found significant IGEs for growth and disease damage, which increased
   with age for growth. The correlation between direct and indirect genetic
   effects was highly negative for growth, but highly positive for disease
   damage, consistent with neighbour competition and infection,
   respectively. IGEs increased heritable variation by 71\% for disease
   damage, but reduced heritable variation by 85\% for growth, leaving
   nonsignificant heritable variation for later age growth. Thus, IGEs are
   likely to prevent response to selection in growth, despite a
   considerable ordinary heritability.
   IGEs change our perspective on the genetic architecture and potential
   response to selection. Depending on the correlation between direct and
   indirect genetic effects, IGEs may enhance or diminish the response to
   natural or artificial selection compared with that predicted from
   ordinary heritability.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic studies of social behaviour have currently received new impetus
   from models including indirect genetic effects (IGEs) of social
   partners. This study aimed at investigating the contribution of
   conspecifics in social dominance, considered as response of dyadic
   interaction that is, winning (dominant individual) or losing
   (subordinate). A genetic correlation of -1 is expected between the
   attitude to win and the attitude to loose, and because a population
   always accounts for half winners and half losers, the heritability of
   the dominant status should be close to zero. Specifically, social
   dominance was studied in Aosta Chestnut and Aosta Black Pied (Bos
   taurus) breeds, alpine rustic cattle famous for traditional tournaments
   where pairs of cows assess dominant status in bloodless fights. The
   outcomes of 25 590 dyadic interactions performed by 8159 individuals in
   11 years were analysed by applying a classical quantitative model and
   models including indirect effects. Data were analysed via Bayesian
   approach on a threshold trait. The assessment of variances revealed a
   genetic correlation of -0.976 between direct and indirect genetic
   components. The heritability measured on a liability scale was 0.122 for
   direct phenotype, but decreased to 0.014 when the total heritable
   variance (TBV) was considered. The trend of estimated breeding values
   showed that the total TBV was constant over the years, even though its
   direct component increased and the indirect part decreased. This result
   confirms the relevance of IGEs on social behaviour and the assumption

Abstract = {{The widespread occurrence of female multiple mating (FMM) demands
   evolutionary explanation, particularly in the light of the costs of
   mating. One explanation encapsulated by good sperm and sexy-sperm
   (GS-SS) theoretical models is that FMM facilitates sperm competition,
   thus ensuring paternity by males that pass on genes for elevated sperm
   competitiveness to their male offspring. While support for this
   component of GS-SS theory is accumulating, a second but poorly tested
   assumption of these models is that there should be corresponding
   heritable genetic variation in FMM the proposed mechanism of
   postcopulatory preferences underlying GS-SS models. Here, we conduct
   quantitative genetic analyses on paternal half-siblings to test this
   component of GS-SS theory in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a
   freshwater fish with some of the highest known rates of FMM in
   vertebrates. As with most previous quantitative genetic analyses of FMM
   in other species, our results reveal high levels of phenotypic variation
   in this trait and a correspondingly low narrow-sense heritability
   (h2=0.11). Furthermore, although our analysis of additive genetic
   variance in FMM was not statistically significant (probably owing to
   limited statistical power), the ensuing estimate of mean-standardized
   additive genetic variance (IA=0.7) was nevertheless relatively low
   compared with estimates published for life-history traits across a broad
   range of taxa. Our results therefore add to a growing body of evidence
   that FMM is characterized by relatively low additive genetic variation,
   thus apparently contradicting GS-SS theory. However, we qualify this
   conclusion by drawing attention to potential deficiencies in most
   designs (including ours) that have tested for genetic variation in FMM,
   particularly those that fail to account for intersexual interactions
   that underlie FMM in many systems.}},

Abstract = {{Social structures such as families emerge as outcomes of behavioural
   interactions among individuals, and can evolve over time if families
   with particular types of social structures tend to leave more
   individuals in subsequent generations. The social behaviour of
   interacting individuals is typically analysed as a series of multiple
   dyadic (pair-wise) interactions, rather than a network of interactions
   among multiple individuals. However, in species where parents feed
   dependant young, interactions within families nearly always involve more
   than two individuals simultaneously. Such social networks of
   interactions at least partly reflect conflicts of interest over the
   provision of costly parental investment. Consequently, variation in
   family network structure reflects variation in how conflicts of interest
   are resolved among family members. Despite its importance in
   understanding the evolution of emergent properties of social
   organization such as family life and cooperation, nothing is currently
   known about how selection acts on the structure of social networks.
   Here, we show that the social network structure of broods of begging
   nestling great tits Parus major predicts fitness in families. Although
   selection at the level of the individual favours large nestlings,
   selection at the level of the kin-group primarily favours families that
   resolve conflicts most effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Pigs may affect each other's health, welfare and productivity through
   their behaviour. The effect of a pig on the growth rate of its pen mates
   is partly heritable and is referred to as its social genetic effect.
   Social genetic effects, also known as indirect genetic effects, have
   been found in a number of livestock breeds, in natural and laboratory
   populations, and in plant breeding and forestry, and have become an
   important research topic in recent years. In pigs, social genetic
   effects are hypothesized to be related to behaviour. The mechanism
   behind social genetic effects for growth, as well as the relationship
   between behaviours and growth itself, is largely unknown. To gain
   insight in the mechanism behind social genetic effects, we investigated
   the relationship between behaviours and growth rate in pigs. On a
   commercial pig farm, 398 finishing pigs in 50 pens (eight pigs/pen) were
   observed at 12 weeks of age using 2-min instantaneous scan sampling for
   6 h during daytime. For 324 observed pigs, growth rate during the
   finishing period was known. The relationship between behaviours and
   growth rate during the finishing period was analysed with behaviour as
   explanatory variable in a mixed model. Results show that time spent
   giving behaviours, like oral manipulation, social nosing, aggression and
   belly nosing, was not related to own growth rate. Receiving behaviours,
   however, did relate to growth. Pigs that received more oral
   manipulation, observed as tail biting, ear biting and paw biting, grew
   less well (P < 0.05). Growth rate was 43(+/- 17) g/d lower in pigs that
   received oral manipulation during more than 2\% of the observations as
   compared to pigs that did not receive oral manipulation. Pigs that
   received social nosing, a gentle touch or sniff at any part of the body,
   had a higher growth rate (P < 0.05): growth rate differed 29(+/- 17)0
   between pigs that received social nosing during more than 2\% of
   observations as compared to not receiving social nosing at all.
   Receiving aggression and belly nosing, a forceful rubbing of the belly,
   did not influence growth rate. In conclusion, receiving oral
   manipulation and social nosing related to growth rate. This suggests
   that pigs selected for positive social genetic effects for growth may
   potentially show behavioural changes. Effects of selection for social
   genetic effects on behaviour and growth will be studied in future
   research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Interactions among Individuals Affect Direct Genetic Effects}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Traditional quantitative genetics assumes that an individual's phenotype
   is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. For many
   animals, part of the environment is social and provided by parents and
   other interacting partners. When expression of genes in social partners
   affects trait expression in a focal individual, indirect genetic effects
   occur. In this study, we explore the effects of indirect genetic effects
   on the magnitude and range of phenotypic values in a focal individual in
   a multi-member model analyzing three possible classes of interactions
   between individuals. We show that social interactions may not only cause
   indirect genetic effects but can also modify direct genetic effects.
   Furthermore, we demonstrate that both direct and indirect genetic
   effects substantially alter the range of phenotypic values, particularly
   when a focal trait can influence its own expression via interactions
   with traits in other individuals. We derive a function predicting the
   relative importance of direct versus indirect genetic effects. Our model
   reveals that both direct and indirect genetic effects can depend to a
   large extent on both group size and interaction strength, altering group
   mean phenotype and variance. This may lead to scenarios where between
   group variation is much higher than within group variation despite
   similar underlying genetic properties, potentially affecting the level
   of selection. Our analysis highlights key properties of indirect genetic
   effects with important consequences for trait evolution, the level of
   selection and potentially speciation.}},

Abstract = {{The evolutionary forces that underlie polyandry, including extra-pair
   reproduction (EPR) by socially monogamous females, remain unclear.
   Selection on EPR and resulting evolution have rarely been explicitly
   estimated or predicted in wild populations, and evolutionary predictions
   are vulnerable to bias due to environmental covariances and correlated
   selection through unmeasured traits. However, evolutionary responses to
   (correlated) selection on any trait can be directly predicted as
   additive genetic covariances (cov(A)) with appropriate components of
   relative fitness. I used comprehensive life-history, paternity and
   pedigree data from song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to estimate cov(A)
   between a female's liability to produce extra-pair offspring and two
   specific fitness components: relative annual reproductive success (ARS)
   and survival to recruitment. All three traits showed non-zero additive
   genetic variance. Estimates of cov(A) were positive, predicting
   evolution towards increased EPR, but 95\% credible intervals overlapped
   zero. There was therefore no conclusive prediction of evolutionary
   change in EPR due to (correlated) selection through female ARS or
   recruitment. Negative environmental covariance between EPR and ARS would
   have impeded evolutionary prediction from phenotypic selection
   differentials. These analyses demonstrate an explicit quantitative
   genetic approach to predicting evolutionary responses to components of
   (correlated) selection on EPR that should be unbiased by environmental
   covariances and unmeasured traits.}},

Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{Mixed-species social aggregations are common across taxa. There are two,
   nonexclusive, hypotheses typically proposed to explain the formation of
   social groups: increased predator vigilance and greater foraging
   efficiency. In mixed-species groups, these hypotheses are typically
   tested with species-level summary measures such as flocking propensity,
   the assignment of species-level roles, mean body size, and foraging and
   habitat characteristics. Literature syntheses make it clear that while
   these hypotheses are important, much about mixed-species groups remains
   unexplained. We suggest that we can substantially increase our
   understanding of the evolution and ecology of mixed-species social
   groups in terms of both traditional and novel hypotheses by shifting the
   analytical focus to bottom-up approaches common in intraspecific
   investigations of sociality. Bottom-up approaches to analyses of social
   structure treat pairwise interactions as the fundamental unit of
   analysis and social structure as an emergent property rather than
   relying on a priori assignments of species as units of association. The
   construction of social networks from pairwise interaction rates allows
   us to assess the factors that promote group formation on the basis of
   individuals, a more appropriate level of selection, rather than species
   groups. We illustrate this approach with data from mixed-species
   foraging assemblies in tits (Paridae), finding significant effects of
   dominance on social behaviour within species. This new focus allows us
   to address questions about active associations among heterospecifics,
   the role of individuals within mixed-species societies, and the role of
   environments, which will collectively provide a richer description of
   the evolution and function of mixed-species societies. Crown Copyright

Abstract = {{Knowledge of how genetic effects arising from parental care influence
   the evolution of offspring traits comes almost exclusively from studies
   of maternal care. However, males provide care in some taxa, and often
   this care differs from females in quality or quantity. If variation in
   paternal care is genetically based then, like maternal care and maternal
   effects, paternal effects may have important consequences for the
   evolution of offspring traits via indirect genetic effects (IGEs). IGEs
   and directindirect genetic covariances associated with parental care can
   contribute substantially to total heritability and influence predictions
   about how traits respond to selection. It is unknown, however, if the
   magnitude and sign of parental effects arising from fathers are the same
   as those arising from mothers. We used a reciprocal cross-fostering
   experiment to quantify environmental and genetic effects of paternal
   care on offspring performance in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus
   vespilloides. We found that IGEs were substantial and direct-indirect
   genetic covariances were negative. Combined, these patterns led to low
   total heritabilities for offspring performance traits. Thus, under
   paternal care, offspring performance traits are unlikely to evolve in
   response to selection, and variation in these traits will be maintained
   in the population despite potentially strong selection on these traits.
   These patterns are similar to those generated by maternal care,
   indicating that the genetic effects of care on offspring performance are
   independent of the caregiver's sex.}},

   Here, we use a quantitative genetic model, including phenotypic
   plasticity and maternal effects, to suggest that the relationship
   between fitness and phenotypic variance plays an important role.
   Intuitive expectations that positive maternal effects are beneficial are
   supported following an extreme environmental shift, but, if too strong,
   that shift can also generate oscillatory dynamics that overshoot the
   optimal phenotype. In a stable environment, negative maternal effects
   that slow phenotypic evolution actually minimize variance around the
   optimum phenotype and thus maximize population mean fitness.}},

   These distinct approaches converge upon the observation that gene action
   at a distance generates feedback that expands the range of trait values
   and evolutionary rates that we should expect to observe in empirical
   studies. Such conceptual replication provides solid evidence that traits
   with extended effects have important evolutionary consequences, but more

Abstract = {{Through social interactions, individuals can affect one another's
   phenotype. The heritable effect of an individual on the phenotype of a
   conspecific is known as an indirect genetic effect (IGE). Although IGEs
   can have a substantial impact on heritable variation and response to
   selection, little is known about the genetic architecture of traits
   affected by IGEs. We studied IGEs for survival in domestic chickens
   (Gallus gallus), using data on two purebred lines and their reciprocal
   cross. Birds were kept in groups of four. Feather pecking and
   cannibalism caused mortality, as beaks were kept intact. Survival time
   was shorter in crossbreds than in purebreds, indicating outbreeding
   depression and the presence of nonadditive genetic effects. IGEs
   contributed the majority of heritable variation in crossbreds (87 and
   72\%) and around half of heritable variation in purebreds (65 and 44\%).
   There was no evidence of dominance variance, neither direct nor
   indirect. Absence of dominance variance in combination with considerable
   outbreeding depression suggests that survival is affected by many loci.
   Direct-indirect genetic correlations were moderately to highly negative
   in crossbreds (-0.37 +/- 0.17 and -0.83 +/- 0.10), but low and not
   significantly different from zero in purebreds (-0.20 +/- 0.21 and -0.28
   +/- 0.18). Consequently, unlike purebreds, crossbreds would fail to
   respond positively to mass selection. The direct genetic correlation
   between both crosses was high (0.95 +/- 0.23), whereas the indirect
   genetic correlation was moderate (0.41 +/- 0.26). Thus, for IGEs, it
   mattered which parental line provided the sire and which provided the
   dam. This indirect parent-of-origin effect appeared to be paternally
   transmitted and is probably Z chromosome linked.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals often show consistent differences in behavioural traits that
   may belong to a behavioural syndrome. Aggressive propensity is usually
   an important component of consistent behavioural types, potentially
   generating benefits in resource competition with conspecifics that may
   be traded off against costs in other contexts (e.g. acquisition of mates
   or coexistence with group members). Such trade-offs have not yet been
   studied in highly social species. We investigated how aggressive
   propensity influences competition for dominance, shelters and mates in
   the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. Following an
   established protocol we compared growth trajectories of groups of four
   fish either matched or unmatched for aggressive type. Furthermore, we
   analysed social interactions, the acquisition of shelter and possible
   mating partners (by proximity to shelters and prospective mates)
   according to aggressive type, showing either high or low aggression
   levels. Contrary to prediction we found that differences in behavioural
   idiosyncrasies affected the likelihood of obtaining the dominant
   position and high-quality territories only marginally. Social
   interactions, growth rates and body reserve accumulation were affected
   by behavioural differences. However, the patterns observed in this
   experiment differed from previous studies and suggest a modulating
   effect of the social environment on the link between behavioural types
   and life history decisions. Hence, we suggest that in future studies
   this relationship should be thoroughly investigated under varying social
   contexts, especially in highly social species. (C) 2012 The Association

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one
   individual affect the phenotype of a conspecific. Theoretical models
   indicate that the evolutionary consequences of IGEs critically depend on
   the genetic architecture of interacting traits, and on the strength and
   direction of phenotypic effects arising from social interactions, which
   can be quantified by the interaction coefficient Psi. In the context of
   sexually selected traits, strong positive Psi tends to exaggerate
   evolutionary change, whereas negative Psi impedes sexual trait
   elaboration. Despite its theoretical importance, whether and how Psi
   varies among geographically distinct populations is unknown. Such
   information is necessary to evaluate the potential for IGEs to
   contribute to divergence among isolated or semi-isolated populations.
   Here, we report substantial variation in Psi for a behavioural trait
   involved in sexual selection in the field cricket Teleogryllus
   oceanicus: female choosiness. Both the strength and direction of Psi
   varied among geographically isolated populations. Psi also changed over
   time. In a contemporary population of crickets from Kauai, experience of
   male song increased female choosiness. In contrast, experience of male
   song decreased choosiness in an ancestral population from the same
   location. This rapid change corroborates studies examining the
   evolvability of Psi and demonstrates how interpopulation variation in
   the interaction coefficient might influence sexual selection and
   accelerate divergence of traits influenced by IGEs that contribute to
   reproductive isolation in nascent species or subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{Behaviors toward heterospecifics and conspecifics may be correlated
   because of shared mechanisms of expression in both social contexts
   (nonadaptive covariation) or because correlational selection favors
   adaptive covariation. We evaluated these hypotheses by comparing
   behavior toward conspecifics and heterospecifics in brook stickleback
   (Culaea inconstans) from three populations sympatric with and three
   allopatric from a competitor, the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius
   pungitius). Behavioral traits were classified into three multivariate
   components: overt aggression, sociability, and activity. The correlation
   of behavior between social contexts for both overt aggression and
   activity varied among populations in a way unrelated to sympatry with
   ninespine stickleback, while mean aggression was reduced in sympatry.
   Correlations in allopatric populations suggest that overt aggression and
   activity may genetically covary between social contexts for nonadaptive
   reasons. Sociability was rarely correlated in allopatry but was
   consistently correlated in sympatry despite reduced mean sociability,
   suggesting that correlational selection may favor a sociability syndrome
   in brook stickleback when they coexist with ninespine stickleback. Thus,
   interspecific competition may impose diversifying selection on behavior
   among populations, although the causes of correlated behavior toward
   conspecifics and heterospecifics and whether it can evolve in one social
   context independent of the other may depend on the type of behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual variation in behaviour is widespread across taxa
   and behavioural categories. Because social behaviour is often a plastic
   response to the social environment, consistent variation in social
   behaviours such as aggression and cooperation may generate consistent
   variation in the behaviour of social partners and others in the group.
   In this study, we moved individual subordinate males between groups of a
   cooperatively breeding cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher. We found that
   subordinate males varied consistently in their aggressive interactions
   with neighbouring fish. The effects of individual subordinate males
   extended beyond their direct interactions; agonistic interactions
   between dominant males and dominant females varied consistently with
   subordinate male identity. We suggest that variation in helping
   behaviour through territorial defence influences the net fitness effects
   of subordinate males on dominant males and, thus, the potential for
   conflict between dominant males and dominant females over subordinate
   male presence. The existence of indirect phenotypic effects of
   subordinate males on interactions not directly involving the subordinate
   male suggests that individual personalities extend into the social
   environment and may be an important selective influence on social
   behaviour and on variation among social groups. (C) 2012 The Association

Abstract = {{Female mating preferences are often flexible, reflecting the social
   environment in which they are expressed. Associated indirect genetic
   effects (IGEs) can affect the rate and direction of evolutionary change,
   but sexual selection models do not capture these dynamics. We
   incorporate IGEs into quantitative genetic models to explore how
   variation in social environments and mate choice flexibility influence
   Fisherian sexual selection. The importance of IGEs is that runaway
   sexual selection can occur in the absence of a genetic correlation
   between male traits and female preferences. Social influences can
   facilitate the initiation of the runaway process and increase the rate
   of trait elaboration. Incorporating costs to choice do not alter the
   main findings. Our model provides testable predictions: (1) genetic
   covariances between male traits and female preferences may not exist,
   (2) social flexibility in female choice will be common in populations
   experiencing strong sexual selection, (3) variation in social
   environments should be associated with rapid sexual trait divergence,
   and (4) secondary sexual traits will be more elaborate than previously
   predicted. Allowing feedback from the social environment resolves
   discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical data, such
   as why indirect selection on female preferences, theoretically weak,
   might be sufficient for preferences to become elaborated.}},

Abstract = {{Social selection influences the evolution of weapons, ornaments and
   behaviour in both males and females. Thus, social interactions in both
   sexual and non-sexual contexts can have a powerful influence on the
   evolution of traits that would otherwise appear to be detrimental to
   survival. Although clearly outlined by West-Eberhard in the early 1980s,
   the idea that social selection is a comprehensive framework for the
   study of ornaments and weapons has largely been ignored. In
   West-Eberhard's view, sexual selection is a form of social selection-a
   concept supported by several lines of evidence. Darwin's distinction
   between natural and sexual selection has been useful, but recent
   confusion about the limits of sexual selection suggests that some traits
   are not easily categorized as naturally or sexually selected. Because
   social selection theory has much to offer the current debates about both
   sexual selection and reproductive competition in females, it is
   sometimes viewed, narrowly, to be most useful when considering female
   roles. However, social selection theory encompasses much more than
   female reproductive competition. Our goal here was to provide that
   broader perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Ornaments, weapons and aggressive behaviours may evolve in female
   animals by mate choice and intrasexual competition for mating
   opportunities-the standard forms of sexual selection in males. However,
   a growing body of evidence suggests that selection tends to operate in
   different ways in males and females, with female traits more often
   mediating competition for ecological resources, rather than mate
   acquisition. Two main solutions have been proposed to accommodate this
   disparity. One is to expand the concept of sexual selection to include
   all mechanisms related to fecundity; another is to adopt an alternative
   conceptual framework-the theory of social selection-in which sexual
   selection is one component of a more general form of selection resulting
   from all social interactions. In this study, we summarize the history of
   the debate about female ornaments and weapons, and discuss potential
   resolutions. We review the components of fitness driving ornamentation
   in a wide range of systems, and show that selection often falls outside
   the limits of traditional sexual selection theory, particularly in
   females. We conclude that the evolution of these traits in both sexes is
   best understood within the unifying framework of social selection.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the evolution of altruism requires knowledge of both its
   constraints and its drivers. Here we show that, paradoxically,
   ecological constraints on altruism may ultimately be its strongest
   driver. We construct a two-trait, coevolutionary adaptive dynamics model
   of social evolution in a genetically structured population with local
   resource competition. The intensity of local resource competition, which
   influences the direction and strength of social selection and which is
   typically treated as a static parameter, is here allowed to be an
   evolvable trait. Evolution of survival/fecundity altruism, which
   requires weak local competition, increases local competition as it
   evolves, creating negative environmental feedback that ultimately
   inhibits its further evolutionary advance. Alternatively, evolution of
   resource-based altruism, which requires strong local competition,
   weakens local competition as it evolves, also ultimately causing its own
   evolution to stall. When evolving independently, these altruistic
   strategies are intrinsically self-limiting. However, the coexistence of
   these two altruism types transforms the negative ecoevolutionary
   feedback generated by each strategy on itself into positive feedback on
   the other, allowing the presence of one trait to drive the evolution of
   the other. We call this feedback conversion reciprocal niche
   construction. In the absence of constraints, this process leads to
   runaway coevolution of altruism types. We discuss applications to the
   origins and evolution of eusociality, division of labor, the inordinate
   ecological success of eusocial species, and the interaction between
   technology and demography in human evolution. Our theory suggests that
   the evolution of extreme sociality may often be an autocatalytic
   process.}},

Abstract = {{In many traits involved in social interactions, such as courtship and
   aggression, the phenotype is an outcome of interactions between
   individuals. Such traits whose expression in an individual is partly
   determined by the phenotype of its social partner are called interacting
   phenotypes. Quantitative genetic models suggested that interacting
   phenotypes can evolve much faster than nonsocial traits. Current models,
   however, consider the interaction between phenotypes of social partners
   as a fixed phenotypic response rule, represented by an interaction
   coefficient (?). Here, we extend existing theoretical models and
   incorporate the interaction coefficient as a trait that can evolve. We
   find that the evolution of the interaction coefficient can change
   qualitatively the predictions about the rate and direction of evolution
   of interacting phenotypes. We argue that it is crucial to determine
   whether and how the phenotypic response of an individual to its social
   partner can evolve to make accurate predictions about the evolution of
   traits involved in social interactions.}},

Title = {{Indirect Genetic Effects and the Spread of Infectious Disease: Are We
   Capturing the Full Heritable Variation Underlying Disease Prevalence?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 29}},
Abstract = {{Reducing disease prevalence through selection for host resistance offers
   a desirable alternative to chemical treatment. Selection for host
   resistance has proven difficult, however, due to low heritability
   estimates. These low estimates may be caused by a failure to capture all
   the relevant genetic variance in disease resistance, as genetic analysis
   currently is not taylored to estimate genetic variation in infectivity.
   Host infectivity is the propensity of transmitting infection upon
   contact with a susceptible individual, and can be regarded as an
   indirect effect to disease status. It may be caused by a combination of
   physiological and behavioural traits. Though genetic variation in
   infectivity is difficult to measure directly, Indirect Genetic Effect
   (IGE) models, also referred to as associative effects or social
   interaction models, allow the estimation of this variance from more
   readily available binary disease data (infected/non-infected). We
   therefore generated binary disease data from simulated populations with
   known amounts of variation in susceptibility and infectivity to test the
   adequacy of traditional and IGE models. Our results show that a
   conventional model fails to capture the genetic variation in infectivity
   inherent in populations with simulated infectivity. An IGE model, on the
   other hand, does capture some of the variation in infectivity.
   Comparison with expected genetic variance suggests that there is scope
   for further methodological improvement, and that potential responses to
   selection may be greater than values presented here. Nonetheless,
   selection using an index of estimated direct and indirect breeding
   values was shown to have a greater genetic selection differential and
   reduced future disease risk than traditional selection for resistance
   only. These findings suggest that if genetic variation in infectivity
   substantially contributes to disease transmission, then breeding designs
   which explicitly incorporate IGEs might help reduce disease prevalence.}},

Abstract = {{In Drosophila melanogaster, biological rhythms, aggression and mating
   are modulated by group size and composition. However, the fitness
   significance of this group effect is unknown. By varying the composition
   of groups of males and females, we show that social context affects
   reproductive behaviour and offspring genetic diversity. Firstly, females
   mating with males from the same strain in the presence of males from a
   different strain are infecund, analogous to the Bruce effect in rodents,
   suggesting a social context-dependent inbreeding avoidance mechanism.
   Secondly, females mate more frequently in groups composed of males from
   more than one strain; this mitigates last male sperm precedence and
   increases offspring genetic diversity. However, smell-impaired Orco
   mutant females do not increase mating frequency according to group
   composition; this indicates that social context-dependent changes in
   reproductive behaviour depend on female olfaction, rather than direct
   male-male interactions. Further, variation in mating frequency in
   wild-type strains depends on females and not males. The data show that
   group composition can affect variance in the reproductive success of its
   members, and that females play a central role in this process. Social
   environment can thus influence the evolutionary process.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships among the members of a population can be visualized
   using individual networks, where each individual is a node connected to
   each other by means of links describing the interactions. The centrality
   of a given node captures its importance within the network. We
   hypothesize that in mutualistic networks, the centrality of a node
   should benefit its fitness. We test this idea studying eight
   individual-based networks originated from the interaction between
   Erysimum mediohispanicum and its flower visitors. In these networks,
   each plant was considered a node and was connected to conspecifics
   sharing flower visitors. Centrality indicates how well connected is a
   given E. mediohispanicum individual with the rest of the co-occurring
   conspecifics because of sharing flower visitors. The centrality was
   estimated by three network metrics: betweenness, closeness and degree.
   The complex relationship between centrality, phenotype and fitness was
   explored by structural equation modelling. We found that the centrality
   of a plant was related to its fitness, with plants occupying central
   positions having higher fitness than those occupying peripheral
   positions. The structural equation models (SEMs) indicated that the
   centrality effect on fitness was not merely an effect of the abundance
   of visits and the species richness of visitors. Centrality has an effect
   even when simultaneously accounting for these predictors. The SEMs also
   indicated that the centrality effect on fitness was because of the
   specific phenotype of each plant, with attractive plants occupying
   central positions in networks, in relation to the distribution of
   conspecific phenotypes. This finding suggests that centrality, owing to
   its dependence on social interactions, may be an appropriate surrogate
   for the interacting phenotype of individuals.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Great progress has been made in understanding the genetic architecture
   of phenotypic variation, but it is almost entirely focused on how the
   genotype of an individual affects the phenotype of that same individual.
   However, in many species the genotype of the mother is a major
   determinant of the phenotype of her offspring. Therefore, a complete
   picture of genetic architecture must include these maternal genetic
   effects, but they can be difficult to identify because maternal and
   offspring genotypes are correlated and therefore, partially confounded.
   We present a conceptual framework that overcomes this challenge to
   separate direct and maternal effects in intact families through an
   analysis that we call ``statistical cross-fostering.{''} Our approach
   combines genotype data from mothers and their offspring to remove the
   confounding effects of the offspring's own genotype on measures of
   maternal genetic effects. We formalize our approach in an orthogonal
   model and apply this model to an experimental population of mice. We
   identify a set of six maternal genetic effect loci that explain a
   substantial portion of variation in body size at all ages. This
   variation would be missed in an approach focused solely on direct
   genetic effects, but is clearly a major component of genetic
   architecture. Our approach can easily be adapted to examine maternal
   effects in different systems, and because it does not require
   experimental manipulation, it provides a framework that can be used to
   understand the contribution of maternal genetic effects in both natural
   and experimental populations.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution and development of complex phenotypes in social insect
   colonies, such as queenworker dimorphism or division of labor, can, in
   our opinion, only be fully understood within an expanded mechanistic
   framework of Developmental Evolution. Conversely, social insects offer a
   fertile research area in which fundamental questions of Developmental
   Evolution can be addressed empirically. We review the concept of gene
   regulatory networks (GRNs) that aims to fully describe the battery of
   interacting genomic modules that are differentially expressed during the
   development of individual organisms. We discuss how distinct types of
   network models have been used to study different levels of biological
   organization in social insects, from GRNs to social networks. We propose
   that these hierarchical networks spanning different organizational
   levels from genes to societies should be integrated and incorporated
   into full GRN models to elucidate the evolutionary and developmental
   mechanisms underlying social insect phenotypes. Finally, we discuss
   prospects and approaches to achieve such an integration. J. Exp. Zool.

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection arises from social interactions, and if social
   environments vary so too should sexual selection. For example, malemale
   competition often occurs either in the presence or in the absence of
   females, and such changes in the social environment could affect the
   form and strength of sexual selection. Here we examine how the presence
   of a female influences selection arising from malemale competition in a
   leaf-footed cactus bug, Narnia femorata, which has a resource defence
   mating system. Males compete for territories on cacti because females
   lay eggs on the cactus plants. Females are not always present when this
   competition first occurs; however, the presence or absence of the female
   matters. We found that both the form and strength of selection on male
   traits, those traits that influenced success in intrasexual competition,
   depended on the social context. When a female was not present, male size
   and the area of the sexually dimorphic hind legs was only marginally
   important to winning a contest. However, males with larger overall size
   and leg area were more likely to win in the presence of a female. There
   was also positive quadratic selection on these traits when a female was
   present with both the largest and the smallest males winning. The
   implication is unexpected alternative strategies when females are
   present. Our results support the notion that sexual selection should be
   studied under all relevant social contexts.}},

Title = {{Can number and size of offspring increase simultaneously? - a central
   life-history trade-off reconsidered}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: To maximize their fitness, parents are assumed to allocate
   their resources optimally between number and size of offspring. Although
   this fundamental life-history trade-off has been subject to long
   standing interest, its genetic basis, especially in wild mammals, still
   remains unresolved. One important reason for this problem is that a
   large multigenerational pedigree is required to conduct a reliable
   analysis of this trade-off.
   Results: We used the REML-animal model to estimate genetic parameters
   for litter size and individual birth size for a common Palearctic small
   mammal, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Even though a phenotypic
   trade-off between offspring number and size was evident, it was not
   explained by a genetic trade-off, but rather by negative correlations in
   permanent and temporary environmental effects. In fact, even positive
   genetic correlations were estimated between direct genetic effects for
   offspring number and size indicating that genetic variation in these two
   traits is not necessarily antagonistic in mammals.
   Conclusions: Our results have notable implications for the study of the
   life-history trade-off between offspring number and size in mammals. The
   estimated genetic correlations suggest that evolution of offspring
   number and size in polytocous mammals is not constrained by the
   trade-off caused by antagonistic selection responses per se, but rather
   by the opposing correlative selection responses in direct and maternal
   genetic effects for birth size.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{890-895}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions have a powerful effect on the evolutionary process.
   Recent attempts to synthesize models of social selection with equations
   for indirect genetic effects (McGlothlin et al. 2010) provide a broad
   theoretical base from which to study selection and evolutionary response
   in the context of social interactions. However, this framework concludes
   that social selection will lead to evolution only if the traits carried
   by social partners are nonrandomly associated. I suggest this conclusion
   is incomplete, and that traits that do not covary between social
   partners can nevertheless lead to evolution via interactive effects on
   fitness. Such effects occur when there are functional interactions
   between traits, and as an example I use the interplay in water striders
   (Gerridae) between grasping appendages carried by males and spines by
   females. Functional interactive effects between traits can be
   incorporated into both the equations for social selection and the
   general model of social evolution proposed by McGlothlin et al. These
   expanded equations would accommodate adaptive coevolution in social
   interactions, integrate the quantitative genetic approach to social
   evolution with game theoretical approaches, and stimulate some new
   questions about the process of social evolution.}},

Title = {{Mixing of Honeybees with Different Genotypes Affects Individual Worker
   Behavior and Transcription of Genes in the Neuronal Substrate}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Division of labor in social insects has made the evolution of collective
   traits possible that cannot be achieved by individuals alone.
   Differences in behavioral responses produce variation in engagement in
   behavioral tasks, which as a consequence, generates a division of labor.
   We still have little understanding of the genetic components influencing
   these behaviors, although several candidate genomic regions and genes
   influencing individual behavior have been identified. Here, we report
   that mixing of worker honeybees with different genotypes influences the
   expression of individual worker behaviors and the transcription of genes
   in the neuronal substrate. These indirect genetic effects arise in a
   colony because numerous interactions between workers produce interacting
   phenotypes and genotypes across organisms. We studied hygienic behavior
   of honeybee workers, which involves the cleaning of diseased brood cells
   in the colony. We mixed,500 newly emerged honeybee workers with
   genotypes of preferred Low (L) and High (H) hygienic behaviors. The L/H
   genotypic mixing affected the behavioral engagement of L worker bees in
   a hygienic task, the cooperation among workers in uncapping single brood
   cells, and switching between hygienic tasks. We found no evidence that
   recruiting and task-related stimuli are the primary source of the
   indirect genetic effects on behavior. We suggested that behavioral
   responsiveness of L bees was affected by genotypic mixing and found
   evidence for changes in the brain in terms of 943 differently expressed
   genes. The functional categories of cell adhesion, cellular component
   organization, anatomical structure development, protein localization,
   developmental growth and cell morphogenesis were overrepresented in this
   set of 943 genes, suggesting that indirect genetic effects can play a
   role in modulating and modifying the neuronal substrate. Our results
   suggest that genotypes of social partners affect the behavioral
   responsiveness and the neuronal substrate of individual workers,
   indicating a complex genetic architecture underlying the expression of
   behavior.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Habitat selection is an important decision in the life histories of many
   animals and has implications for many issues in ecology, evolution and
   conservation biology. Natal experiences may shape adult habitat
   selection behaviours, but the effects of natal social environment on
   these decisions are largely unknown. Here we provide an experimental
   test of the effects of natal social experience on adult habitat
   selection in the cactus bug, Chelinidea vittiger (Hemiptera: Coreidae).
   We found that females reared in groups were more likely to forage
   socially as adults than females that were reared alone; however, males
   consistently avoided joining conspecifics regardless of natal social
   experience. Our work reveals that cues gathered early in life can have
   effects that extend across life stages to influence adult habitat
   selection and social behaviours. Furthermore, the discovery of these
   patterns in a subsocial invertebrate demonstrates that adult
   responsiveness to natal social conditions is not restricted to highly
   social species, and may be common across taxa. (C) 2011 The Association

Abstract = {{An unresolved controversy regarding social behaviors is exemplified when
   natural selection might lead to behaviors that maximize fitness at the
   social-group level but are costly at the individual level. Except for
   the special case of groups of clones, we do not have a general
   understanding of how and when group-optimal behaviors evolve, especially
   when the behaviors in question are flexible. To address this question,
   we develop a general model that integrates behavioral plasticity in
   social interactions with the action of natural selection in structured
   populations. We find that group-optimal behaviors can evolve, even
   without clonal groups, if individuals exhibit appropriate behavioral
   responses to each other's actions. The evolution of such behavioral
   responses, in turn, is predicated on the nature of the proximate
   behavioral mechanisms. We model a particular class of proximate
   mechanisms, prosocial preferences, and find that such preferences evolve
   to sustain maximum group benefit under certain levels of relatedness and
   certain ecological conditions. Thus, our model demonstrates the
   fundamental interplay between behavioral responses and relatedness in
   determining the course of social evolution. We also highlight the
   crucial role of proximate mechanisms such as prosocial preferences in
   the evolution of behavioral responses and in facilitating evolutionary
   transitions in individuality.}},

Abstract = {{Life-history theory predicts that individuals should adjust their
   reproductive effort according to the expected fitness returns on
   investment. Because sexually selected male traits should provide honest
   information about male genetic or phenotypic quality, females may invest
   more when paired with attractive males. However, there is substantial
   disagreement in the literature whether such differential allocation is a
   general pattern. Using a comparative meta-regression approach, we show
   that female birds generally invest more into reproduction when paired
   with attractive males, both in terms of egg size and number as well as
   food provisioning. However, whereas females of species with bi-parental
   care tend to primarily increase the number of eggs when paired with
   attractive males, females of species with female-only care produce
   larger, but not more, eggs. These patterns may reflect adaptive
   differences in female allocation strategies arising from variation in
   the signal content of sexually selected male traits between systems of
   parental care. In contrast to reproductive effort, female allocation of
   immune-stimulants, anti-oxidants and androgens to the egg yolk was not
   consistently increased when mated to attractive males, which probably
   reflects the context-dependent costs and benefits of those yolk
   compounds to females and offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of heritability and genetic correlations are of central
   importance in the study of adaptive trait evolution and genetic
   constraints. We use a paternal half-sib-full-sib breeding design to
   investigate the genetic architecture of three life-history and
   morphological traits in the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus.
   Heritability was significant for all traits under observation and
   genetic correlations between traits (r(A)) were low. Interestingly, we
   found substantial sex-specific genetic effects and low genetic
   correlations between sexes (r(MF)) in traits that are only moderately
   (weight at emergence) to slightly (longevity) sexually dimorphic.
   Furthermore, we found an increased sire (s(sire)(2)) compared to
   dam(s(dam)(2)) variance component within trait and sex. Our results
   highlight that the genetic architecture even of the same trait should
   not be assumed to be the same for males and females. Furthermore, it
   raises the issue of the presence of unnoticed environmental effects that
   may inflate estimates of heritability. Overall, our study stresses the
   fact that estimates of quantitative genetic parameters are not only
   population, time, environment, but also sex specific. Thus,
   extrapolation between sexes and studies should be treated with caution.}},

Abstract = {{Many animal species exhibit behavioural syndromes, groups of two or more

   profiles and have been likened to personality in humans. However, the
   proximate causes (or mechanisms) that underlie the clustering of

   proximate causes of the aggression-boldness behavioural syndrome, which
   constitutes a positive correlation between aggression, boldness and
   exploratory activity. In particular, we will focus on novel insights
   that have been gained from zebrafish, a genetically tractable
   behavioural model which can be used to study the mechanistic basis of
   behaviour. Studies of the proximate causes of behavioural syndromes
   provide us with the opportunity to understand the clustering of
   behaviours - and perhaps even the basis of personality - at the

   novel insights into animal behaviour, but also forces us to rethink our

Abstract = {{Aggression mediates competition for food, mating partners, and habitats
   and, among social animals, establishes stable dominance hierarchies. In
   humans, abnormal aggression is a hallmark of neuropsychiatric disorders
   and can be elicited by environmental factors acting on an underlying
   genetic susceptibility. Identifying the genetic architecture that
   predisposes to aggressive behavior in people is challenging because of
   difficulties in quantifying the phenotype, genetic heterogeneity, and
   uncontrolled environmental conditions. Studies on mice have identified
   single-gene mutations that result in hyperaggression, contingent on
   genetic background. These studies can be complemented by systems
   genetics approaches in Drosophila melanogaster, in which mutational
   analyses together with genome-wide transcript analyses, artificial
   selection studies, and genome-wide analysis of epistasis have revealed
   that a large segment of the genome contributes to the manifestation of
   aggressive behavior with widespread epistatic interactions. Comparative
   genomic analyses based on the principle of evolutionary conservation are
   needed to enable a complete dissection of the neurogenetic underpinnings
   of this universal fitness trait.}},

Abstract = {{In the natural world, interactions between individuals occur in groups:

   to affect behavior across the group. Such feedback has been observed in
   Drosophila melanogaster, for example, when mating frequency increases in
   groups composed of mixed strains compared to homogenous groups (Krupp et
   al., 2008 and Billeter et al. 2012). A working hypothesis is that social
   processes-to recognize, identify, discriminate, and engage-are innate.
   They rely on a combination of genetic inheritance, molecular
   interactions, and cell circuitry that produce neural and immunological
   responses. Here, we discuss studies that emphasize social interactions
   in four categories in Drosophila melanogaster: learning, circadian
   clocks, aggression, and mating. We also speculate that a systems-level
   network approach to the study of Drosophila groups will be instrumental
   in understanding the genetic basis of emergent group-level behavior. (C)

Abstract = {{In hostsymbiont interactions, the genes of both host and symbiont can
   influence phenotypic traits. In the context of a conflict of interest,
   fitness-related traits are subjected to opposing selective pressures in
   the genomes of the partners. In the Drosophila parasitoid Leptopilina
   boulardi, females usually avoid laying eggs into already parasitized
   larvae. However, when infected by the virus LbFV, they readily lay
   additional eggs into parasitized larvae. Inducing superparasitism allows
   the virus to colonize uninfected parasitoid lineages but is usually
   maladaptive for the parasitoid. We tested for the presence of resistance
   genes to this behavioural manipulation in the parasitoid genotype by
   sampling 30 lines from five populations with contrasting viral
   prevalence, after infecting them with a reference viral isolate. No
   geographical differentiation was observed although some genotypes
   underwent less manipulation than others, and these differences were
   heritable across generations. The viral titre was not correlated with
   these differences although fecundity differed between extreme lines.}},

Abstract = {{Social networks describe the pattern of intraspecific interactions

   is expected to influence its fitness, but only a few studies have
   examined this relationship in natural populations. We investigated the
   fitness consequences of network position in a wild beetle population.
   Copulation success of male beetles positively covaried with strength (a
   measure of network centrality) and negatively covaried with clustering
   coefficient (CC) (a measure of cliquishness). Further analysis using
   mediation path models suggested that the activity level of individuals
   drove the relationships between strength and fitness almost entirely. In
   contrast, selection on CC was not explained by individual behaviours.
   Although our data suggest that social network position can experience
   strong sexual selection, it is also clear that the relationships between
   fitness and some network metrics merely reflect variation in

Pages = {{1-19}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In a model based on the wasp family Vespidae, the origin of worker
   behaviour, which constitutes the eusociality threshold, is not based on
   relatedness, therefore the origin of eusociality does not depend on
   inclusive fitness, and workers at the eusociality threshold are not
   altruistic. Instead, incipient workers and queens behave selfishly and
   are subject to direct natural selection. Beyond the eusociality
   threshold, relatedness enables soft inheritance as the framework for
   initial adaptations of eusociality. At the threshold of irreversibility,
   queen and worker castes become fixed in advanced eusociality.
   Transitions from solitary to facultative, facultative to primitive, and
   primitive to advanced eusociality occur via exaptation, phenotypic
   accommodation and genetic assimilation. Multilevel selection
   characterizes the solitary to highly eusocial transition, but components
   of multilevel selection vary across levels of eusociality. Roles of

Abstract = {{Genetic selection is a major force shaping life on earth. In classical
   genetic theory, response to selection is the product of the strength of
   selection and the additive genetic variance in a trait. The additive
   genetic variance reflects a population's intrinsic potential to respond
   to selection. The ordinary additive genetic variance, however, ignores
   the social organization of life. With social interactions among
   individuals, individual trait values may depend on genes in others, a
   phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects. Models accounting for
   indirect genetic effects, however, lack a general definition of
   heritable variation. Here I propose a general definition of the
   heritable variation that determines the potential of a population to
   respond to selection. This generalizes the concept of heritable variance
   to any inheritance model and level of organization. The result shows
   that heritable variance determining potential response to selection is
   the variance among individuals in the heritable quantity that determines
   the population mean trait value, rather than the usual additive genetic
   component of phenotypic variance. It follows, therefore, that heritable
   variance may exceed phenotypic variance among individuals, which is
   impossible in classical theory. This work also provides a measure of the
   utilization of heritable variation for response to selection and
   integrates two well-known models of maternal genetic effects. The result
   shows that relatedness between the focal individual and the individuals
   affecting its fitness is a key determinant of the utilization of
   heritable variance for response to selection.}},

   Aggressiveness in the Green Swordtail Xiphophorus helleri}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Aggression occurs when individuals compete over limiting resources.
   While theoretical studies have long placed a strong emphasis on
   context-specificity of aggression, there is increasing recognition that
   consistent behavioural differences exist among individuals, and that
   aggressiveness may be an important component of individual personality.
   Though empirical studies tend to focus on one aspect or the other, we
   suggest there is merit in modelling both within-and among-individual
   variation in agonistic behaviour simultaneously. Here, we demonstrate
   how this can be achieved using multivariate linear mixed effect models.
   Using data from repeated mirror trials and dyadic interactions of male
   green swordtails, Xiphophorus helleri, we show repeatable components of
   (co)variation in a suite of agonistic behaviour that is broadly
   consistent with a major axis of variation in aggressiveness. We also
   show that observed focal behaviour is dependent on opponent effects,
   which can themselves be repeatable but were more generally found to be
   context specific. In particular, our models show that within-individual
   variation in agonistic behaviour is explained, at least in part, by the
   relative size of a live opponent as predicted by contest theory.
   Finally, we suggest several additional applications of the multivariate
   models demonstrated here. These include testing the recently queried
   functional equivalence of alternative experimental approaches, (e. g.,
   mirror trials, dyadic interaction tests) for assaying individual
   aggressiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Mothers are often the most important determinant of traits expressed by
   their offspring. These ``maternal effects{''} (MEs) are especially
   crucial in early development, but can also persist into adulthood. They
   have been shown to play a role in a diversity of evolutionary and
   ecological processes, especially when genetically based. Although the
   importance of MEs is becoming widely appreciated, we know little about
   their underlying genetic basis. We address the dearth of genetic data by
   providing a simple approach, using combined genotype information from
   parents and offspring, to identify ``maternal genetic effects{''} (MGEs)
   contributing to natural variation in complex traits. Combined with
   experimental cross-fostering, our approach also allows for the
   separation of pre- and postnatal MGEs, providing rare insights into
   prenatal effects. Applying this approach to an experimental mouse
   population, we identified 13 ME loci affecting body weight, most of
   which (12/13) exhibited prenatal effects, and nearly half (6/13)
   exhibiting postnatal effects. MGEs contributed more to variation in body
   weight than the direct effects of the offsprings' own genotypes until
   mice reached adulthood, but continued to represent a major component of
   variation through adulthood. Prenatal effects always contributed more
   variation than postnatal effects, especially for those effects that
   persisted into adulthood. These results suggest that MGEs may be an
   important component of genetic architecture that is generally overlooked
   in studies focused on direct mapping from genotype to phenotype. Our
   approach can be used in both experimental and natural populations,
   providing a widely practicable means of expanding our understanding of
   MGEs.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of recent interest in sexual selection in females, debate
   exists over whether traits that influence female-female competition are
   sexually selected. This review uses female-female aggressive behavior as
   a model behavioral trait for understanding the evolutionary mechanisms
   promoting intrasexual competition, focusing especially on sexual
   selection. I employ a broad definition of sexual selection, whereby
   traits that influence competition for mates are sexually selected,
   whereas those that directly influence fecundity or offspring survival
   are naturally selected. Drawing examples from across animal taxa,
   including humans, I examine 4 predictions about female intrasexual
   competition based on the abundance of resources, the availability of
   males, and the direct or indirect benefits those males provide. These
   patterns reveal a key sex difference in sexual selection: Although
   females may compete for the number of mates, they appear to compete more
   so for access to high-quality mates that provide direct and indirect
   (genetic) benefits. As is the case in males, intrasexual selection in
   females also includes competition for essential resources required for
   access to mates. If mate quality affects the magnitude of mating
   success, then restricting sexual selection to competition for quantity
   of mates may ignore important components of fitness in females and
   underestimate the role of sexual selection in shaping female phenotype.
   In the future, understanding sex differences in sexual selection will
   require further exploration of the extent of mutual intrasexual
   competition and the incorporation of quality of mating success into the
   study of sexual selection in both sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Relatively few investigations explicitly test for concordant versus
   conflicting selection pressures from intrasexual versus intersexual
   selection. Here, we examine the effects of male body mass and behavioral
   type (BT) on reproductive success in the spider Anelosimus studiosus,
   with emphasis placed on the potential interaction between intrasexual
   and intersexual selection influences. Female A. studiosus exhibit either
   an aggressive-active or docile-passive BT, both of which co-occur in
   multifemale colonies. Males, in contrast, exhibit a more continuous
   distribution of behavioral tendencies. We investigated the male traits
   favored by females in five trial types: one docile female, one
   aggressive female, four docile females, four aggressive females, and two
   docile and two aggressive females. Male reproductive success was
   estimated by the number eggs produced by females following staged mating
   trials. In previous work, it was established that large aggressive males
   are favored in male male contests, an intrasexual effect. However, large
   aggressive males were not universally favored here. We failed to detect
   an effect of male body mass or aggressiveness on reproductive success in
   trials with all docile females; however, in situations involving
   aggressive females, large aggressive males experienced diminished
   reproductive success relative to small docile males. Large, aggressive
   males were also more likely to be attacked and killed by aggressive
   females in the first 20 min of staged encounters and were more likely to
   be found dead after 72 h of unobserved interactions. Taken together, our
   data suggest that the reproductive consequences of male traits differ
   based on (1) the aspect of sexual selection being considered
   (intrasexual versus intersexual) and (2) the BT of their prospective
   mates: large aggressive males enjoy advantages in intrasexual selection
   and when courting docile females and small docile males experience
   reduced risk of cannibalism and increased reproductive success with
   aggressive females.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of sexually monomorphic (i.e. mutual) ornamentation has
   attracted growing attention as a `blind-spot' in evolutionary biology.
   The popular consensus is that female ornaments are subject to the same
   modes of sexual selection as males: intrasexual competition and mate
   choice. However, it remains unclear how these forces interact within and
   between sexes, or whether they fully capture selection on female traits.
   One possibility is that the `armament-ornament' model - which proposes
   that traits used primarily in male-male contests are also co-opted by
   females as indicators of male quality can be extended to explain signal
   evolution in both sexes. We examine this idea by testing the function of
   acoustic signals in two species of duetting antbirds. Behavioural
   observations and playback experiments suggest that male and female songs
   function primarily as armaments in competitive interactions. Removal
   experiments reveal that song is also a classic ornament used by unpaired
   males and females to advertise for mates. These results indicate that
   `armament-ornament' processes may operate in reciprocal format,
   potentially explaining widespread mutual ornamentation in species with
   elevated intrasexual competition for resources. In addition, given that
   songs mediate competition between species outside the breeding season,
   our findings suggest that processes shaping monomorphic ornaments extend
   beyond the traditional definitions of sexual selection and are best
   understood in the broader framework of social selection.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive effort, egg number and egg size are traditionally
   considered to be `female' life history traits. However, females often
   adjust the amount of resources allocated to reproduction depending on
   their mate, causing male environmental effects on life history traits.
   If females respond to male traits which are genetically variable, then
   male environmental effects contain indirect genetic effects. Estimates
   of how much of the total variation in life history traits originates
   from female effects versus male environmental effects, seems mostly
   lacking. We have investigated variation in rates of egg production and
   in egg size in the annual Argentinian blackfin pearl killifish
   Austrolebias nigripinnis, in a crossed design where males were exchanged
   repeatedly between females. Our analysis of phenotypic variance
   components of reproductive effort, egg size and egg number indicates
   that the amount of variation contributed by male environmental effects
   is equal (egg size, reproductive effort) or larger (egg number) than
   that between females. For egg size and number, we find that male
   environmental effects consist of a male random effect representing the
   average response of females to male phenotype, plus a female-male
   interaction term. This term can be understood as the deviation from the
   population mean of an individual female's response. For reproductive
   effort, we find that the male environmental effect consists of an
   interaction term only. Random effects on egg size and number
   additionally vary in magnitude depending on the weekday where we
   collected eggs, probably due to cyclic variation in experimental
   conditions. Since we find that both male phenotype and environmental
   conditions affect egg size and number as determined by females, our
   results suggest that selection on these life history traits will be
   frequency-dependent.}},

Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{Selection has led to the evolution of a variety of different mating
   strategies, each adapted to different competitive challenges. But what
   happens if the competitive challenges depend on the social environment?
   Here we discuss and review examples of socially cued anticipatory
   plasticity: irreversible developmental tactics in which resource
   allocation during the juvenile stage is altered to develop an
   appropriate phenotype for the competitive or mate choice environment
   that an individual encounters when mature. There are numerous
   theoretical and empirical examinations of the role of the social
   environment on the strength and direction of selection. However only a
   handful of empirical studies examine how the social environment affects
   juvenile allocation and whether such tactics are adaptive. The goal of
   this review is to synthesize current knowledge about socially cued
   anticipatory plasticity, including the sensory modalities that
   individuals use to predict the adult competitive and mating environment.
   We then outline the various factors that are necessary for the evolution
   of socially cued anticipatory plasticity and discuss how this can affect
   phenotypic evolution.. We conclude by suggesting some directions that
   future studies should take in order to understand how social variation
   can alter selection and the evolution of development.}},

Abstract = {{Gene-environment correlation (rGE) occurs when an individual's genotype
   determines its choice of environment, generating a correlation between
   environment and genotype frequency. In particular, social rGE, caused by
   genetic variation in social environment choice, can critically determine
   both individual development and the course of social selection. Despite
   its foundational role in social evolution and developmental psychology
   theory, natural genetic variation in social environment choice has
   scarcely been examined empirically. Drosophila melanogaster provides an
   ideal system for investigating social rGE. Flies live socially in nature
   and have many opportunities to make social decisions; and natural,
   heterozygous genotypes may be replicated, enabling comparisons between
   genotypes across environments. Using this approach, I show that all
   aspects of social environment choice vary among natural genotypes,
   demonstrating pervasive social rGE. Surprisingly, genetic variation in
   group-size preference was density dependent, indicating that the
   behavioral and evolutionary consequences of rGE may depend on the
   context in which social decisions are made. These results provide the
   first detailed investigation of social rGE, and illustrate that that
   genetic variation may influence organismal performance by specifying the
   environment in which traits are expressed.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive senescence, an intra-individual decline in reproductive
   function with age, is widespread, but proximate factors determining its
   rate remain largely unknown. Most studies of reproductive senescence
   focus on females, leaving senescence in male function and its
   implications for female function largely understudied. We constructed
   linear mixed models to explore the interactive effects of paternal and
   maternal age and a life-history trait (i.e. age at first reproduction)
   on four fitness components (i.e. laying date, clutch size, number of
   fledglings and number of recruits) measured in a wild, breeding
   population of blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus ogliastrae where individual
   breeding success has been followed for over 30 years (our dataset
   spanned 29 years). Previous studies have shown that, across female
   lifespan, laying date decreases and subsequently increases; earlier
   laying dates result in higher fitness because hatchlings have greater
   access to a seasonal food source. Our analyses reveal that females that
   initiate reproduction early in life show a greater delay in laying date
   with old age. In addition to delayed laying dates, older females lay
   smaller clutches. However, the magnitude of female age effects was
   influenced by the age at first reproduction of their breeding partners.
   Senescence of laying date and clutch size was reduced when females mated
   with males that reproduced early in life compared to males that delayed
   reproduction. We confirmed that both laying date and clutch size were
   significantly correlated with reproductive fitness suggesting that these
   dynamics early in the breeding cycle can have long-term consequences.
   These complex phenotypic interactions shed light on the proximate
   mechanisms underlying reproductive senescence in nature and highlight
   the potential importance of cross-sex age by life-history interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the work in evolutionary game theory starts with a model of a
   social situation that gives rise to a particular payoff matrix and
   analyses how behaviour evolves through natural selection. Here, we
   invert this approach and ask, given a model of how individuals behave,
   how the payoff matrix will evolve through natural selection. In
   particular, we ask whether a prisoner's dilemma game is stable against
   invasions by mutant genotypes that alter the payoffs. To answer this
   question, we develop a two-tiered framework with goal-oriented dynamics
   at the behavioural time scale and a diploid population genetic model at
   the evolutionary time scale. Our results are two-fold: first, we show
   that the prisoner's dilemma is subject to invasions by mutants that
   provide incentives for cooperation to their partners, and that the
   resulting game is a coordination game similar to the hawk-dove game.
   Second, we find that for a large class of mutants and symmetric games, a
   stable genetic polymorphism will exist in the locus determining the
   payoff matrix, resulting in a complex pattern of behavioural diversity
   in the population. Our results highlight the importance of considering
   the evolution of payoff matrices to understand the evolution of animal
   social systems.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal variation in selection can be generated by temporal variation
   in either the fitness surface or phenotypic distributions around a
   static fitness surface, or both concurrently. Here, we use within-and
   between-generation sampling of fitness surfaces and phenotypic
   distributions over 2 years to investigate the causes of temporal
   variation in the form of sexual selection on body size in the damselfly
   Enallagma aspersum. Within a year, when the average female body size
   differed substantially from the average male body size, male body size
   experienced directional selection. In contrast, when male and female
   size distributions overlapped, male body size experienced stabilizing
   selection when variances in body size were large, but no appreciable
   selection when the variances in body size were small. The causes of
   temporal variation in the form of selection can only be inferred by
   accounting for changes in both the fitness surface and changes in the
   distribution of phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Inclusive fitness theory has a combination of simplicity, generality,
   and accuracy that has made it an extremely successful way of thinking
   about and modeling effects on kin. However, there are types of social
   interactions that, although covered, are not illuminated. Here, I expand
   the inclusive fitness approach and the corresponding neighbor-modulated
   approach to specify two other kinds of social selection. Kind selection,
   which includes green-beards and many nonadditive games, is where
   selection depends on an actor's trait having different effects on others
   depending on whether they share the trait. Kith selection includes
   social effects that do not require either kin or kind, such as mutualism
   and manipulation. It involves social effects of a trait that affect a
   partner, with feedback to the actor's fitness. I derive expanded
   versions of Hamilton's rule for kith and kind selection, generalizing
   Hamilton's insight that we can model social selection through a sum of
   fitness effects, each multiplied by an appropriate association
   coefficient. Kinship is, thus, only one of the important types of
   association, but all can be incorporated within an expanded inclusive
   fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence indicates that grassland community structure and species
   diversity are influenced by genetic variation within species. We review
   what is known regarding the impact of intraspecific diversity on
   grassland community structure, using an ancient limestone pasture as a
   focal example. Two genotype-dependent effects appear to modify community
   structure in this system. First, the abundance of individual constituent
   species can depend upon the combined influence of direct genetic effects
   stemming from individuals within the population. Second, the outcome of
   localized interspecific interactions occurring within the community can
   depend on the genotypes of participating individuals (indicating
   indirect genetic effects). Only genotypic interactions are thought to be
   capable of allowing the long-term coexistence of both genotypes and
   species. We discuss the implications of these effects for the
   maintenance of diversity in grasslands. Next, we present new
   observations indicating that losses of genotypic diversity from each of
   two species can be predicted by the abundance of other coexisting
   species within experimental grassland communities. These results suggest
   genotype-specific responses to abundance in other coexisting species. We
   conclude that both direct and indirect genetic effects are likely to
   shape community structure and species coexistence in grasslands,
   implying tight linkage between fine-scale genetic and community
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Studying the genetic basis of traits involved in ecological interactions
   is a fundamental part of elucidating the connections between
   evolutionary and ecological processes. Such knowledge allows one to link
   genetic models of trait evolution with ecological models describing
   interactions within and between species. Previous work has shown that
   connections between genetic and ecological processes in Arabidopsis
   thaliana may be mediated by the fact that quantitative trait loci (QTL)
   with `direct' effects on traits of individuals also have pleiotropic
   `indirect' effects on traits expressed in neighbouring plants. Here, we
   further explore these connections by examining functional relationships
   between traits affected directly and indirectly by the same QTL. We
   develop a novel approach using structural equation models (SEMs) to
   determine whether observed pleiotropic effects result from traits
   directly affected by the QTL in focal individuals causing the changes in
   the neighbours' phenotypes. This hypothesis was assessed using SEMs to
   test whether focal plant phenotypes appear to mediate the connection
   between the focal plants' genotypes and the phenotypes of their
   neighbours, or alternatively, whether the connection between the focal
   plants' genotypes and the neighbours' phenotypes is mediated by
   unmeasured traits. We implement this analysis using a QTL of major
   effect that maps to the well-characterized flowering locus, FRIGIDA. The
   SEMs support the hypothesis that the pleiotropic indirect effects of
   this locus arise from size and developmental timing-related traits in
   focal plants affecting the expression of developmental traits in their
   neighbours. Our findings provide empirical insights into the genetics
   and nature of intraspecific ecological interactions. Our technique holds
   promise in directing future work into the genetic basis and functional
   relationship of traits mediating and responding to ecological
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Social niche construction (SNC) occurs when animals actively shape their
   social environments. Currently the fitness consequences of SNC are
   poorly understood, and no study has examined whether variation in SNC
   has a genetic basis. Here we report the first instance of genetic
   variation in SNC by showing that Drosophila male aggression shapes the
   social environment. We allowed flies of different genotypes to interact
   in complex arenas; we measured the number and sex of individuals in the
   groups that formed and counted instances of mating. Arenas containing
   more aggressive male genotypes formed groups with fewer males,
   demonstrating that aggressive male genotypes experienced different
   social environments than nonaggressive genotypes. Further, genotypes
   with highest mating success were those whose SNC behavior generated the
   social environment in which they were most adept at mating: genotypes
   who mate most often after winning aggressive encounters benefit from
   aggressive SNC, while genotypes who mate most often after losing achieve
   high mating rates by forgoing aggression. The presence of these
   alternative strategies-which were robust across eight population
   densities-revealed that selection on aggression and context-dependent
   mating was disruptive, consistent with the hypothesis that SNC can
   maintain genetic variation in multiple behaviors.}},

   Aggression}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{Theoretical and empirical studies have sought to explain the formation
   and maintenance of social relationships within groups. The resulting
   dominance hierarchies have significant fitness and survival consequences
   dependent upon social status. We hypothesised that each position or rank
   within a group has a distinctive brain gene expression profile that
   correlates with behavioural phenotype. Furthermore, transitions in rank
   position should determine which genes shift in expression concurrent
   with the new dominance status. We used a custom cDNA microarray to
   profile brain transcript expression in a model species, the rainbow
   trout, which forms tractable linear hierarchies. Dominant, subdominant
   and submissive individuals had distinctive transcript profiles with 110
   gene probes identified using conservative statistical analyses. By
   removing the dominant, we characterised the changes in transcript
   expression in sub-dominant individuals that became dominant
   demonstrating that the molecular transition occurred within 48 hours. A
   strong, novel candidate gene, ependymin, which was highly expressed in
   both the transcript and protein in subdominants relative to dominants,
   was tested further. Using antibody injection to inactivate ependymin in
   pairs of dominant and subdominant zebrafish, the subdominant fish
   exhibited a substantial increase in aggression in parallel with an
   enhanced competitive ability. This is the first study to characterise
   the molecular signatures of dominance status within groups and the first
   to implicate ependymin in control of aggressive behaviour. It also
   provides evidence for indirect genetic effect models in which
   genotype/phenotype of an individual is influenced by conspecific
   interactions within a group. The variation in the molecular profile of
   each individual within a group may offer a new explanation of
   intraspecific variation in gene expression within undefined groups of
   animals and provides new candidates for empirical study.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. There is relatively little information on how evolutionary
   processes that alter genetic variation in a focal species may affect
   interactions with other species, impact the structure or function of the
   community and ecosystem, and affect evolutionary feedbacks among
   interacting species through time.
   2. Because evolution can occur at ecological time-scales, it is
   important to understand how major selective events, such as climatic
   changes, can impact the community of interacting species and ecosystem
   processes by changing intraspecific genetic variation.
   3. The evidence linking genetic variation and evolution to community
   change and feedbacks has arisen from several different approaches whose
   results have not been synthesized into one conceptual framework, and
   whose commonalities may not be fully understood.
   4. This review synthesizes several different experimental approaches on
   how evolution may impact communities and ecosystems and focuses on five
   main issues: (i) the genetic basis to communities and ecosystems; (ii)
   the community and ecosystem consequences of among-population genetic
   differentiation; (iii) the role of local adaptation and co-evolution;
   (iv) the effects of trans-generational feedbacks and the eco-evo dynamic
   and; (v) the integration of community and ecosystem genetics and
   multi-level selection.
   5. Evolution can alter intraspecific genetic variation to affect
   indirect genetic effects and feedbacks. Future studies should
   investigate how communities and ecosystems are affected when evolution
   causes the strength of feedbacks to change.}},

Abstract = {{By determining access to limited resources, social dominance is often an
   important determinant of fitness. Thus, if heritable, standard theory
   predicts mean dominance should evolve. However, dominance is usually
   inferred from the tendency to win contests, and given one winner and one
   loser in any dyadic contest, the mean proportion won will always equal
   0.5. Here, we argue that the apparent conflict between quantitative
   genetic theory and common sense is resolved by recognition of indirect
   genetic effects (IGEs). We estimate selection on, and genetic
   (co)variance structures for, social dominance, in a wild population of
   red deer Cervus elaphus, on the Scottish island of Rum. While dominance
   is heritable and positively correlated with lifetime fitness, contest
   outcomes depend as much on the genes carried by an opponent as on the
   genotype of a focal individual. We show how this dependency imposes an
   absolute evolutionary constraint on the phenotypic mean, thus
   reconciling theoretical predictions with common sense. More generally,
   we argue that IGEs likely provide a widespread but poorly recognized
   source of evolutionary constraint for traits influenced by competition.}},

Title = {{FERTILIZATION SUCCESS AND THE ESTIMATION OF GENETIC VARIANCE IN SPERM
   COMPETITIVENESS}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{746-756}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A key question in sexual selection is whether the ability of males to
   fertilize eggs under sperm competition exhibits heritable genetic
   variation. Addressing this question poses a significant problem,
   however, because a male's ability to win fertilizations ultimately
   depends on the competitive ability of rival males. Attempts to partition
   genetic variance in sperm competitiveness, as estimated from measures of
   fertilization success, must therefore account for stochastic effects due
   to the random sampling of rival sperm competitors. In this contribution,
   we suggest a practical solution to this problem. We advocate the use of
   simple cross-classified breeding designs for partitioning sources of
   genetic variance in sperm competitiveness and fertilization success and
   show how these designs can be used to avoid stochastic effects due to
   the random sampling of rival sperm competitors. We illustrate the
   utility of these approaches by simulating various scenarios for
   estimating genetic parameters in sperm competiveness, and show that the
   probability of detecting additive genetic variance in this trait is
   restored when stochastic effects due to the random sampling of rival
   sperm competitors are controlled. Our findings have important
   implications for the study of the evolutionary maintenance of polyandry.}},

Title = {{Repeatability of decision-making behaviour in male threespine
   stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus: Effects of dummy vs. live stimuli}},
Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{101-108}},
Abstract = {{Individuals select from a number of behaviours when responding to
   various situations and the decisions they make may affect their fitness.
   The costs and benefits of these responses vary among individuals causing
   them to differ even in identical situations. One example of this type of
   situation is when territorial males encounter both a male and female
   simultaneously, generating a trade-off that likely leads to individual
   differences due to differing costs of various actions among males. This
   situation commonly occurs in threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus
   aculeatus. However, for selection to act effectively, individuals must
   behave in a consistent manner and measuring repeatability can aid in
   understanding how selection may shape such trade-offs. Males of this
   species exhibit consistent individual differences in their response to
   dummy males and females but it is unknown if patterns are similar when
   feedback from the stimuli is present. To assess this, male threespine
   stickleback were tested with dummy and live male and female
   conspecifics, presented separately and simultaneously. While the same
   trends were found regardless of stimulus type, males were more
   aggressive towards the live conspecifics than to the dummies.
   Repeatability values were similar within a treatment regardless of
   whether live or dummy conspecifics were used, suggesting that
   individuals show the same level of consistency. This study adds to our
   understanding of consistent individual differences by demonstrating that
   feedback may not affect responses to conflicting stimuli and that male
   threespine stickleback respond in a consistent manner to both dummy and
   live stimuli {[}Current Zoology 57 (1): 101-108, 2011].}},

   the cellular slime moulds}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{329-342}},
Abstract = {{In social selection the phenotype of an individual depends on its own
   genotype as well as on the phenotypes, and so genotypes, of other
   individuals. This makes it impossible to associate an invariant
   phenotype with a genotype: the social context is crucial. Descriptions
   of metazoan development, which often is viewed as the acme of
   cooperative social behaviour, ignore or downplay this fact. The implicit
   justification for doing so is based on a group-selectionist point of
   view. Namely, embryos are clones, therefore all cells have the same
   evolutionary interest, and the visible differences between cells result
   from a common strategy. The reasoning is flawed, because phenotypic
   heterogeneity within groups can result from contingent choices made by
   cells from a flexible repertoire as in multicellular development. What
   makes that possible is phenotypic plasticity, namely the ability of a
   genotype to exhibit different phenotypes. However, co-operative social
   behaviour with division of labour requires that different phenotypes
   interact appropriately, not that they belong to the same genotype, or
   have overlapping genetic interests. We sketch a possible route to the
   evolution of social groups that involves many steps: (a) individuals
   that happen to be in spatial proximity benefit simply by virtue of their
   number; (b) traits that are already present act as preadaptations and
   improve the efficiency of the group; and (c) new adaptations evolve
   under selection in the social context-that is, via interactions between
   individuals-and further strengthen group behaviour. The Dictyostelid or
   cellular slime mould amoebae (CSMs) become multicellular in an unusual
   way, by the aggregation of free-living cells. In nature the resulting
   group can be genetically homogeneous (clonal) or heterogeneous
   (polyclonal); in either case its development, which displays strong
   cooperation between cells (to the extent of so-called altruism) is not
   affected. This makes the CSMs exemplars for the study of social
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Current interest in behavioural syndromes, or `animal personalities',
   reinforces a need for behavioural ecologists to adopt a multivariate
   view of phenotypes. Fortunately, many of the methodological and
   theoretical issues currently being dealt with by behavioural ecologists
   within the context of behavioural syndromes have previously been
   investigated by researchers in other areas of evolutionary ecology. As a
   result of these previous efforts, behavioural syndrome researchers have
   considerable theory and a wide range of tools already available to them.
   Here, we discuss aspects of quantitative genetics useful for
   understanding the multivariate phenotype as well as the relevance of
   quantitative genetics to behavioural syndrome research. These methods
   not only allow the proper characterization of the multivariate
   behavioural phenotype and genotype-including behaviours within, among
   and independent of behavioural syndrome structures-but also allow
   predictions as to how populations may respond to selection on behaviours
   within syndromes. An application of a quantitative genetics framework to
   behavioural syndrome research also clarifies and refines the questions
   that should be asked.}},

   versus Group Organization in Dynamic Social Network Models}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Social networks can be used to represent group structure as a network of
   interacting components, and also to quantify both the position of each
   individual and the global properties of a group. In a series of
   simulation experiments based on dynamic social networks, we test the
   prediction that social behaviors that help individuals reach prominence
   within their social group may conflict with their potential to benefit
   from their social environment. In addition to cases where individuals
   were able to benefit from improving both their personal relative
   importance and group organization, using only simple rules of social
   affiliation we were able to obtain results in which individuals would
   face a trade-off between these factors. While selection would favor (or
   work against) social behaviors that concordantly increase (or decrease,
   respectively) fitness at both individual and group level, when these
   factors conflict with each other the eventual selective pressure would
   depend on the relative returns individuals get from their social
   environment and their position within it. The presented results
   highlight the importance of a systems approach to studying animal
   sociality, in which the effects of social behaviors should be viewed not
   only through the benefits that those provide to individuals, but also in
   terms of how they affect broader social environment and how in turn this
   is reflected back on an individual's fitness.}},

Abstract = {{The evolutionary forces that drive fitness variation in species are of
   considerable interest. Despite this, the relative importance and
   interactions of genetic and social factors involved in the evolution of
   fitness traits in wild mammalian populations are largely unknown. To
   date, a few studies have demonstrated that fitness might be influenced
   by either social factors or genes in natural populations, but none have
   explored how the combined effect of social and genetic parameters might
   interact to influence fitness. Drawing from a long-term study of wild
   bottlenose dolphins in the eastern gulf of Shark Bay, Western Australia,
   we present a unique approach to understanding these interactions. Our
   study shows that female calving success depends on both genetic
   inheritance and social bonds. Moreover, we demonstrate that interactions
   between social and genetic factors also influence female fitness.
   Therefore, our study represents a major methodological advance, and
   provides critical insights into the interplay of genetic and social
   parameters of fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are abundant both in natural and
   domestic populations. Such social interactions cause phenotypes of
   individuals to depend on genes carried by other individuals, a
   phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects (IGE). Because IGEs have
   drastic effects on the rate and direction of response to selection,
   knowledge of their magnitude and relationship to direct genetic effects
   (DGE) is indispensable for understanding response to selection. Very
   little is known, however, of statistical power and optimum experimental
   designs for estimating IGEs. This work, therefore, presents expressions
   for the standard errors of the estimated (co)variances of DGEs and IGEs
   and identifies optimum experimental designs for their estimation. It
   also provides an expression for optimum family size and a numerical
   investigation of optimum group size. Designs with groups composed of two
   families were optimal and substantially better than designs with groups
   composed at random with respect to family. Results suggest that IGEs can
   be detected with similar to 1000-2000 individuals and/or similar to
   250-500 groups when using optimum designs. Those values appear feasible
   for agriculture and aquaculture and for the smaller laboratory species.
   In summary, this work provides the tools to optimize and quantify the
   required size of experiments aiming to identify IGEs. An R-package SE.
   IGE is available, which predicts SEs and identifies optimum family and
   group sizes.}},

Abstract = {{The tendency to fight is a well-known behavior in Valdostana cattle, and
   noncruel traditional contests are organized yearly by farmers to
   identify the most dominant cow. Cow battles consist of elimination
   matches that have important economic implications for both tourism and
   farmers. The aims of this study are 1) to validate a scoring system to
   express fighting ability, and 2) to carry out a genetic analysis for
   this trait using different data sets and models. A data set accounting
   for 16,509 fighting records of 5,981 cows relevant to contests over 6 yr
   was retained after editing (data set 1). Data on placements were used to
   compute a placement score accounting for wins, tournament size, and
   difficulty, and differentiating the 20 preliminary battles each year
   from the final match. A second data set was created using only the
   individual best yearly placement scores, that is, deleting repeats with
   a smaller placement score for the same animal within each year (data set
   2; n = 10,367 records, corresponding to a single datum per year per
   cow). Compared with the placement or position of each cow, the placement
   score proved to be less skewed (-1.45 for placement position and 1.25
   for placement score, respectively) and exhibited better coefficients for
   the probability of a normal distribution. An animal model REML method
   analysis (accounting for 13,456 animals in the pedigree) was carried
   out, with consideration given to different combinations of fixed and
   random nongenetic factors other than the random animal and permanent
   environmental effects. Results indicated that random factors other than
   additive genetic and permanent environment effects did not improve the
   model fit; therefore, it was not useful to take them into account.
   Heritability estimates obtained with the model showing the best fit were
   0.078 (data set 1) and 0.098 (data set 2). Results of this study
   indicate that selection for fighting ability in Valdostana cattle using
   data on battle performance is possible.}},

Abstract = {{Behaviour is typically regarded as among the most flexible of animal
   phenotypic traits. In particular, expression of cooperative behaviour is
   often assumed to be conditional upon the behaviours of others. This
   flexibility is a key component of many hypothesized mechanisms favouring
   the evolution of cooperative behaviour. However, evidence shows that
   cooperative behaviours are often less flexible than expected and that,
   in many species, individuals show consistent differences in the amount
   and type of cooperative and non-cooperative behaviours displayed. This
   phenomenon is known as `animal personality' or a `behavioural syndrome'.
   Animal personality is evolutionarily relevant, as it typically shows
   heritable variation and can entail fitness consequences, and hence, is
   subject to evolutionary change. Here, we review the empirical evidence
   for individual variation in cooperative behaviour across taxa, we
   examine the evolutionary processes that have been invoked to explain the
   existence of individual variation in cooperative behaviour and we
   discuss the consequences of consistent individual differences on the
   evolutionary stability of cooperation. We highlight that consistent
   individual variation in cooperativeness can both stabilize or disrupt
   cooperation in populations. We conclude that recognizing the existence
   of consistent individual differences in cooperativeness is essential for
   an understanding of the evolution and prevalence of cooperation.}},

Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Consistent inter-individual variation in behaviour over time and across
   contexts has been reported for a wide variety of animals, a phenomenon
   commonly referred to as personality. As behavioural patterns develop
   inside families, rearing conditions could have lasting effects on the
   expression of adult personality. In species with parental care,
   conflicts among family members impose selection on parental and
   offspring behaviour through coadaptation. Here, we argue that the
   interplay between the evolution of personality traits (i.e. boldness,
   exploration, activity, aggressiveness and sociability) expressed outside
   the family context and the specialized behaviours expressed inside
   families (i.e. offspring begging behaviour and parental response to
   offspring solicitations) can have important evolutionary consequences.
   Personality differences between parents may relate to the typically
   observed variation in the way they respond to offspring demand, and
   dependent offspring may already express personality differences, which
   may relate to the way they communicate with their parents and siblings.
   However, there has been little research on how personality relates to
   parental and offspring behaviours. Future research should thus focus on
   how and why personality may be related to the specialized parent and
   offspring behaviour that evolved as adaptations to family life.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions among conspecifics influence social evolution through two
   distinct but intimately related paths. First, they provide the
   opportunity for indirect genetic effects (IGEs), where genes expressed
   in one individual influence the expression of traits in others. Second,
   interactions can generate social selection when traits expressed in one
   individual influence the fitness of others. Here, we present a
   quantitative genetic model of multivariate trait evolution that
   integrates the effects of both IGEs and social selection, which have
   previously been modeled independently. We show that social selection
   affects evolutionary change whenever the breeding value of one
   individual covaries with the phenotype of its social partners. This
   covariance can be created by both relatedness and IGEs, which are shown
   to have parallel roles in determining evolutionary response. We show
   that social selection is central to the estimation of inclusive fitness
   and derive a version of Hamilton's rule showing the symmetrical effects
   of relatedness and IGEs on the evolution of altruism. We illustrate the
   utility of our approach using altruism, greenbeards, aggression, and
   weapons as examples. Our model provides a general predictive equation
   for the evolution of social phenotypes that encompasses specific cases
   such as kin selection and reciprocity. The parameters can be measured
   empirically, and we emphasize the importance of considering both IGEs
   and social selection, in addition to relatedness, when testing
   hypotheses about social evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions, especially those involving competition among
   individuals, are important in domesticated livestock and in natural
   populations. The heritability of traits affected by such interactions
   has two components, one originating in the individual like that of
   classical traits (direct effects) and the other originating in other
   group members (indirect effects). The latter type of trait represents a
   significant source of `hidden heritability' and it requires population
   structure and knowledge from relatives in order to access it for
   selective breeding. When ignored, competitive interactions may increase
   as an indirect response to direct selection, resulting in diminished
   yields. We illustrate how population genetic structure affects the
   response to selection of traits with indirect genetic effects using
   population genetic and quantitative genetic theory. Population genetic
   theory permits us to connect our results to the existing body of theory

Abstract = {{When individuals interact, phenotypic variation can be partitioned into
   direct genetic effects (DGEs) of the individuals' own genotypes,
   indirect genetic effects (IGEs) of their social partners' genotypes and
   epistatic interactions between the genotypes of interacting individuals
   ('genotype-by-genotype (GxG) epistasis'). These components can all play
   important roles in evolutionary processes, but few empirical studies
   have examined their importance. The social amoeba Dictyostelium
   discoideum provides an ideal system to measure these effects during
   social interactions and development. When starved, free-living amoebae
   aggregate and differentiate into a multicellular fruiting body with a
   dead stalk that holds aloft viable spores. By measuring interactions
   among a set of natural strains, we quantify DGEs, IGEs and GxG epistasis
   affecting spore formation. We find that DGEs explain most of the
   phenotypic variance (57.6\%) whereas IGEs explain a smaller (13.3\%) but
   highly significant component. Interestingly, GxG epistasis explains
   nearly a quarter of the variance (23.0\%), highlighting the complex
   nature of genotype interactions. These results demonstrate the large
   impact that social interactions can have on development and suggest that
   social effects should play an important role in developmental evolution
   in this system.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of experimental sexual selection have tested the effect of
   variation in the intensity of sexual selection on male investment in
   reproduction, particularly sperm. However, in several species, including
   Drosophila pseudoobscura, no sperm response to experimental evolution
   has occurred. Here, we take a quantitative genetics approach to examine
   whether genetic constraints explain the limited evolutionary response.
   We quantified direct and indirect genetic variation, and genetic
   correlations within and between the sexes, in experimental populations
   of D. pseudoobscura. We found that sperm number may be limited by low
   heritability and evolvability whereas sperm quality (length) has
   moderate V(A) and CV(A) but does not evolve. Likewise, the female
   reproductive tract, suggested to drive the evolution of sperm, did not
   respond to experimental sexual selection even though there was
   sufficient genetic variation. The lack of genetic correlations between
   the sexes supports the opportunity for sexual conflict over investment
   in sperm by males and their storage by females. Our results suggest no
   absolute constraint arising from a lack of direct or indirect genetic
   variation or patterns of genetic covariation. These patterns show why
   responses to experimental evolution are hard to predict, and why
   research on genetic variation underlying interacting reproductive traits
   is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetics effects (IGEs)-when the genotype of one individual
   affects the phenotypic expression of a trait in another-may alter
   evolutionary trajectories beyond that predicted by standard quantitative
   genetic theory as a consequence of genotypic evolution of the social
   environment. For IGEs to occur, the trait of interest must respond to
   one or more indicator traits in interacting conspecifics. In
   quantitative genetic models of IGEs, these responses (reaction norms)
   are termed interaction effect coefficients and are represented by the
   parameter psi (Psi). The extent to which Psi exhibits genetic variation
   within a population, and may therefore itself evolve, is unknown. Using
   an experimental evolution approach, we provide evidence for a genetic
   basis to the phenotypic response caused by IGEs on sexual display traits
   in Drosophila serrata. We show that evolution of the response is
   affected by sexual but not natural selection when flies adapt to a novel
   environment. Our results indicate a further mechanism by which IGEs can
   alter evolutionary trajectories-the evolution of interaction effects
   themselves.}},

Abstract = {{Developmental plasticity allows juvenile animals to assess environmental
   cues and adaptively shape behavioral and morphological traits to
   maximize fitness in their adult environment {[}1]. Sexual signals are
   particularly conspicuous cues, making them likely candidates for
   mediating such responses. Plasticity in male reproductive traits is a
   common phenomenon, but empirical evidence for signal-mediated plasticity
   in males is lacking. We tested whether experience of acoustic sexual
   signals during juvenile stages influences the development of three adult
   traits in the continuously breeding field cricket Teleogryllus
   oceanicus: male mating tactics, reproductive investment, and condition.
   All three traits were affected by juvenile acoustic experience. Males of
   this species produce a long-range calling song to attract receptive
   females, but they can also behave as satellites by parasitizing other
   males' calls {[}2]. Males reared in an environment mimicking a
   population with many calling males were less likely to exhibit satellite
   behavior, invested more in reproductive tissues, and attained higher
   condition than males reared in a silent environment. These results
   contrast with other studies {[}3] and demonstrate how the effects of
   juvenile social experience on adult male morphology, reproductive
   investment, and behavior may subsequently influence sexual selection and
   phenotypic evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions between individuals, such as co-operation and
   competition, are key factors in evolution by natural selection. As a
   consequence, evolutionary biologists have developed extensive theories
   to understand the consequences of social interactions for response to
   natural selection. Current genetic improvement programmes in animal
   husbandry, in contrast largely ignore the implications of social
   interactions for the design of breeding programmes. Recently, we have
   developed theoretical and empirical tools to quantify the magnitude of
   heritable social effects, ie the heritable effects that animals have on
   their group mates' traits, in livestock populations, and to utilise
   those effects in genetic improvement programmes. Results in commercial
   populations of pigs and laying hens indicate large heritable social
   effects, and the potential to substantially increase responses to
   selection in traits affected by social interactions. In pigs, including
   social effects into the breeding programme affected aggressive
   behaviour, both at mixing and in stable groups, indicating changes in
   the way dominance relationships are established and in aggressiveness.
   In laying hens, we applied selection between kin-groups to reduce
   mortality due to cannibalistic pecking. This resulted in a considerable
   difference in mortality between the low mortality line and the
   unselected control line in the first generation (20 vs 30\%).
   Furthermore, changes in behavioural and neurobiological responses to
   stress were detected in the low mortality line, pointing to reduced
   fearfulness and stress sensitivity. These first results indicate that
   including social effects into breeding programmes is a promising way to
   reduce negative social interactions in farm animals, and possibly to
   also increase positive social interactions, by breeding animals with
   better social skills.}},

Abstract = {{Female reproductive performance can be strongly affected by male care,
   so that breeding time, a trait expressed only by females, can be seen as
   one trait determined by both male and female genotypes. Animal model
   analyses of a 46-year study of red-billed gulls (Larus novaehollandiae
   scopulinus) revealed that laying date was not heritable in females (h2 =
   0.001 +/- 0.030), but significantly so in males (h2 = 0.134 +/- 0.029).
   Heritability of breeding time in males probably reflects genetic
   variability in some other trait such as courtship feeding ability. In
   line with predictions of evolutionary models incorporating indirect
   genetic effects, the strong and consistent directional selection for
   advanced breeding time has not resulted in detectable selection response
   in males. Our results demonstrate that a female trait is largely
   determined by genetic characteristics of its mate, and hence, any
   evolutionary change in red-billed gull breeding time depends critically
   on genetic variation in males.}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding of insect societies is rapidly expanding due to an
   emphasis on integrative approaches. Emerging tools enabling the
   molecular dissection of social behavior, together with novel hypotheses
   for the evolution of eusociality, are emblematic of this progress.
   However, an obstacle to a truly integrative approach remains, as social
   physiology-the basis of group-level coordination-has generally been
   neglected by geneticists. In this paper, we begin a synthesis of these
   fields by first reviewing three classes of social insect organization
   that mark major transitions in increasing social complexity. We then
   develop an expansion of the superorganism concept in order to place
   eusociality into a broad evolutionary context, and we also interpret
   current molecular and genetic work on the evolution of eusociality. The
   groundplan hypothesis proposes that eusociality arose via simple changes
   in the regulation of ancestral gene sets affecting reproductive
   physiology and behavior, and we argue that this hypothesis is
   explanatory for the evolution of division of labor (social anatomy) but
   not for the regulatory systems that ensure group-level coordination of
   action (social physiology), which we propose is dependent on previously
   unrelated traits that are brought together into novel genetic networks.
   We conclude with a review of recent work in sociogenomics that supports
   our hypotheses.}},

Title = {{Antagonistic Parent-Offspring Co-Adaptation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: In species across taxa, offspring have means to influence
   parental investment (PI). PI thus evolves as an interacting phenotype
   and indirect genetic effects may strongly affect the co-evolutionary
   dynamics of offspring and parental behaviors. Evolutionary theory
   focused on explaining how exaggerated offspring solicitation can be
   understood as resolution of parent-offspring conflict, but the
   evolutionary origin and diversification of different forms of family
   interactions remains unclear.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In contrast to previous theory that
   largely uses a static approach to predict how ``offspring individuals''
   and ``parental individuals'' should interact given conflict over PI, we
   present a dynamic theoretical framework of antagonistic selection on the
   PI individuals obtain/take as offspring and the PI they provide as
   parents to maximize individual lifetime reproductive success; we analyze
   a deterministic and a stochastic version of this dynamic framework. We
   show that a zone for equivalent co-adaptation outcomes exists in which
   stable levels of PI can evolve and be maintained despite fast strategy
   transitions and ongoing co-evolutionary dynamics. Under antagonistic
   co-adaptation, cost-free solicitation can evolve as an adaptation to
   emerging preferences in parents.
   Conclusions/Significance: We show that antagonistic selection across the
   offspring and parental life-stage of individuals favors co-adapted
   offspring and parental behavior within a zone of equivalent outcomes.
   This antagonistic parent-offspring co-adaptation does not require
   solicitation to be costly, allows for rapid divergence and evolutionary
   novelty and potentially explains the origin and diversification of the
   observed provisioning forms in family life.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Efforts to understand the links between evolutionary and ecological
   dynamics hinge on our ability to measure and understand how genes
   influence phenotypes, fitness and population dynamics. Quantitative
   genetics provides a range of theoretical and empirical tools with which
   to achieve this when the relatedness between individuals within a
   population is known.
   2. A number of recent studies have used a type of mixed-effects model,
   known as the animal model, to estimate the genetic component of
   phenotypic variation using data collected in the field. Here, we provide
   a practical guide for ecologists interested in exploring the potential
   to apply this quantitative genetic method in their research.
   3. We begin by outlining, in simple terms, key concepts in quantitative
   genetics and how an animal model estimates relevant quantitative genetic
   parameters, such as heritabilities or genetic correlations.
   4. We then provide three detailed example tutorials, for implementation
   in a variety of software packages, for some basic applications of the
   animal model. We discuss several important statistical issues relating
   to best practice when fitting different kinds of mixed models.
   5. We conclude by briefly summarizing more complex applications of the
   animal model, and by highlighting key pitfalls and dangers for the
   researcher wanting to begin using quantitative genetic tools to address
   ecological and evolutionary questions.}},

Abstract = {{Competition and cooperation is fundamental to evolution by natural

   conspecifics interact. Results show that interactions among conspecifics
   generate extra heritable variance in fitness, and that interacting with
   kin is the key to evolutionary success because it translates the extra
   heritable variance into response in fitness. This work also unifies
   Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection (FTNS) and Hamilton's
   inclusive fitness (IF). The FTNS implies that natural selection
   maximizes fitness, whereas Hamilton proposed maximization of IF. This
   work shows that the FTNS describes the increase in IF, rather than
   direct fitness, at a rate equal to the additive genetic variance in
   fitness. Thus, Hamilton's IF and Fisher's FTNS both describe the

Abstract = {{Increased female reproductive rates usually result in accelerated
   senescence. This correlation provides a link between the evolutionary
   conflict of the sexes and aging when ejaculate components elevate female
   reproductive rates at the cost of future reproduction. It is not clear
   whether this female cost is manifest as shorter lifespan or an earlier
   onset or a steeper rate of reproductive senescence. It also is unclear
   whether beneficial ejaculates release females from reproductive
   trade-offs and, if so, which senescence parameters are affected. We
   examined these issues in the bedbug, Cimex lectularius, a long-lived
   insect that shows reduced female lifespan as well as female reproductive
   senescence at the male-determined mating frequency. We demonstrate
   experimentally that, independently of the mating frequency, females
   receiving more ejaculate show increased reproductive rates and enter
   reproductive senescence later than females receiving less ejaculate. The
   rate of reproductive senescence did not differ between treatments, and
   reproductive rates did not predict mortality. The ejaculate effects were
   consistent in inter-and intra-population crosses, suggesting they have
   not evolved recently and are not caused by inbreeding. Our results
   suggest that ejaculate components compensate for the costs of elevated
   female reproductive rates in bedbugs by delaying the onset of
   reproductive senescence. Ejaculate components that are beneficial to
   polyandrous females could have arisen because male traits that protect
   the ejaculate have positive pleiotropic effects and/or because female
   counter-adaptations to antagonistic male traits exceed the
   neutralization of those traits. That males influence female reproductive
   senescence has important consequences for trade-offs between
   reproduction and longevity and for studies of somatic senescence.}},

Abstract = {{Social environments are inherently dynamic, often changing depending on
   the frequency and outcomes of conspecific interactions - they can be
   simultaneously the targets and agents of selection. Understanding how
   organisms settle in heterogeneous social environments and the effects
   this has on reproductive success is vital to our understanding of the
   selective forces at work in wild populations. From an intensive
   behavioural and ecological study of territoriality in the polymorphic
   white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), we demonstrate that
   males of the two morphs inhabit social niches that correspond to their
   respective alternative reproductive strategies. By integrating molecular
   ecology and Geographic Information Systems, we generated continuous,
   socio-spatial models of local conspecific density and cuckoldry risk.
   Our results suggest that the morphs segregate their territories based on
   socio-spatial variables, creating a heterogeneous social landscape that
   matches each behavioural phenotype with a favourable social environment.
   Specifically, the monogamous tan males tended to settle in low-density
   areas that were also low for cuckoldry risk, while the opposite was true
   for the promiscuous white males. This pattern of socio-spatial
   heterogeneity, combined with the social niche partitioning we observed,
   might act as a social niche polymorphism, and play an important role in
   maintenance of the alternative reproductive strategies of the
   white-throated sparrow. Socio-spatial factors, similar to those observed
   in the white-throated sparrow, may play important roles in the evolution
   of mating systems in other species, even those with more continuous or
   cryptic variation.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years much progress has been made towards understanding the
   selective forces involved in the evolution of social behaviour including
   conflicts over reproduction among group members. Here, I argue that an
   important additional step necessary for advancing our understanding of
   the resolution of potential conflicts within insect societies is to
   consider the genetics of the behaviours involved. First, I discuss how
   epigenetic modifications of behaviour may affect conflict resolution
   within groups. Second, I review known natural polymorphisms of social
   organization to demonstrate that a lack of consideration of the genetic
   mechanisms involved may lead to erroneous explanations of the adaptive
   significance of behaviour. Third, I suggest that, on the basis of recent
   genetic studies of sexual conflict in Drosophila, it is necessary to
   reconsider the possibility of within-group manipulation by means of
   chemical substances (i.e. pheromones). Fourth, I address the issue of
   direct versus indirect genetic effects, which is of particular
   importance for the study of behaviour in social groups. Fifth, I discuss
   the issue of how a genetic influence on dominance hierarchies and
   reproductive division of labour can have secondary effects, for example
   in the evolution of promiscuity. Finally, because the same sets of genes
   (e. g. those implicated in chemical signalling and the responses that
   are triggered) may be used even in species as divergent as ants,
   cooperative breeding birds and primates, an integration of genetic
   mechanisms into the field of social evolution may also provide unifying
   ideas.}},

Abstract = {{Hypotheses: Adaptation to different environments can drive the evolution
   of mating isolation and thereby contribute to ecological speciation.
   Adaptive divergence in nest characteristics, which could be one avenue
   to mating isolation, has received little attention. For it to be
   important, populations adapted to different environments should show
   genetic differences in nest characteristics.
   Organisms: Second-generation, laboratory-reared stocks of threespine
   stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) from the Misty system, British
   Columbia, Canada. Experimental fish included pure lake fish, pure inlet
   fish, and lake-inlet hybrids.
   Methods: Males of different types (lake, inlet, and hybrid) were paired
   in aquaria, allowed to build nests, and then exposed to females of all
   three types (individually and on separate days). The resulting nests
   were photographed, collected, weighed, and dissected.
   Results: Lake nests were bulkier than inlet nests, and less often placed
   on gravel substrate than sand. Hybrid males tended to build intermediate
   nests but showed very high variation. Some hybrids built lake-like nests
   and others built inlet-like nests.
   Conclusions: Nest characteristics show genetic differences between lake
   and inlet stickleback, and might therefore contribute to any mating
   isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Plasticity in female mate choice can fundamentally alter selection on
   male ornaments, but surprisingly few studies have examined the role of
   social learning in shaping female mating decisions in invertebrates. We
   used the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus to show that females
   retain information about the attractiveness of available males based on
   previous social experience, compare that information with incoming
   signals and then dramatically reverse their preferences to produce
   final, predictable, mating decisions. Male ornament evolution in the
   wild may depend much more on the social environment and behavioural
   flexibility through learning than was previously thought for non-social
   invertebrates. The predictive power of these results points to a
   pressing need for theoretical models of sexual selection that
   incorporate effects of social experience.}},

Abstract = {{The solicitation behaviours performed by dependent young are under
   selection from the environment created by their parents, as well as
   wider ecological conditions. Here we show how mechanisms acting before
   hatching enable canary offspring to adapt their begging behaviour to a
   variable post-hatching world. Cross-fostering experiments revealed that
   canary nestling begging intensity is positively correlated with the
   provisioning level of their own parents (to foster chicks). When we
   experimentally increased food quality before and during egg laying,
   mothers showed higher faecal androgen levels and so did their nestlings,
   even when they were cross-fostered before hatching to be reared by
   foster mothers that had been exposed to a standard regime of food
   quality. Higher parental androgen levels were correlated with greater
   levels of post-hatching parental provisioning and (we have previously
   shown) increased faecal androgens in chicks were associated with greater
   begging intensity. We conclude that androgens mediate environmentally
   induced plasticity in the expression of both parental and offspring
   traits, which remain correlated as a result of prenatal effects,
   probably acting within the egg. Offspring can thus adapt their begging
   intensity to variable family and ecological environments.}},

Abstract = {{The equilibrium sequence diversity of genes within a population and the
   rate of sequence divergence between populations or species depends on a
   variety of factors, including expression pattern, mutation rate, nature
   of selection, random drift, and mating system. Here, we extend
   population genetic theory developed for maternal-effect genes to predict
   the equilibrium polymorphism within species and sequence divergence
   among species for genes with social effects on fitness. We show how the
   fitness effects of genes, mating system, and genetic system affect
   predicted gene polymorphism. We find that, because genes with indirect
   social effects on fitness effectively experience weaker selection, they
   are expected to harbor higher levels of polymorphism relative to genes
   with direct fitness effects. The relative increase in polymorphism is
   proportional to the inverse of the genetic relatedness between
   individuals expressing the gene and their social partners that
   experience the fitness effects of the gene. We find a similar pattern of
   more rapid divergence between populations or species for genes with
   indirect social effects relative to genes with direct effects. We focus
   our discussion on the social insects, organisms with diverse indirect
   genetic effects, mating and genetic systems, and we suggest specific
   examples for testing our predictions with emerging sociogenomic tools.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which occur when phenotypic expression
   in one individual is influenced by genes in another conspecific
   individual, may have a drastic effect on evolutionary response to
   selection. General evolutionary models of IGEs have been developed using
   two distinct theoretical frameworks derived from maternal effects
   theory. The first framework is trait-based and focuses on how phenotypes
   are influenced by specific traits in a social partner, with the strength
   of interactions defined by the matrix Psi. The second framework
   partitions total genetic variance into components representing direct
   effects, indirect effects, and the covariance between them, without
   identifying specific social traits responsible for IGEs. The latter
   framework has been employed more commonly by empiricists because the
   methods for estimating variance components are relatively
   straightforward. Here, we show how these two theoretical frameworks are
   related to each other and derive equations that can be used to translate
   between them. This translation leads to a generalized method that can be
   used to estimate Psi via standard quantitative genetic breeding designs
   or pedigrees from natural populations. This method can be used in a very
   general set of circumstances and is widely applicable to all IGEs,
   including maternal effects and other interactions among relatives.}},

Abstract = {{How and why cooperation evolves, particularly among nonrelatives,
   remains a major paradox for evolutionary biologists and behavioral
   ecologists. Although much attention has focused on fitness consequences
   associated with cooperating, relatively little is known about the second
   component of evolutionary change, the inheritance of cooperation or
   reciprocity. The genetics of behaviors that can only be expressed in the
   context of interactions are particularly difficult to describe because
   the relevant genes reside in multiple social partners. Indirect genetic
   effects (IGEs) describe the influence of genes carried in social
   partners on the phenotype of a focal individual and thus provide a novel
   approach to quantifying the genetics underlying interactions such as
   reciprocal cooperation. We used inbred lines of guppies and a novel
   application of IGE theory to describe the dual genetic control of
   predator inspection and social behavior, both classic models of
   reciprocity. We identified effects of focal strain, social group strain,
   and interactions between focal and group strains on variation in focal
   behavior. We measured., the coefficient of the interaction, which
   describes the degree to which an individual's phenotype is influenced by
   the phenotype of its social partners. The genetic identity of social
   partners substantially influences inspection behavior, measures of
   threat assessment, and schooling and does so in positively reinforcing
   manner. We therefore demonstrate strong IGEs for antipredator behavior
   that represent the genetic variation necessary for the evolution of
   reciprocity.}},

Abstract = {{Charles Darwin laid the foundation for all modern work on sexual
   selection in his seminal book The Descent of Man, and Selection in
   Relation to Sex. In this work, Darwin fleshed out the mechanism of
   sexual selection, a hypothesis that he had proposed in The Origin of
   Species. He went well beyond a simple description of the phenomenon by
   providing extensive evidence and considering the far-reaching
   implications of the idea. Here we consider the contributions of Darwin
   to sexual selection with a particular eye on how far we have progressed
   in the last 150 years. We focus on 2 key questions in sexual selection.
   First, why does mate choice evolve at all? And second, what factors
   determine the strength of mate choice (or intensity of sexual selection)
   in each sex? Darwin provided partial answers to these questions, and the
   progress that has been made on both of these topics since his time
   should be seen as one of the great triumphs of modern evolutionary
   biology. However, a review of the literature shows that key aspects of
   sexual selection are still plagued by confusion and disagreement. Many
   of these areas are complex and will require new theory and empirical
   data for complete resolution. Overall, Darwin's contributions are still
   surprisingly relevant to the modern study of sexual selection, so
   students of evolutionary biology would be well advised to revisit his
   works. Although we have made significant progress in some areas of
   sexual selection research, we still have much to accomplish.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection is among the most powerful of all evolutionary forces.
   It occurs when individuals within one sex secure mates and produce
   offspring at the expense of other individuals within the same sex.
   Darwin was first to recognize the power of sexual selection to change
   male and female phenotypes, and, in noting that sexual selection is
   nonubiquitous, Darwin was also first to recognize the importance of
   mating system-the ``special circumstances'' in which reproduction occurs
   within species. Analyses of mating systems since Darwin have emphasized
   either the genetic relationships between male and female mating
   elements, usually among plants, or the numbers of mates males and
   females may obtain, usually among animals. Combining these schemes
   yields a quantitative methodology that emphasizes measurement of the sex
   difference in the variance in relative fitness, as well as phenotypic
   and genetic correlations underlying reproductive traits that may arise
   among breeding pairs. Such information predicts the degree and direction
   of sexual dimorphism within species, it allows the classification of
   mating systems using existing genetic and life history data, and with
   information on the spatial and temporal distributions of fertilizations,
   it may also predict floral morphology in plants. Because this empirical
   framework identifies selective forces and genetic architectures
   responsible for observed male-female differences, it compliments
   discoveries of nucleotide sequence variation and the expression of
   quantitative traits. Moreover, because this methodology emphasizes the
   process of evolutionary change, it is easier to test and interpret than
   frameworks emphasizing parental investment in offspring and its presumed
   evolutionary outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Heritable variation in traits can have wide-ranging impacts on species
   interactions, but the effects that ongoing evolution has on the temporal
   ecological dynamics of communities are not well understood. Here, we
   identify three conditions that, if experimentally satisfied, support the
   hypothesis that evolution by natural selection can drive ecological
   changes in communities. These conditions are: (i) a focal population
   exhibits genetic variation in a trait(s), (ii) there is measurable
   directional selection on the trait(s), and (iii) the trait(s) under
   selection affects variation in a community variable(s). When these
   conditions are met, we expect evolution by natural selection to cause
   ecological changes in the community. We tested these conditions in a
   field experiment examining the interactions between a native plant
   (Oenothera biennis) and its associated arthropod community (more than 90
   spp.). Oenothera biennis exhibited genetic variation in several plant
   traits and there was directional selection on plant biomass,
   life-history strategy (annual versus biennial reproduction) and
   herbivore resistance. Genetically based variation in biomass and
   life-history strategy consistently affected the abundance of common
   arthropod species, total arthropod abundance and arthropod species
   richness. Using two modelling approaches, we show that evolution by
   natural selection in large O. biennis populations is predicted to cause
   changes in the abundance of individual arthropod species, increases in
   the total abundance of arthropods and a decline in the number of
   arthropod species. In small O. biennis populations, genetic drift is
   predicted to swamp out the effects of selection, making the evolution of
   plant populations unpredictable. In short, evolution by natural
   selection can play an important role in affecting the dynamics of
   communities, but these effects depend on several ecological factors. The
   framework presented here is general and can be applied to other systems
   to examine the community-level effects of ongoing evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation in female resistance and tolerance to male mating
   harassment can affect the outcome of sexually antagonistic mating
   interactions. We investigated female mating rates and male mating
   harassment in natural populations of a damselfly (Ischnura elegans).
   This damselfly species has a heritable sex-limited polymorphism in
   females, where one of the morphs is a male mimic (androchrome females).
   The three female morphs differ in mating rates, and these differences
   are stable across populations and years. However, the degree of
   premating resistance toward male mating attempts varied across
   generations and populations. Male mating harassment of the female morphs
   changed in a density-dependent fashion, suggesting that male mate
   preferences are plastic and vary with the different morph densities. We
   quantified morph differences in male mating harassment and female
   fecundity, using path analysis and structural equation modeling. We
   found variation between the morphs in the fitness consequences of
   mating, with the fecundity of one of the nonmimetic morphs declining
   with increasing male mating harassment. However, androchrome females had
   lower overall fecundity, presumably reflecting a cost of male mimicry.
   Density-dependent male mating harassment on the morphs and fecundity
   costs of male mimicry are thus likely to contribute to the maintenance
   of this female polymorphism.}},

Abstract = {{Theory for the evolution of social interactions based on continuous
   strategies often assumes for simplicity that expressed behaviours are
   independent of previous encounters. In reality, however, such
   dependencies are likely to be widespread and often strong, generating
   complex behavioural dynamics. To model this process and illustrate
   potential consequences for the evolution of behavioural interactions, we
   consider the behavioural dynamics of the interaction between caring
   parents and their demanding offspring, a prime example of long series of
   interdependent and highly dynamic interactions. These dynamics can be
   modelled using functions describing mechanisms for how parents and their
   offspring respond to each other in the interaction. We establish the
   general conditions under which the behavioural dynamics converge towards
   a proximate equilibrium and refer to such converging interactions as
   behaviourally stable strategies (BSSs). We further demonstrate that
   there is scope for behavioural instability under realistic conditions;
   that is, whenever parents and/or offspring `overreact' beyond some
   threshold. By applying the derived condition for behavioural stability
   to evolutionary models of parent-offspring conflict resolution, we show
   by numerical simulations that evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) of
   current models are not necessarily behaviourally stable. Because
   behavioural instability implies that expressed levels of behaviours
   deviate from the ESS, behavioural stability is required for strict
   evolutionary stability in repeated behavioural interactions. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Although parental care is generally rare among reptiles, nest-guarding
   occurs in some species and is usually attributed to defense against nest
   predation. Nest-guarding also occurs in the Tuatara (Sphenodon
   punctatus), but nest predation on rodent-free islands does not appear to
   be a significant threat to nesting success in this species. We studied a
   population of colonially nesting Tuatara on rodent-free Stephens Island,
   New Zealand, over four years and tested the hypothesis that female
   Tuatara guard their nests to defend them from excavation by conspecific
   females. We located 73 nests for which females could be assigned based
   on observations during oviposition. Nearly 25\% of these nests were
   subsequently excavated by another female, but only 56\% of the nests
   were guarded by the females that constructed them. We found a trend
   where guarded nests were less likely to be excavated than unguarded
   nests. Females were more likely to guard their nests, and guarded nests
   for longer, as the activity of other females on the date of oviposition
   increased. Nest-guarding in Tuatara appears to be adaptive in that it
   tends to reduce the likelihood of nest excavation by other females, but
   social interactions may affect females' propensity to guard, because
   guarding behavior was influenced by the activity of conspecifics at the
   time of oviposition.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Social status is an important phenotypic trait that determines
   fitness-relevant parameters. In many mammalian societies, offspring
   acquire a social position at adulthood similar to that held by their
   mother ({''}rank inheritance{''}) and thus obtain fitness benefits
   associated with this status. Mothers may influence the rank of their
   offspring at adulthood in at least three distinct ways. Firstly, the
   direct genetic inheritance of maternal traits that influence resource
   holding potential might predispose offspring to obtain a rank similar to
   that held by their mother. Secondly, the prenatal maternal environment
   might influence offspring rank if fetal exposure to maternal androgens
   is related to maternal status and affects offspring competitiveness.
   Thirdly, maternal behavioral support, a component of the postnatal
   maternal environment, may help offspring dominate individuals
   subordinate to their mother, thereby assisting offspring to acquire a
   rank similar to that of their mother. Here, we simultaneously test
   predictions derived from these three potential maternal effects on
   offspring rank acquisition at adulthood, using cases of offspring
   adoption in the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta. We demonstrate that the
   rank of adopted offspring at adulthood was similar to that of their
   surrogate mother and that the competitive ability of offspring at
   adulthood was best explained by postnatal maternal behavioral support.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that maintain genetic
   variation in natural populations is one of the fundamental goals of
   evolutionary biology. There is growing evidence that
   genotype-by-environment interaction (G x E) can maintain additive
   genetic variance (V (A)), but we lack information on the relative
   performance of genotypes under the competitive situations encountered in
   the field. Competing genotypes may influence each other, and this
   interaction is also subject to selection through indirect genetic
   effects (IGE). Here, we explore how genotypes perform when interacting
   and evaluate IGE in order to understand its influence on V (A) for
   sexually-selected traits in the lesser waxmoth, Achroia grisella. We
   found that inter-genotype differences and crossover interactions under
   joint rearing are equal to or greater than values when reared
   separately. A focal genotype exhibited different performances when
   jointly reared with various genotypes-suggesting that IGE may be
   responsible for the increased levels of crossover and differences in
   performance observed. We suggest that some genotypes are superior
   competitors for food acquisition in the larval stage, and that these
   differences influence the development and evolution of other genotypes
   through IGE. We reaffirm the role of G x E in maintaining V (A) and note
   the general importance of IGE in studies of evolutionary mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive investment decisions form an integral part of life-history
   biology. Selection frequently favours plasticity in investment that can
   generate maternal effects on offspring development. For example, if
   females differentially allocate resources based on mate attractiveness
   or quality, this can create a non-genetic link between mate
   attractiveness and offspring fitness with potential consequences for
   ecological and evolutionary dynamics. It is therefore important to
   understand under what conditions differential investment into offspring
   in relation to male quality is expected to occur and the direction of
   the effect. Two opposite predictions, increased investment into
   offspring produced with high-quality mates ( differential allocation
   (DA)) and increased investment with low-quality males ( reproductive
   compensation ( RC)) have been suggested but no formal theoretical
   treatment justifying the assumptions underlying these two hypotheses has
   been conducted to date. Here, we used a state-based approach to
   investigate the circumstances under which the variation in mate quality
   results in differential female investment into offspring and how this
   interacts with female energetic resource levels. We found that a pattern
   of increased investment when mating with high-quality mates (i.e. DA)
   was the most common optimal investment strategy for females in our
   model. By contrast, increased investment when mating with low-quality
   mates (i.e. RC) was predicted only when the relative impact of parental
   investment on offspring quality was low. Finally, we found that the
   specific pattern of investment in relation to male quality depends on
   female energetic state, the likelihood for future mating opportunities
   and the expected future distribution of mate quality. Thus, the female's
   age and body condition should be important factors mediating DA and RC,
   which may help to explain the equivocal results of empirical studies.}},

Abstract = {{Sperm competition is a pervasive force. One adaptation is the male
   ability to displace the rivals' sperm that females have stored from
   previous copulations. In the damselfly, Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis
   asturica, males with wider aedeagi displace more spermathecal sperm. The
   present study documents that the same mechanism operates in another
   damselfly, Hetaerina americana. However, this genital width in both
   species decreases along the season, but late-emerging females have more
   sperm displaced than early-emerging females. Because territorial males
   mated more and were larger in body and genital size than nonterritorial
   males, late-season females mated with considerably larger males with
   respect to female size and this produced higher sperm displacement.
   Assuming female benefits from storing sperm but that such benefit does
   not prevail if males displace sperm, it is predicted that, along the
   season, females will mate less and male harassment (in terms of male
   mating attempts and oviposition duration) will increase. These
   predictions were corroborated. In H. americana, it was also tested
   whether spermathecal sperm became less viable along the season. The
   results obtained did not corroborate this. This is the first evidence
   indicating that season affects sperm displacement ability and female
   mating frequency due to changes in male body and genital size. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Social interactions pervade all aspects of life in the social insects.
   Networks of interacting nestmates enable the maintenance of colony
   homeostasis and regulation of brood development. Artificial colony-level
   selection on the amount of pollen stored in honeybee colonies has
   produced high- and low-pollen-hoarding strains that have been used as a
   model system to study the genetic and physiological basis of differences
   in forager behavior that contribute to colony-level differences in
   pollen hoarding. Here we extend this model system using an
   interacting-phenotypes approach that explicitly studies genetic
   components arising from social interactions. High- and
   low-pollen-hoarding-strain larvae were reared in hives with high- or
   low-strain older larvae and high- or low-strain adult workers. The
   ovariole number and dry mass of focal individuals depended on
   interactions between the genotypes of the focal individuals and their
   brood and adult worker nestmates. These results show that trait
   expression by individual honeybee workers is modulated by the genotypic
   composition of the colony, indicating that individual-level phenotypes
   are properties of the composite ``sociogenome.{''} Thus, colony-level
   selection has produced strains with distinct combinations of socially
   interacting genes, which make up the social networks that regulate
   development and expressed phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Aggressive behaviours are necessarily expressed in a social context,
   such that individuals may be influenced by the phenotypes, and
   potentially the genotypes, of their social partners. Consequently, it
   has been hypothesized that indirect genetic effects (IGEs) arising from
   the social environment will provide a major source of heritable
   variation on which selection can act. However, there has been little
   empirical scrutiny of this to date. Here we test this hypothesis in an
   experimental population of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using
   quantitative genetic models of five aggression traits, we find
   repeatable and heritable differences in agonistic behaviours of focal
   individuals when presented with an opponent mouse. For three of the
   traits, there is also support for the presence of IGEs, and estimated
   correlations between direct and indirect genetic (rA(O,F)) effects were
   high. As a consequence, any selection for aggression in the focal
   individuals should cause evolution of the social environment as a
   correlated response. In two traits, strong positive rA(O,F) will cause
   the rapid evolution of aggression, while in a third case changes in the
   phenotypic mean will be constrained by negative covariance between
   direct and IGEs. Our results illustrate how classical analyses may miss
   important components of heritable variation, and show that a full
   understanding of evolutionary dynamics requires explicit consideration
   of the genetic component of the social environment.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical communication mediates social interactions in insects {[}1].
   For the fruit fly, D. melanogaster, the chemical display is a key
   fitness trait because it leads to mating. An exchange of cues that
   resembles a dialogue between males and females is enacted by pheromones,
   chemical signals that pass between individual flies to alter physiology
   and behavior {[}2, 3]. Chemical signals also affect the timing of
   locomotor activity {[}4] and sleep {[}5]. We investigated genetic and
   environmental determinants of chemical communication. To evaluate the
   role of the social environment, we extracted a chemical blend from
   individual males selected from groups composed of one genotype and
   compared these extracts to those from groups of mixed genotypes. To
   evaluate the role of the physical environment, these comparisons were
   performed under a light-dark cycle or in constant darkness. Here, we
   show that chemical signaling is affected by the social environment,
   light-dark cycle, and genotype as well as the complex interplay of these
   variables. Gene-by-environment interactions produce highly significant
   effects on chemical signaling. We also examined individual responses
   within the groups. Strikingly, the response of one wild-type fly to
   another is modulated by the genotypic composition of his neighbors.
   Chemical signaling in D. melanogaster may be a ``fickle{''} trait that
   depends on the individual's social background.}},

Abstract = {{In theory, females of many species choose mates based on traits that are
   indicators of male genetic quality. A fundamental question in
   evolutionary biology is why genetic variation for such indicator traits
   persists despite strong persistent selection imposed by female
   preference, which is known as the lek paradox. One potential solution to
   the lek paradox suggests that the traits that are targets of mate choice
   should evolve condition-dependent expression and that condition should
   have a large genetic variance. Condition is expected to exhibit high
   genetic variance because it is affected by a large number of
   physiological processes and hence, condition-dependent traits should
   `capture' variation contributed by a large number of loci. We suggest
   that a potentially important cause of variation in condition is
   competition for limited resources. Here, we discuss a pair of models to
   analyze the evolutionary genetics of traits affected by success in
   social competition for resources. We show that competition can
   contribute to genetic variation of `competition-dependent' traits that
   have fundamentally different evolutionary properties than other sources
   of variation. Competition dependence can make traits honest indicators
   of genetic quality by revealing the relative competitive ability of
   males, can provide a component of heritable variation that does not
   contribute to trait evolution, and can help maintain heritable variation
   under directional selection. of competition dependence and briefly
   introduce two models to demonstrate the potential evolutionary
   consequences of competition-dependent trait expression.}},

Abstract = {{Kin and levels-of-selection models are common approaches for modelling
   social evolution. Indirect genetic effect (IGE) models represent a
   different approach, specifying social effects on trait values rather
   than fitness. We investigate the joint effect of relatedness, multilevel
   selection and IGEs on response to selection. We present a measure for
   the degree of multilevel selection, which is the natural partner of
   relatedness in expressions for response. Response depends on both
   relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection, rather than only one
   or the other factor. Moreover, response is symmetric in relatedness and
   the degree of multilevel selection, indicating that both factors have
   exactly the same effect. Without IGEs, the key parameter is the product
   of relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection. With IGEs,
   however, multilevel selection without relatedness can explain evolution
   of social traits. Thus, next to relatedness and multilevel selection,
   IGEs are a key element in the genetical theory of social evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of the complex and dynamic behavioural interactions
   between caring parents and their dependent offspring is a major area of
   research in behavioural ecology and quantitative genetics. While
   behavioural ecologists examine the evolution of interactions between
   parents and offspring in the light of parent-offspring conflict and its
   resolution, quantitative geneticists explore the evolution of such
   interactions in the light of parent-offspring co-adaptation due to
   combined effects of parental and offspring behaviours on fitness. To
   date, there is little interaction or integration between these two
   fields. Here, we first review the merits and limitations of each of
   these two approaches and show that they provide important complementary
   insights into the evolution of strategies for offspring begging and
   parental resource provisioning. We then outline how central ideas from
   behavioural ecology and quantitative genetics can be combined within a
   framework based on the concept of behavioural reaction norms, which
   provides a common basis for behavioural ecologists and quantitative
   geneticists to study the evolution of parent-offspring interactions.
   Finally, we discuss how the behavioural reaction norm approach can be
   used to advance our understanding of parent-offspring conflict by
   combining information about the genetic basis of traits from
   quantitative genetics with key insights regarding the adaptive function
   and dynamic nature of parental and offspring behaviours from behavioural
   ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of postcopulatory sexual selection typically estimate a male's
   fertilization success from his paternity success (P-2) calculated at
   hatching or birth. However, P-2 may be affected by differential embryo
   viability, thereby confounding estimations of true fertilization success
   (F-2) This study examines the effects of variation in the ability of
   males to influence embryo viability upon the inequality between P-2 and
   F-2. It also investigates the consequences of this inequality for
   testing the hypothesis that polyandrous females accrue viability
   benefits for their offspring through facilitation of sperm competition
   (good-sperm model). Simulations of competitive mating trials show that
   although relative measures of male reproductive success tend to
   underestimate the strength of underlying good-sperm processes,
   good-sperm processes can be seriously overestimated using P-2 values if
   males influence the viability of the embryos they sire. This study
   cautions the interpretation of P-2 values as a proxy for fertilization
   success or sperm competitiveness in studies of postcopulatory sexual
   selection, and highlights that the good-sperm hypothesis needs empirical
   support from studies able to identify and separate unequivocally the
   males' ability to win fertilizations from their ability to influence the
   development of embryos.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection requires social interactions, particularly between the
   sexes. When trait expression is influenced by social interactions, such
   traits are called interacting phenotypes and only recently have the
   evolutionary consequences of interacting phenotypes been considered.
   Here we investigated how variation in relative fitness, or the
   opportunity for sexual selection, affected the evolutionary trajectories
   of interacting phenotypes. We used experimentally evolved populations of
   the naturally promiscuous Drosophila pseudoobscura, in which the numbers
   of potential interactions between the sexes, and therefore relative
   fitness, were manipulated by altering natural levels of female
   promiscuity. We considered two different mating interactions between the
   sexes: mating speed and copulation duration. We investigated the
   evolutionary trajectories of means and (co)variances (P) and also the
   influence of genetic drift on the evolutionary response of these
   interactions. Our sexual selection treatments did not affect the means
   of either mating speed or copulation duration, but they did affect P. We
   found that the means of both traits differed among replicates within
   each selection treatment whereas the Ps did not. Changes as a
   consequence of genetic drift were excluded. Our results show that
   although variable potential strengths of sexual interactions influence
   the evolution of interacting phenotypes, the influence may be nonlinear.}},

Abstract = {{Explaining how interactions between genes and the environment influence
   social behavior is a fundamental research goal, yet there is limited
   relevant information for species exhibiting natural variation in social
   organization. The fire ant Solenopsis invicta is characterized by a
   remarkable form of social polymorphism, with the presence of one or
   several queens per colony and the expression of other phenotypic and
   behavioral differences being completely associated with allelic
   variation at a single Mendelian factor marked by the gene Gp-9.
   Microarray analyses of adult workers revealed that differences in the
   Gp-9 genotype are associated with the differential expression of an
   unexpectedly small number of genes, many of which have predicted
   functions, implying a role in chemical communication relevant to the
   regulation of colony queen number. Even more surprisingly, worker gene
   expression profiles are more strongly influenced by indirect effects
   associated with the Gp-9 genotypic composition within their colony than
   by the direct effect of their own Gp-9 genotype. This constitutes an
   unusual example of an ``extended phenotype'' and suggests a complex

Volume = {{179}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{899-905}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Threshold models are useful for understanding the evolution of dimorphic
   traits with polygenic bases. Selection for threshold characters on
   individuals is expected to be frequency dependent because of the
   peculiar way that selection views underlying genetic and environmental
   factors. Selection among individuals is inefficient because individual
   phenotypes fall into only two discrete categories that map imperfectly
   to the underlying genes. Incidence, however, can be continuously
   distributed among groups, making among-group selection relatively more
   efficient. Differently put, the group-mean phenotype can be a better
   predictor of an individual's genotype than that individual's own
   phenotype. Because evolution in group-structured populations is governed
   by the balance of selection within and between groups, we can expect
   threshold traits to evolve in fundamentally different ways when group
   mean fitness is a function of morph frequency. We extend the theory of
   selection on threshold traits to include group selection using
   contextual analysis. For the simple case of linear group-fitness
   functions, we show that the group-level component of selection, like the
   individual-level component, is frequency dependent. However, the
   conditions that determine which component dominates when levels of
   selection are in conflict (as described by Hamilton's rule) are not
   frequency dependent. Thus, enhanced group selection is not an inherent
   property of threshold characters. Nevertheless, we show that predicting
   the effects of multiple levels of selection on dimorphic traits requires
   special considerations of the threshold model.}},

Title = {{The relative nature of fertilization success: Implications for the study
   of post-copulatory sexual selection}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The determination of genetic variation in sperm competitive
   ability is fundamental to distinguish between post-copulatory sexual
   selection models based on good-genes vs compatible genes. The sexy-sperm
   and the good-sperm hypotheses for the evolution of polyandry require
   additive (intrinsic) effects of genes influencing sperm competitiveness,
   whereas the genetic incompatibility hypothesis invokes non-additive
   genetic effects. A male's sperm competitive ability is typically
   estimated from his fertilization success, a measure that is dependent on
   the ability of rival sperm competitors to fertilize the ova. It is well
   known that fertilization success may be conditional to genotypic
   interactions among males as well as between males and females. However,
   the consequences of effects arising from the random sampling of sperm
   competitors upon the estimation of genetic variance in sperm
   competitiveness have been overlooked. Here I perform simulations of
   mating trials performed in the context of sibling analysis to
   investigate whether the ability to detect additive genetic variance
   underlying the sperm competitiveness phenotype is hindered by the
   relative nature of fertilization success measurements.
   Results: Fertilization success values render biased sperm competitive
   ability values. Furthermore, asymmetries among males in the errors
   committed when estimating sperm competitive abilities are likely to
   exist as long as males exhibit variation in sperm competitiveness.
   Critically, random effects arising from the relative nature of
   fertilization success lead to an underestimation of underlying additive
   genetic variance in sperm competitive ability.
   Conclusion: The results show that, regardless of the existence of
   genotypic interactions affecting the output of sperm competition,
   fertilization success is not a perfect predictor of sperm competitive
   ability because of the stochasticity of the background used to obtain
   fertilization success measures. Random effects need to be considered in
   the debate over the maintenance of genetic variation in sperm
   competitiveness, and when testing good-genes and compatible-genes
   processes as explanations of polyandrous behaviour using
   repeatability/heritability data in sperm competitive ability. These
   findings support the notion that the genetic incompatibility hypothesis
   needs to be treated as an alternative hypothesis, rather than a null
   hypothesis, in studies that fail to detect intrinsic sire effects on the
   sperm competitiveness phenotype.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{The evolutionary forces shaping the ability to win competitive
   interactions, such as aggressive encounters, are still poorly
   understood. Given a fitness advantage for competitive success, variance
   in aggressive and sexual display traits should be depleted, but a great
   deal of variation in these traits is consistently found. While life
   history tradeoffs have been commonly cited as a mechanism for the
   maintenance of variation, the variability of competing strategies of
   conspecifics may mean there is no single optimum strategy. We measured
   the genetically determined outcomes of aggressive interactions, and the
   resulting effects on mating success, in a panel of diverse inbred lines
   representing both natural variation and artificially selected genotypes.
   Males of one genotype which consistently lost territorial encounters
   with other genotypes were nonetheless successful against males that were
   artificially selected for supernormal aggression and dominated all other
   lines. Intransitive patterns of territorial success could maintain
   variation in aggressive strategies if there is a preference for
   territorial males. Territorial success was not always associated with
   male mating success however and females preferred `winners' among some
   male genotypes, and `losers' among other male genotypes. This suggests
   that studying behaviour from the perspective of population means may
   provide limited evolutionary and genetic insight. Overall patterns of
   competitive success among males and mating transactions between the
   sexes are consistent with mechanisms proposed for the maintenance of
   genetic variation due to nonlinear outcomes of competitive interactions.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Selective regimes and phenotypic optima could either change smoothly and
   in a clinal fashion or be spatially organized in a more unpredictable
   mosaic pattern over the geographic landscape. When natural or sexual
   selection is driven by intra- or interspecific biotic interactions,
   fine-grained spatial variation in selective regimes could result in
   selection mosaics rather than clinal variation in selection. We
   investigated temporal variation and spatial organization in sexual
   selection on male body size along an ecological coastal-inland gradient
   of a polymorphic damselfly Ischnura elegans. Body size increased in a
   clinal fashion along this gradient: animals were smaller in size at the
   coast, but became larger in the inland areas. In contrast, the sexual
   selection regimes on male body size showed evidence of more fine-grained
   spatial organization with no evidence for a clinal pattern and low
   spatial autocorrelations between populations. These spatially
   fine-grained sexual selection regimes varied in sign and magnitude and
   were driven by a combination of the densities of heritable female color
   morphs and local female body sizes. We suggest that the spatial
   organization of the selective regimes can be interpreted as a sexual
   selection mosaic that is influenced by highly localized density- and
   frequency-dependent social interactions.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In addition to sexual selection, selection resulting from social
   interactions in contexts other than mating can be a potent evolutionary
   force. Such social selection processes are facilitated whenever
   individual fitness varies as a result of any form of social
   interactions. The choice of social partners for communal care of young
   is such a situation in which interactants potentially experience fitness
   variance. In this study, we investigated the existence and impact of
   female social partner choice and the potential for social selection to
   occur in the cooperatively breeding wild house mouse, Mus domesticus. We
   analysed patterns of individual associations in groups of females, and
   compared the reproductive behaviour of females grouped with either a
   preferred or a nonpreferred social partner over an experimental life
   span of half a year, using spatial association as a measure of
   preference. We predicted low reproductive competition among preferred
   social partners and high competition, reflected in lower reproductive
   success, among nonpreferred. Our results showed that female house mice
   displayed nonrandom preferences, and that social partner choice yielded
   significant fitness benefits females in pairs with a preferred partner
   had a significantly higher probability to give birth and to establish an
   egalitarian, cooperative relationship, resulting in higher reproductive
   success than females in nonpreferred pairs. This suggests that
   interactions among females are subject to social selection processes,
   driving the evolution of female traits. (c) 2007 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Although soil microbial communities are known to play crucial roles in
   the cycling of nutrients in forest ecosystems and can vary by plant
   species, how microorganisms respond to the subtle gradients of plant
   genetic variation is just beginning to be appreciated. Using a model
   Populus system in a common garden with replicated clones of known
   genotypes, we evaluated microbial biomass and community composition as
   quantitative traits. Two main patterns emerged. (1) Plant genotype
   influenced microbial biomass nitrogen in soils under replicated
   genotypes of Populus angustifolia, F-1, and backcross hybrids, but not
   P. fremontii. Genotype explained up to 78\% of the variation in
   microbial biomass as indicated by broad-sense heritability estimates (i.
   e., clonal repeatability). A second estimate of microbial biomass (
   total phospholipid fatty acid) was more conservative and showed
   significant genotype effects in P. angustifolia and backcross hybrids.
   (2) Plant genotype significantly influenced microbial community
   composition, explaining up to 70\% of the variation in community
   composition within P. angustifolia genotypes alone. These findings
   suggest that variation in above- and belowground traits of individual
   plant genotypes can alter soil microbial dynamics, and suggests that
   further investigations of the evolutionary implications of genetic

Abstract = {{Social heterosis is when individuals in groups or neighbourhoods receive
   a mutualistic benefit from across-individual genetic diversity. Although
   it can be a viable evolutionary mechanism to maintain allelic diversity
   at a given locus, its efficacy at maintaining genome-wide diversity is
   in question when multiple loci are being simultaneously selected.
   Therefore, we modelled social heterosis in a population of haploid
   genomes of two- or three-linked loci. With such linkages, social
   heterosis decreases gametic diversity, but maintains allelic diversity.
   Genomes tend to survive as complimentary pairs, with alternate alleles
   at each locus (e.g. the pair AbC and aBc). The outcomes of selection
   appear similar to fitness epistasis but are novel in the sense that
   phenotypic interactions occur across rather than within individuals. The
   model's results strongly suggest that strong linkage across gene loci
   actually increases the probability that social heterosis maintains
   significant genetic diversity at the level of the genome.}},

Abstract = {{Inbred lines are an important tool of genetic studies of all traits,

   however, little is known about actual levels of inbreeding in any of
   these strains or whether these lines differ in genetic traits that have
   not been under strong directional artificial selection. We genotyped
   five designer strains of guppies known to vary in their responses to
   predator cues and a wild reference population to determine whether
   designer strains show evidence of inbreeding and whether the strains
   differed from each other at five microsatellite loci. The designer
   strains exhibited lower allelic diversity and observed heterozygosity
   than the wild population. Observed heterozygosity departed significantly
   from expected heterozygosity for most markers in all five strains of
   designer guppies. Inbreeding coefficient (f) comparisons between the
   wild reference population and the designer strains show considerable
   inbreeding in the designer strains. F-is values for the designer strains
   also provide evidence of inbreeding. Finally, F-st values indicate that
   the designer strains differ significantly from each other and the wild

   useful tools for genetic studies of behavioral or life history traits.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely assumed that male sperm competitiveness evolves adaptively.
   However, recent studies have found a cytoplasmic genetic component to
   phenotypic variation in some sperm traits presumed important in sperm
   competition. As cytoplasmic genes are maternally transmitted, they
   cannot respond to selection on sperm and this constraint may affect the
   scope in which sperm competitiveness can evolve adaptively. We examined
   nuclear and cytoplasmic genetic contributions to sperm competitiveness,
   using populations of Callosobruchus maculatus carrying orthogonal
   combinations of nuclear and cytoplasmic lineages. Our design also
   enabled us to examine genetic contributions to female remating. We found
   that sperm competitiveness and remating are primarily encoded by nuclear
   genes. In particular, a male's sperm competitiveness phenotype was
   contingent on an interaction between the competing male genotypes.
   Furthermore, cytoplasmic effects were detected on remating but not sperm
   competitiveness, suggesting that cytoplasmic genes do not generally play
   a profound evolutionary role in sperm competition.}},

Abstract = {{Natural and sexual selection are crucial factors in the evolutionary
   process, yet recent reviews show that researchers have focused narrowly
   on this topic, with the majority of research centered on the
   morphological traits of single species. However, in the past several
   years, several bodies of work have emerged that have examined both
   selection on performance capacity and selection in a community context,
   and our goal is to highlight these two growing areas and point toward
   future directions. Recent studies of selection on performance capacity
   point toward directional selection favoring high levels of performance,
   and we detected less evidence for selection favoring intermediate (i.
   e., stabilizing) or bimodal (i. e., disruptive) kinds of performance
   levels. Studies of selection in a community context, using the paradigm
   of indirect genetic effects, show significant community heritability and
   strong capacity for evolution to occur in a community context via the
   force of natural selection. For future directions, we argue that
   researchers should shift toward longer-term studies of selection on both
   individual species and communities, and we also encourage researchers to
   publish negative selection results for both performance and community
   studies to act as balancing influences on published positive selection
   results.}},

   Genomes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{Epistasis arising from physiological interactions between gene products
   often contributes to species differences, particularly those involved in
   reproductive isolation. In social organisms, phenotypes are influenced
   by the genotypes of multiple interacting individuals. In theory, social
   interactions can give rise to an additional type of epistasis between
   the genomes of social partners that can contribute to species
   differences. Using a full-factorial cross-fostering design with three
   species of closely related Temnothorax ants, I found that adult worker
   size was determined by an interaction between the genotypes of
   developing brood and care-giving workers, i.e. intergenomic epistasis.
   Such intergenomic social epistasis provides a strong signature of
   coevolution between social partners. These results demonstrate that just
   as physiologically interacting genes coevolve, diverge, and contribute
   to species differences, so do socially interacting genes. Coevolution
   and conflict between social partners, especially relatives such as
   parents and offspring, has long been recognized as having widespread
   evolutionary effects. This coevolutionary process may often result in
   coevolved socially-interacting gene complexes that contribute to species
   differences.}},

Abstract = {{Many conspicuous ornamental traits in animals are expressed in both
   males and females. Despite this, most research has focused on sexually
   dimorphic ornamentation. Mutual ornamentation has often been viewed as a
   result of either a nonadaptive genetic correlation between the sexes or
   similar selection pressures in both sexes. Here, we review the
   theoretical underpinning and empirical evidence for these ideas. Few
   studies have attempted to test empirically whether a genetic correlation
   between the sexes can constrain the evolution of sexual dimorphism, and
   the results have been mixed. By contrast, there is good evidence that
   mutual ornaments can have a signal function in both sexes, especially in
   terms of mate choice. Other possible signalling functions have received
   little attention. Social status signalling is especially likely to be
   important, because competition over nonsexual resources is more balanced
   between the sexes than sexual competition. There is a need for
   experimental studies that explicitly test these hypotheses
   simultaneously in both sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects facilitate adaptation to changing environments because
   they alter individual offspring traits to match current conditions. We
   show that maternal effects can also resolve context-dependent,
   correlational selection on multiple offspring traits, promoting
   adaptation to more complex environments. In side-blotched lizards (Uta
   stansburiana), two alternative pathways of dorsal pattern induction
   involve maternal oestradiol and alleles for throat colouration (similar
   to social strategy). In one pathway, females increased yolk oestradiol
   when mated to yellow-throated sires; oestradiol induced dorsal barring
   in yellow-throated progeny of both sexes. In another pathway, females
   elevated yolk oestradiol in response to a high frequency of orange
   alleles in experimental social neighbourhoods. When the sire lacked
   yellow alleles, this secondary pathway resulted in striped, orange sons
   and striped, non-orange daughters. All maternally induced types had high
   fitness in the wild. These results illustrate a (previously undescribed)

Abstract = {{Agonistic stress (AS) is normally associated with the suppression of

   AS using longitudinal data from a large sample (n = 9731) of young
   adults in the United States. We find that repeated exposure to AS is
   associated with early fertility, higher fertility over a 10-year period,
   and low investment in long-term mating relationships. The association of
   AS with early fertility and mating behavior is mediated by antisocial
   preferences. However, the positive association between AS and fertility
   behavior over the long run is robust with respect to the controls in the
   model. We believe that our findings align well with studies showing
   increased reproductive effort in response to agonistic interactions with

Abstract = {{Nonadditive effects of group membership are generated when individuals

   Individuals from two strains were tested for response to a model

   behaviour in response to social context and bow group phenotype relates
   to individual behaviour. Nonadditive effects of group membership were
   detected for a number of behaviours, revealing that the effect of being
   in a group differed among individuals. These nonadditive effects,
   however, yielded an additive group phenotype. That is, the average
   behaviour of the group was equal to the average of its parts, for all

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects arise when genes expressed in one individual
   affect the expression of traits in other individuals. The importance of
   indirect genetic effects has been recognized for a diversity of
   evolutionary processes including kin selection, sexual selection,
   community structure and multilevel selection, but data regarding their
   genetic architecture and prevalence throughout the genome remain scarce,
   especially for interactions between unrelated individuals. Using a set
   of 411 Bay-0 x Shahdara Arabidopsis recombinant inbred lines grown with
   Landsberg neighbours, we examined quantitative trait loci (QTL) having
   direct and indirect effects on size, developmental, and fitness related
   traits. Using an interval mapping approach, we identified 15 QTL with
   direct effects and found that 13 of these QTL had significant indirect
   effects on trait expression in neighbouring plants. These results
   suggest widespread pleiotropy, as nearly all direct effect QTL have
   associated pleiotropic indirect effects. Paradoxically, most indirect
   effects were of the same sign as direct effects, creating a pattern of
   nearly universal positive pleiotropy that makes most covariances between
   direct and indirect effects positive. These results are consistent with
   a complex genetic basis for intraspecific interactions, but suggest that
   interactions between neighbouring plants are largely positive, rather
   than negative as would be expected for competition. In addition to their
   evolutionary and ecological importance, these pleiotropic relationships
   between DGE and IGE loci have implications for quantitative genetic
   studies of natural populations as well as experimental design
   considerations. Additionally, studies that ignore IGEs may over- or
   underestimate quantitative genetic parameters, as well as the effect of
   and variance contributed by QTL.}},

Abstract = {{Females often prefer males with elaborate traits, even when they receive
   no direct benefits from their choice. In such situations, mate
   discrimination presumably has genetic advantages; selective females will
   produce offspring of higher genetic quality. Over time, persistent
   female preferences for elaborate secondary-sexual traits in males should
   erode genetic variance in these traits, eventually eliminating any
   benefit to the preferences. Yet, strong female preferences persist in
   many taxa. This puzzle is called the lek paradox and raises two primary
   questions: do females obtain genetic benefits for offspring by selecting
   males with elaborate secondary-sexual characteristics and, if so, how is
   the genetic variation in these male traits maintained? We suggest that
   indirect genetic effects may help to resolve the lek paradox. Maternal
   phenotypes, such as habitat selection behaviours and offspring
   provisioning, often influence the condition and the expression of
   secondary-sexual traits in sons. These maternal influences are commonly
   genetic based (i.e. they are indirect genetic effects). Females choosing
   mates with elaborate traits may receive `good genes' for daughters in
   the form of effective maternal characteristics. Recognizing the
   significance of indirect genetic effects may be important to our
   understanding of the process and consequences of sexual selection.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock populations are usually kept in groups. As a consequence,
   social interactions among individuals affect productivity, health, and
   welfare. Current selection methods (individual selection), however,
   ignore those interactions and yield suboptimal or in some cases even
   negative responses. In principle, selection between groups instead of
   individuals offers a solution, but has rarely been adopted in practice
   for two reasons. First, the relationship between group selection theory
   and common animal breeding concepts, such as the accuracy of selection,
   is nuclear. Second, application of group selection requires keeping
   selection candidates ill groups, which is often undesirable in practice.
   This work has two objectives. First, we derive expressions for the
   accuracy of individual and group selection, which provides a measurement
   of quality for those methods. Second, we investigate the opportunity to
   improve traits affected by interactions by rising information oil
   relatives kept. in family groups, while keeping selection candidates
   individually. The accuracy of selection based oil relatives is shown to
   be all analogy of the classical expression for traits not, affected by
   interactions. Our results show that selection based on relatives offers
   good opportunities for effective genetic improvement of traits affected
   by interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Although females are expected to maximize their reproductive success
   with only one or a few matings {[}1], the females of many species mate
   with multiple partners {[}2]. Experimental studies have found evidence
   for an increase in egg or embryo viability when females mate
   polyandrously {[}3]. These studies have been interpreted in the context
   of genetic-benefit models that propose that multiple mating increases
   offspring viability because it allows females to select male genotypes
   that influence viability directly or because it allows females to avoid
   genetic incompatibility {[}2, 4-8]. However, no studies have examined
   directly the precise mechanisms by which parents influence embryo
   viability. Using a morphological marker that enabled us to determine
   paternity and survival of embryos sired by individual male crickets in
   both sperm-competitive and -noncompetitive situations, we show that
   males inducing high embryo viability enhance the viability of embryos
   sired by inferior males. These results indicate that paternal effects
   and interacting phenotypes determine embryo viability. They show that a
   male's reproductive success is modified by the interaction between
   indirect genetic effects of sperm competitors. Importantly, our findings
   show that the benefits accruing to offspring of multiply mated females
   need not be transmitted genetically.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions among individuals are universal, both in animals and in
   plants and in natural as well as domestic populations. Understanding the
   consequences of these interactions for the evolution of populations by
   either natural or artificial selection requires knowledge of the
   heritable components underlying them. Here we present statistical
   methodology to estimate the genetic parameters determining response to
   multilevel selection of traits affected by interactions among
   individuals in general populations. We apply these methods to obtain
   estimates of genetic parameters for survival, days in a population of
   layer chickens with high mortality due to pecking behavior. We find that
   heritable variation is threefold greater than that obtained from
   classical analyses, meaning that two-thirds of the full heritable
   variation is hidden to classical analysis due to social interactions. As
   a consequence, predicted responses to multilevel selection applied to
   this population are threefold greater than classical predictions. This
   work, combined with the quantitative genetic theory for response to
   multilevel selection presented in an accompanying article in this issue,
   enables the design of selection programs to effectively reduce
   competitive interactions in livestock and plants and the prediction of
   the effects of social interactions on evolution in natural populations
   undergoing multilevel selection.}},

Abstract = {{When social interactions occur, the phenotype of an individual is
   influenced directly by its own genes (direct genetic effects) but also
   indirectly by genes expressed in social partners (indirect genetic
   effects). Social insect colonies are characterized by extensive
   behavioral interactions among workers, brood, and queens so that
   indirect genetic effects are particularly relevant. I used a series of
   experimental manipulations to disentangle the contribution of direct
   effects, maternal (queen) effects, and sibsocial (worker) effects to
   variation for worker, gyne, and male mass; caste ratio; and sex ratio in
   the ant Temnothorax curvispinosus. The results indicate genetic variance
   for direct, maternal, and sibsocial effects for all traits, except for
   male mass there was no significant maternal variance, and for sex ratio
   the variance for direct effects was not separable from maternal variance
   for the primary sex ratio. Estimates of genetic correlations between
   direct, maternal, and sibsocial effects were generally negative,
   indicating that these effects may not evolve independently. These
   results have broad implications for social insect evolution. For
   example, the genetic architecture underlying social insect traits may
   constrain the realization of evolutionary conflicts between social

Abstract = {{Many studies have suggested that reproductive performance improves
   during the pair-bond, which might explain why individuals remate with
   the same partner in many species. However, discussion exists about
   whether the association between reproductive performance and pair-bond
   duration that is reported in these studies reflects a causal
   relationship. Usually it is unclear whether a positive association is
   caused by pairs improving during their pair-bond or by high-quality
   pairs staying together for longer. Furthermore, reproductive performance
   often also depends on the age or breeding experience of parents, which
   all covary with pair-bond duration. A much needed experimental approach
   is lacking so far. We investigated the effect of pair-bond duration on
   reproductive performance in a long-lived monogamous bird species based
   on natural as well as experimental variation. The duration of
   oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) pair-bonds, which were followed
   for 21 years, strongly affected reproductive output, even after
   controlling for effects of age and breeding experience. Pairs improved
   during their pair-bond, and there were no indications of selective
   disappearance of low-quality pairs; however, pairs that stayed together
   for very long performed badly. Experimental removal of one partner
   showed that the reproductive cost of divorce depended on the pair-bond
   duration with the old partner. In addition, after remating, the newly
   formed pairs strongly improved again, independent of the age and
   breeding experience of the remated pair members. As such, this study
   provides the first experimental evidence of a causal effect of pair-bond
   duration on reproductive performance.}},

   Recent studies show that such traits in a common tree have predictable
   effects on community structure and ecosystem processes. Because these
   `community and ecosystem phenotypes' have a genetic basis and are
   heritable, we can begin to apply the principles of population and
   quantitative genetics to place the study of complex communities and
   ecosystems within an evolutionary framework. This framework could allow
   us to understand, for the first time, the genetic basis of ecosystem
   processes, and the effect of such phenomena as climate change and

Abstract = {{The evolutionary analysis of community organization is considered a
   major frontier in biology. Nevertheless, current explanations for
   community structure exclude the effects of genes and selection at levels
   above the individual. Here. we demonstrate a genetic basis for community
   structure, arising from the fitness consequences of genetic interactions
   among species (i.e., interspecific indirect genetic effects or IIGEs).
   Using simulated and natural communities of arthropods inhabiting North
   American cottonwoods (Populus), we show that when species comprising
   ecological communities are summarized using a multivariate statistical
   method, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). the resulting
   univariate scores can be analyzed using standard techniques for
   estimating the heritability of quantitative traits. Our estimates of the
   broad-sense heritability of arthropod communities on known genotypes of
   cottonwood trees in common gardens explained 56-63\% of the total
   variation in community phenotype. To justify and help interpret our
   empirical approach, we modeled synthetic communities in which the
   number, intensity, and fitness consequences of the genetic interactions
   among species comprising the community were explicitly known. Results
   from the model suggest that our empirical estimates of broad-sense
   community heritability arise from heritable variation in a host tree
   trait and the fitness consequences of IGEs that extend from tree trait
   to arthropods. When arthropod traits are heritable, interspecific IGEs
   cause species interactions to change, and community evolution occurs.
   Our results have implications for establishing the genetic foundations
   of communities and ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Spiders do not feed directly on vertebrate blood, but a small East
   African jumping spider (Salticidae), Evarcha culicivora, feeds
   indirectly on vertebrate blood by choosing as preferred prey female
   mosquitoes that have had recent blood meals. Experiments show that this
   spider can identify its preferred prey by sight alone and by odor alone.
   When presented with two types of size-matched motionless lures, E.
   culicivora consistently chose blood-fed female mosquitoes in preference
   to nonmosquito prey, male mosquitoes, and sugar-fed female mosquitoes
   (i.e., females that had not been feeding on blood). When the choice was
   between mosquitoes of different sizes (both blood- or both sugar-fed),
   small juveniles chose the smaller prey, whereas adults and larger
   juveniles chose the larger prey. However, preference for blood took
   precedence over preference for size (i.e., to get a blood meal, small
   individuals took prey that were larger than the preferred size, and
   larger individuals took prey that were smaller than the preferred size).
   When presented with odor from two prey types, E. culicivora approached
   the odor from blood-fed female mosquitoes significantly more often the

Abstract = {{The evolution of parent-offspring interactions for the provisioning of
   care is usually explained as the phenotypic outcome of resolved
   conflicting selection pressures. However, parental care and offspring
   solicitation are expected to have complex patterns of inheritance. Here
   we present a quantitative genetic model of parent-offspring interactions
   that allows us to investigate the evolutionary maintenance of a state of
   resolved conflict. We show that offspring solicitation and parental
   provisioning are expected to become genetically correlated through
   coadaptation and that their genetic architecture is dictated by an
   interaction between patterns of selection and the proximate mechanisms
   regulating supply and demand. When selection is predominately on
   offspring solicitation, our model suggests that the genetic correlations
   between provisioning and solicitation are usually positive if
   provisioning reduces solicitation. Conversely, when selection is
   predominately on parental provisioning, the correlations are mostly
   negative as long as parents show a positive response to offspring
   demand. Empirical estimates of the genetic architecture of traits
   involved in family interactions fit these predictions. Our model
   demonstrates how the evolutionary maintenance of parent-offspring
   interactions can result in variable patterns of coadaptation, and it
   provides an explanation for the diversity of family interactions within

Abstract = {{We discuss the evolutionary origin and elaboration of sociality using an
   indirect genetic effects perspective. Indirect genetic effects models
   simultaneously consider zygotic genes, genes expressed in social
   partners (especially mothers and siblings), and the interactions between
   them. Incorporation of these diverse genetic effects should lead to more
   realistic models of social evolution. We first review haplodiploidy as a
   factor that promotes the evolution of eusociality. Social insect
   biologists have doubted the importance of relatedness asymmetry caused
   by hoplodiploidy and focused on other predisposing factors such as
   maternal care. However, indirect effects theory shows that maternal care
   evolves more readily in haplodiploids, especially with inbreeding and
   despite multiple mating. Because extended maternal care is believed to
   be a precondition for the evolution of eusociality, the evolutionary
   bias towards maternal care in haplodiploids may result in a further bias
   towards eusocialily in these groups. Next, we compare kin selection and
   parental manipulation and then briefly review additional hypotheses for
   the evolutionary origin of eusociality. We present a verbal model for
   the evolutionary origin and elaboration of sib-social care from maternal
   care based on the modification of the timing of expression of maternal
   care behaviors. Specifically, heterochrony genes cause maternal care
   behaviors to be expressed prereproductively towards siblings instead of
   postreproductively towards offspring. Our review demonstrates that both
   maternal effect genes (expressed in a parental manipulation manner) and
   direct effect zygotic genes (expressed in an offspring control manner)
   are likely involved in the evolution of eusociality. We conclude by
   describing theoretical and empirical advances with indirect genetic
   effects and sociogenomics, and me provide specific quantitative genetic
   and genomic predictions from our heterochrony model for the evolutionary
   origin and elaboration of eusociality.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological and evolutionary consequences of host-parasite interactions
   have attracted considerable attention from evolutionary biologists.
   Previous studies have suggested that immune responsiveness may be
   genetically or developmentally linked with colour pattern, such that the
   evolution of animal colour patterns may be influenced by correlated
   responses to selection for parasite resistance. We studied interactions
   between the endoparasitic fly Leiophora innoxia (Meigen) (Diptera:
   Tachinidae) and its colour polymorphic pygmy grasshopper host Tetrix
   undulata (Sow.) (Orthoptera: Tetrigidae) to test for morph-specific
   differences in parasitization and immune defence, and host-induced
   variation in parasite phenotypes. Our results revealed that c. 2 and
   30\% of adult grasshoppers collected from the same natural population in
   two subsequent years, respectively were parasitized. Parasite prevalence
   was independent of host sex and colour morph. Pupae were larger if the
   parasite had developed in a female than in a male host, possibly
   reflecting host resource value or a physical constraint on larval growth
   imposed by host body size. Pupal size was also associated with host
   colour morph, with individuals that had developed in dark morphs being
   smaller at pupation compared to those that developed in paler morphs.
   However, immune defence, measured as the encapsulation response to a
   novel antigen, did not differ among individuals belonging to alternative
   colour morphs or sexes. Darker morphs warm up more quickly and prefer
   higher body temperatures than paler ones. Encapsulation was not
   influenced by maintenance temperature (15 vs. 30 degrees C), however,
   suggesting that indirect effects of coloration on parasite resistance
   mediated via differential body temperature are unlikely. The dependence
   of parasite body size on host colour morph may thus reflect plasticity
   of growth and development of the larvae in response to differential host
   body temperature, rather than variable host immune defence. (c) 2005 The

Abstract = {{Using a set of nine effectively isogenic lines collected from nature in
   1998, we observed unperturbed behaviors of mixed-sex groups of
   Drosophila melanogaster. We repeatedly scanned replicated groups of
   genetically identical individuals, five females and five males, and
   recorded the behavior of each individual (i.e., walking, feeding,
   grooming, flying, courting, mating, fighting, or resting). From these
   behaviors, we made a composite variable of activity for-our quantitative
   genetic analysis. Genotypes differed in activity, explaining 14.41\% of
   the variation in activity; 8.60\% of the variation was explained by a
   significant genotype X sex interaction, which signifies genetic
   variation for sexual dimorphism in behavior. Phenotypic plasticity
   explained 11.13\% of the variation in activity. Different genotypes and
   sexes within genotypes had different rank orders of the component
   behaviors that contribute to activity. We found no effect of common
   rearing environment. Instead, differences between replicate groups
   within genotype accounted for 19.47\% variation in activity, and
   activity was significantly repeatable across scans. This emergent group
   behavior is likely caused by differences between groups of interacting
   individuals, even though individuals were genetically identical across
   groups. Thus, emergent group behavior explained almost as much variation
   in activity as the combined sources of genetic variation (23.01\%), and
   this is an additional level on which selection could operate:
   individuals and groups. We discuss how differences among groups could
   change patterns of additive genetic variation available for evolution.
   Furthermore, because the behavior of an individual is influenced by
   conspecifics, genotype interactions between individuals could contribute
   to indirect selection. Finally, if we consider activity as a syndrome
   governing all component behaviors with strong genetic correlations among
   behaviors within an individual, then these component behaviors cannot
   evolve independently. These results suggest that reductionist approaches
   of molecular behavior genetics may be incomplete and/or misleading when
   considering similar phenotypes at the population level or when trying to
   understand how behaviors evolve.}},

Abstract = {{Different aspects of male quality as a mate can vary independently. When
   this is the case, females may need to use multiple cues to accurately
   assess overall mate quality. We examined the pattern of mating
   preference in the cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea. Sexual conflict occurs in
   this species because male manipulation of female mating receptivity can
   result in reduced female fitness. We predicted that since females cannot
   remate within a single reproductive bout because of male manipulation,
   females should assess male mating history to avoid mating with males
   with low fertility caused by sperm exhaustion. In a mate-preference
   experiment, we found that females discriminated against males who had
   mated multiple times. Females also discriminated against males who had
   consorted with several females but had been prevented from mating with
   those females. Thus, females appeared to be able to detect cues on males
   that were derived from previous mates and to use this information to
   avoid mating with sperm-exhausted males. We suggest that females may
   commonly use multiple cues to assess different aspects of mate quality,
   especially when male quality changes over time. This is an under-studied
   phenomenon that could help explain individual variation in female mating
   preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary conflict arises between reproductive partners when
   alternative reproductive opportunities are available. Sexual conflict
   can generate sexually antagonistic selection, which mediates sexual

   evolution of sexually antagonistic phenotypes based on quantitative
   genetics and the measure of social selection arising from male-female
   interactions. We consider the phenotype of one sex as both a genetically
   influenced evolving trait as well as the (evolving) social environment
   in which the phenotype of the opposite sex evolves. Several important
   points emerge from our analysis, including the relationship between
   direct selection on one sex and indirect effects through selection on
   the opposite sex. We suggest that the proposed approach may be a
   valuable tool to complement other theoretical approaches currently used
   to study sexual conflict. Most importantly, our approach highlights
   areas where additional empirical data can help clarify the role of
   sexual conflict in the evolutionary process.}},

Abstract = {{During sexual encounters, individuals often use signals, such as display
   traits, to attract mates. if individuals alter their display traits with
   respect to the genotype of potential mates, indirect genetic effects
   (IGEs) may occur in which the genes of one individual influence the
   phenotype of another. Although IGEs between related individuals have
   received much attention, their occurrence between unrelated individuals
   during sexual encounters has not. Here, we demonstrate that in the
   Australian fruit fly Drosophila serrata, males assess females by using
   both visual and olfactory cues, resulting in a rapid plastic response
   (within minutes) in male cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), a display trait
   that is an important target of mate choice. Several CHCs in males
   exhibited significant IGEs, and IGEs were inducible on both males reared
   in the laboratory and on field-caught individuals. A vector describing
   genetic variance in multiple CHCs in females was found to be almost
   identical to a vector describing indirect genetic variance in male CHCs,
   suggesting that males might assess female CHCs during courtship. This
   vector displayed contributions from all female CHCs in the same
   direction and of similar magnitude, suggesting that female condition may
   be the underlying casual trait that males are assessing. Consistent with
   this interpretation, when measured directly in a separate experiment,
   genetic variance in female condition accounted for 19.8\% of the
   indirect genetic variance in male CHCs. These indirect genetic effects
   have the potential to alter the response to selection of male sexual
   display traits.}},

Abstract = {{Germination responses to seasonal conditions determine the environment
   experienced by postgermination life stages, and this ability has
   potential consequences for the evolution of plant life histories. Using
   recombinant inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana, we tested whether
   life-history characters exhibited plasticity to germination timing,
   whether germination timing influenced the strength and mode of natural
   selection on life-history traits, and whether germination timing
   influenced the expression of genetic variation for life-history traits.
   Adult life-history traits exhibited strong plasticity to season of
   germination, and season of germination significantly altered the
   strength, mode, and even direction of selection on life-history traits
   under some conditions. None of the average plastic responses to season
   of germination or season of dispersal were adaptive, although some
   genotypes within our sample did exhibit adaptive responses. Thus,
   recombination between inbred lineages created some novel adaptive
   genotypes with improved responses to the seasonal timing of germination
   under some, but not all, conditions. Genetically based variation in
   germination time tended to augment genetic variances of adult
   life-history traits, but it did not increase the heritabilities because
   it also increased environmentally induced variance. Under some
   conditions, plasticity of life-history traits in response to genetically
   variable germination timing actually obscured genetic variation for
   those traits. Therefore, the evolution of germination responses can
   influence the evolution of life histories in a general manner by
   altering natural selection on life-history traits and the genetic
   variation of these traits.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to estimate genetic variation in aggressive
   behaviour of sows at mixing, and in maternal ability for the same sows.
   The study included 835 sows observed for number of mild or severe
   aggressions performed (F\_A1, F\_A2), or received (F\_R1, F\_R2) during
   30 min after grouping. Maternal ability was recorded as sows' response
   to vocalisation from their piglets when these were handled. Maternal
   behaviour was studied in 1076 sows as a body reaction (MBR) to their
   piglets being handled after farrowing. Genetic covariances were
   estimated using a multi-trait animal model, assuming traits to be
   normally distributed. The heritabilities of performed aggression traits
   were intermediate (h(2) F\_A1=0.17, h(2) F\_A2=0.24), but lower for
   received aggression (h(2) F\_R1=0.06, h(2) F\_R2=0.04), and heritability
   of maternal behaviour was also low (h(2)=0.08). Although estimates of
   genetic correlations had large standard errors, they indicate that less
   aggressive sows were stronger responding mothers (r(g)=-0.3). We
   conclude that performed aggression in sows is a heritable trait, and
   selection against aggression is possible without offsetting maternal
   behaviour. \&COPY; 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Question: How can we measure the effects of exogenous environment in the
   parental generation on heritable changes in subsequent generations?
   Mathematical method: Parent-offspring regression models can be used to
   estimate additive genetic effects that are caused by environmentally
   alterable signals.
   Key assumption: To be relevant. environmentally alterable additive
   effects (e.g. environmentally induced epigenetic changes in cytosine
   methylation or chromatin formation) must be non-negligible compared with
   direct additive genetic effects.
   Predictions: Large environmentally alterable additive genetic variance
   confounds prediction of evolutionary trajectories, but (1) provides a
   mechanism by which environmental variance directly increases additive
   genetic variance, (2) implies that environmental variance can cause
   evolutionary novelty, (3) provides one of possibly many mechanisms
   underlying phenotypic plasticity. and (4) may provide an explanation for
   why plants are more phenotypically plastic than animals.
   Conclusion: Environmentally alterable additive genetic effects place
   molecular epigenetic effects and soft inheritance within a modern

Abstract = {{When ontogeny takes place in a family, and parents provide essential
   resources for development, the parents become an environmental component
   to the development of a wide range of offspring traits. Because
   differences among parents may partly reflect genetic variation, this
   environmental component contains genes and may itself evolve. Also, when
   offspring play an active role in family interactions, offspring become a
   social environmental component to parents, affecting their behavior in
   turn, which potentially results in reciprocal social selection. Thus, an
   evolutionary process of coadaptation to family life, additionally driven
   by conflicts of interests, may have shaped the expression and
   development patterns underlying infant behaviors. The complex genetics
   arising from family interactions can be formalized by extending standard
   quantitative genetic models. These models demonstrate how the explicit
   consideration of the family environment can profoundly alter both the
   expression and evolutionary response to selection of behaviors involved
   in family interactions. Behavioral genetic studies have begun to unravel
   the complex genetics underlying infant solicitation behaviors and
   parental provisioning, although many focus on one side of the
   interaction. A genetic analysis incorporating interactions among family
   members explicitly may be critical because the genes underlying the
   expression of parental provisioning indirectly affect offspring
   behaviors, and vice versa.}},

Abstract = {{Very few studies have examined parent-offspring interactions from a
   quantitative genetic perspective. We used a cross-fostering design and
   measured genetic correlations and components of social selection arising
   from two parental and two offspring behaviors in the burying beetle
   Nicrophorus vespilloides. Genetic correlations were assessed by
   examining behavior of relatives independent of common social influences.
   We found positive genetic correlations between all pairs of behaviors,
   including between parent and offspring behaviors. Patterns of selection
   were assessed by standardized performance and selection gradients.
   Parental provisioning had positive effects on offspring performance and
   fitness, while remaining near the larvae without feeding them had
   negative effects. Begging had positive effects on offspring performance
   and fitness, while increased competition among siblings had negative
   effects. Coadaptations between parenting and offspring behavior appear
   to be maintained by genetic correlations and functional trade-offs;
   parents that feed their offspring more also spend more time in the area
   where they can forage for themselves. Families with high levels of
   begging have high levels of sibling competition. Integrating information
   from genetics and selection thus provides a general explanation for why
   variation persists in seemingly beneficial traits expressed in
   parent-offspring interactions and illustrates why it is important to
   measure functionally related suites of behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{In families in which both parents care for multiple offspring, the
   amount of care a parent provides can be simultaneously influenced by
   multiple social interactions (i.e., parent-parent and parent-offspring).
   In this study, we first tested for sex differences in the parents'
   contribution to care and then used path analysis to address the
   simultaneous impact of parent-parent and parent-offspring interactions
   on male and female care in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides.
   In this species, both parents provision their offspring predigested
   carrion from a vertebrate carcass, and the larvae beg for food from
   their parents. We found that females were more involved in direct care
   for the larvae and spent more time than did males provisioning the
   larvae with food. By using path analysis, we found a negative
   relationship between male and female provisioning, suggesting that
   parents adjust their behavior to that of their mate. Furthermore, we
   found that both social interactions (i.e., larval begging) and nonsocial
   factors (i.e., brood size) significantly influenced male provisioning,
   but had no significant effect on female provisioning. We suggest that
   the difference in the relative contribution of the two sexes to the care
   of the offspring explains why only males seemed to adjust their care to
   variation in social and nonsocial factors. For example, females may be
   less able to adjust their care to variation in larval begging and brood
   size because they were already working near their maximum capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Social dominance influences the outcome of competitive interactions over
   limited resources, and may hence be important for individual fitness.
   Theory thus predicts that its heritability will be low and that
   non-genetic determinants of dominance should prevail. In this field
   experiment we reciprocally cross-fostered great tits (Parus major) to
   blue tits (Parus caeruleus) to investigate the impact of early social
   experience on dominance status in competition over food during winter.
   Controlling for potential effects of age, size, sex and site-related
   dominance, we show that cross-fostered birds of both species were
   subdominant to conspecific immigrants, while controls originating from
   unmanipulated broods were dominant to conspecific immigrants.
   Furthermore, blue tits reared by blue tit parents but with at least one
   great tit broodmate had lower dominance status relative to conspecific
   immigrants than did controls. Although great tits generally dominated
   blue tits, cross-fostered birds of both species initiated marginally
   more fights against the other species than did their respective
   controls, suggesting faulty species recognition. Since both social
   parents and broodmates strongly influence the dominance behavior of
   offspring later in life, we conclude that social conditions experienced
   at an early age are crucial for the determination of subsequent social
   dominance.}},

   These maternal effects are predicted to result in unusual evolutionary

   (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) to documented episodes of natural selection
   and found support for both of the fundamental predictions of models that
   describe maternal effect evolution. First, changes in juvenile growth
   rates across one generation of selection were five times greater than
   predicted by heritability (h(2)) alone, but were consistent with the
   additional contribution of maternal genetic effects. Second, responses
   to selection were influenced not only by the strength of selection in
   the current generation, but also by selection in the previous
   generation, indicating the presence of evolutionary momentum. These
   results were in agreement with predictions of a simple model including
   litter size as the only maternal effect, and provide, to our knowledge,
   the first empirical evidence for the importance of maternal effects to

Abstract = {{Animals with determinate growth have shown little variation in

   genetic variation reflects phenotypic variation, not much evolutionary
   change can be expected. Our results show that there are ecological
   conditions that determine the strong covariation of size across ages,
   most likely size-related dominance behaviour, which can mask the true

Abstract = {{The ability of plants to sense their environment gives them the capacity
   to respond to it plastically. Plastic responses, in turn, frequently
   alter the environment that plants experience. Plants can modify the
   environment they experience through many mechanisms-some approximate but
   others quite precise. The ability of plants to modify the environment
   they experience can strongly influence the evolution of characters
   expressed subsequently. A review of some theoretical models of habitat
   selection and of the coevolution of characters and their environments
   highlights the importance of habitat selection in plants. Novel
   evolutionary trajectories and outcomes result when organisms are capable
   of modifying the environment they experience. Specifically, characters
   can evolve even if they have no genetic variation, and plasticity in
   environment-determining characters may promote specialization in others.
   Divergence and reproductive isolation may even be augmented by
   habitat-selecting behavior in plants. An understanding of basic
   character evolution and the evolution of plasticity in plants requires
   an appreciation of the ability of plants to modify the environment they
   experience.}},

   environmental, they differ from other sorts of environmental influences,
   because they can have a genetic basis and thus can contribute to
   evolution. Theory has shown that these effects modify the definition of
   genetic architecture by making the phenotype the property of the
   genotypes of multiple individuals and alter evolutionary dynamics by
   introducing additional heritable components contributing to trait
   evolution. These effects suggest that genetic and evolutionary analyses
   of traits influenced by social environments must incorporate the genetic
   components of variation contributed by these environments. However,
   empirical studies incorporating these effects are generally lacking. In
   this paper, I quantify the contribution of genetically based
   environmental effects arising from social interactions during group
   rearing to the quantitative genetics of body size in Drosophila
   melanogaster. The results demonstrate that the genetic architecture of
   body size contains an important component of variation contributed by
   the social environment, which is hidden to ordinary genetic analyses and
   opposes the direct effects of genes on body-size development within a
   population. Using a model of trait evolution, I show that these effects
   significantly alter evolutionary predictions by providing hidden
   constraints on phenotypic evolution. The importance of relatedness of
   interactants and the potential impact of kin selection on the evolution
   of body size are also examined.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We present evidence that the heritable genetic variation within
   individual species, especially dominant and keystone species, has
   community and ecosystem consequences. These consequences represent
   extended phenotypes, i.e., the effects of genes at levels higher than
   the population. Using diverse examples from microbes to vertebrates, we
   demonstrate that the extended phenotype can be traced from the
   individuals possessing the trait, to the community, and to ecosystem
   processes such as leaf litter decomposition and N mineralization. In our
   development of a community genetics perspective, we focus on
   intraspecific genetic variation because the extended phenotypes of these
   genes can be passed from one generation to the next, which provides a
   mechanism for heritability. In support of this view, common-garden
   experiments using synthetic crosses of a dominant tree show that their
   progeny tend to support arthropod communities that resemble those of
   their parents. We also argue that the combined interactions of extended
   phenotypes contribute to the among-community variance in the traits of
   individuals within communities. The genetic factors underlying this
   among-community variance in trait expression, particularly those
   involving genetic interactions among species, constitute community
   heritability. These findings have diverse implications. (1) They provide
   a genetic framework for understanding community structure and ecosystem
   processes. The effects of extended phenotypes at these higher levels
   need not be diffuse; they may be direct or may act in relatively few
   steps, which enhances our ability to detect and predict their effects.
   (2) From a conservation perspective, we introduce the concept of the
   minimum viable interacting population (MVIP), which represents the size
   of a population needed to maintain genetic diversity at levels required
   by other interacting species in the community. (3) Genotype X
   environment interactions in dominant and keystone species can shift
   extended phenotypes to have unexpected consequences at community and
   ecosystem levels, an issue that is especially important as it relates to
   global change. (4) Documenting community heritability justifies a
   community genetics perspective and is an essential first step in
   demonstrating community evolution. (5) Community genetics requires and
   promotes an integrative approach, from genes to ecosystems, that is
   necessary for the marriage of ecology and genetics. Few studies span
   from genes to ecosystems, but such integration is probably essential for
   understanding the natural world.}},

Abstract = {{One specialized environment that can influence development arises in the
   context of social interactions, including the environment contributed by
   a sexual partner during sexual reproduction. It is often difficult,
   however, to separate out the effect of mating (fertilization) from the
   effect of social environment. In the study reported here we examine the
   effect of social environment mediated by a pheromonal signal on the
   fertility and fecundity of the facultatively parthenogenetic cockroach
   Nauphoeta cinerea. By examining parthenogenetically reproducing females,
   we isolate the effects of social environment in the absence of mating or
   fertilization. Females exposed to male odors are more likely to produce
   parthenogenetic offspring. Further, increased exposure to the male
   pheromone increases the number of offspring produced. Variation in
   timing of reproduction is also dependent on the male. Thus, social
   environments are a mechanism by which males contribute to the
   development of their offspring, resulting in variation in development.
   This study illustrates the potential evolutionary importance of social
   environments in development, because a requirement for male-contributed
   environments may be a constraint to evolving asexual reproduction from a
   sexually reproducing species.}},

Abstract = {{Many characteristics of organisms in free-living populations appear to
   be under directional selection, possess additive genetic variance, and
   yet show no evolutionary response to selection. Avian breeding time and
   clutch size are often-cited examples of such characters. We report
   analyses of inheritance of, and selection on, these traits in a
   long-term study of a wild population of the collared flycatcher Ficedula
   albicollis. We used mixed model analysis with REML estimation
   ({''}animal models{''}) to make full use of the information in complex
   multigenerational pedigrees. Heritability of laying date, but not clutch
   size, was lower than that estimated previously using parent-offspring
   regressions, although for both traits there was evidence of substantial
   additive genetic variance (h(2) = 0.19 and 0.29, respectively). Laying
   date and clutch size were negatively genetically correlated (r(A) =
   -0.41 +/- 0.09), implying that selection on one of the traits would
   cause a correlated response in the other, but there was little evidence
   to suggest that evolution of either trait would be constrained by
   correlations with other phenotypic characters. Analysis of selection on
   these traits in females revealed consistent strong directional fecundity
   selection for earlier breeding at the level of the phenotype (beta =
   -0.28 +/- 0.03), but little evidence for stabilising selection on
   breeding time. We found no evidence that clutch size was independently
   under selection. Analysis of fecundity selection on breeding values for
   laying date, estimated from an animal model, indicated that selection
   acts directly on additive genetic variance underlying breeding time
   (beta = -0.20 +/- 0.04), but not on clutch size (beta = 0.03 +/- 0.05).
   In contrast, selection on laying date via adult female survival
   fluctuated in sign between years, and was opposite in sign for selection
   on phenotypes (negative) and breeding values (positive). Our data thus
   suggest that any evolutionary response to selection on laying date is
   partially constrained by underlying life-history trade-offs, and
   illustrate the difficulties in using purely phenotypic measures and
   incomplete fitness estimates to assess evolution of life-history
   trade-offs. We discuss some of the difficulties associated with
   understanding the evolution of laying date and clutch size in natural
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid expansion of genomic and molecular genetic techniques in model
   organisms, and the application of these techniques to organisms that are
   less well studied genetically, make it possible to understand the
   genetic control of many behavioral phenotypes. However, many behavioral
   ecologists are uncertain about the value of including a genetic
   component in their studies. In this article, we review how genetic
   analyses of behavior are central to topics ranging from understanding
   past selection and predicting future evolution to explaining the neural
   and hormonal control of behavior. Furthermore, we review both new and
   old techniques for studying evolutionary behavior genetics and highlight
   how the choice of approach depends on both the question and the
   organism. Topics discussed include genetic architecture, detecting the
   past history of selection, and genotype-by-environment interactions. We
   show how these questions are being addressed with techniques including
   statistical genetics, QTL analyses, transgenic analyses, and
   microarrays. Many of the techniques were first applied to the behavior
   of genetic model organisms such as laboratory mice and flies. Two recent
   developments serve to expand the relevance of such studies to behavioral
   ecology. The first is to use model organisms for studies of the genetic
   basis of evolutionarily relevant behavior and the second is to apply
   methods developed in model genetic systems to species that have not
   previously been examined genetically. These conceptual advances, along
   with the rapid diversification of genetic tools and the recognition of
   widespread genetic homology, suggest a bright outlook for evolutionary
   genetic studies. This review provides access to tools through references
   to the recent literature and shows the great promise for evolutionary
   behavioral genetics.}},

Abstract = {{Heritabilities, commonly used to predict evolutionary-potential, are
   notoriously low for behaviors. Apart from strong contributions of
   environmental variance in reducing heritabilities, the additive genetic
   components can be very low, especially when they are camouflaged by
   nonadditive genetic effects. We first report the heritabilities of
   courtship traits in founder-flush and control populations of the
   housefly (Musca domestica L.). We estimated the heritability of each
   male and female display through the regression of the courtships
   involving daughters and sons (with randomly selected mates) onto the
   ``midparental{''} courtship values of their parents. Overall, the
   average heritability was significantly (P=.012) higher for the
   parent-daughter assays than for the parent-son assays. We attributed the
   low (even negative) heritabilities to genotype-by-environment
   interactions whereby the male's behavior is influenced by the
   ``environment{''} of his mating partner's preferences for the display,
   generating epistasis through indirect genetic effects. Moreover,
   bottlenecked lines had up to 800\% of the heritability of the controls,
   suggesting ``conversion{''} of additive genetic variance from
   nonadditive components. Second, we used line-cross assays on separate
   populations that had been selected for divergence in mating behavior to
   identify dominance and epistasis through heterosis and outbreeding
   depression in courtship. Finally, our literature review confirms the
   prevalence of such low heritabilities (i.e., a conservative mean of
   0.38) and nonadditive genetics in other behavioral repertoires (64\% of
   the studies). We conclude that animal behavior is especially prone to
   the gamut of quantitative genetic complexities that can result in
   negative heritabilities, negative selection responses, inbreeding
   depression, conversion, heterosis, and outbreeding depression.}},

Abstract = {{Although the argument over genetic influences on social dominance is
   contentious, genetic models of interacting phenotypes provide a
   theoretical framework for heritable effects on, and therefore evolution
   of, social behavior. Here we adapt the interacting phenotype model to
   show how social dominance can evolve. Our model makes a number of
   predictions: rapid evolution of behavior, strong correlated responses in
   associated traits (such as a badge of status), and, because context is
   important for social dominance, integrated evolution of both dominant
   and subordinate behavior reflecting direct and indirect genetic effects
   and social selection. We also describe the results of empirical work,
   artificial selection based on social status within a hierarchy in the
   cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea, that we used to test the predictions of our
   model. There was little change within selection lines in the expression
   of agonistic behavior, but by just generation 7 of selection, in
   comparisons between lines, high-line males consistently dominated low
   and control males, while low-line males were consistently subordinate to
   high-line and control males. There was a strong correlated response to
   selection in the pheromonal badge of status. Some correlated responses
   to selection differed among replicate lines, with the compound that
   makes males subordinate changed in one replicate, while the compound
   that confers dominance was altered in the other. Overall, our results
   are consistent with predictions from models of interacting phenotypes:
   social dominance is influenced by additive genetic variation, can evolve
   as a result of social selection, and evolution of social interactions
   appears to be rapid. Finally, different responses in the replicates
   allowed us to test very specific predictions regarding the role of the
   social pheromone in N. cinerea, highlighting the value of artificial
   selection experiments as a tool in evolutionary behavioral genetic
   studies.}},

   courtship). Videotaped matings of the crosses between divergent lines
   (i.e. males of one strain mating with females from a different line)
   showed that the selection responses in the intensities of male
   performances were due to shifts in female preferences. In particular,
   the males were able to accommodate the demands of `foreign' females (as
   well as their own) in the no-choice situation (i.e. only one male and
   one female per mating chamber). In contrast to this plasticity of the
   males, the females were consistent in their differential resistance
   responses, regardless of the type of male involved in the courtship.
   Multiple-choice mate choice tests revealed significant reproductive
   isolation among some lines, although the effect was asymmetrical. The
   patterns of nonrandom mating were largely due to females from more
   genetically healthy lines (i.e. with overall high mating propensity)
   discriminating against males from populations with more inbreeding
   depression. We suggest that the inability to achieve true (symmetrical)
   reproductive isolation could have been due to low evolutionary potential
   in the `shape' of courtship, as defined by the second principal
   component. (C) 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGE) of parental care performance and the
   direct-indirect covariance contribute substantially to total
   heritability in domesticated and laboratory mammals. For animals from
   natural populations empirical estimates of IGE are sparse. Thus, despite
   recent models relating IGE to evolution, evolutionary interpretations of
   IGE are limited. To address this deficit, we used a reciprocal
   cross-fostering breeding design to estimate environmental influences,
   direct and indirect genetic effects, and direct-indirect genetic
   covariances in the burying beetle Nicrophorus pustulatus to determine
   the evolutionary importance of IGE arising from variation in parental
   care performance. Carrion size positively affected adult mass and time
   on carrion, but had no effect on total development time. Males were
   slightly larger than females. For both mass and development, independent
   of these environmental influences, direct and indirect genetic effects
   were of moderate magnitude. Total genetic effects explained 36-50\% of
   the phenotypic variance in mass and size and 27-37\% of phenotypic
   variance in development time. Direct-indirect genetic covariances were
   zero or close to zero. Thus, for both mass and development time, the
   response to natural selection arising from environmental variation may
   be accelerated by the presence of IGE in N. pustulatus . The generality
   of this pattern and the evolutionary significance of IGE arising from
   parental care awaits further study of natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of chemical communication in moths has implications for
   speciation because mate attraction and reproductive isolation are
   achieved primarily by unique blends of female-produced sex pheromones
   and the specificity of male responses to these signals. For most
   organisms, the genetics of speciation remains an open empirical
   question, but both major gene effects and additive genetic variation are
   likely to play roles in the diversification of chemical communication
   that accompanies speciation. In the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni
   (Hubner), a single gene mutation results in females that produce a
   drastically different signal. We conducted four wind-tunnel experiments
   to examine the potential role of additive genetic variation in the
   evolution of male T. ni response to this novel pheromone blend. The
   heritability of male response to both normal and mutant pheromone
   signals was tested in two experiments using a father-son regression
   design. Normal male response to the mutant blend showed a heritability
   of 0.25. The heritability of normal male response to the normal blend
   and the mutant male responses to both normal and mutant blends were at
   or near 0. In a third experiment, we imposed selection on normal male
   lines for increased response to the mutant pheromone blend. After three
   generations of selection, normal male response had increased by 24\% as
   compared to only 5\% in control lines, confirming the heritability value
   determined earlier. A fourth experiment showed that the change in the
   selected lines was due to an improved male response to both the normal

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when the phenotype of an
   individual, and possibly its fitness, depends, at least in part, on the
   genes of its social partners. The effective result is that environmental
   sources of phenotypic variance can themselves evolve. Simple models have
   shown that IGEs can alter the rate and direction of evolution for traits
   involved in interactions. Here we expand the applicability of the theory
   of IGEs to evolution in metapopulations by including nonlinear
   interactions between individuals and population genetic structure.
   Although population subdivision alone generates some dramatic and
   nonintuitive evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes, the
   combination of nonlinear interactions with subdivision reveals an even
   greater importance of IGEs. The presence of genetic structure links the
   evolution of interacting phenotypes and the traits that influence their
   expression ({''}effector traits{''}) even in the absence of genetic
   correlations. When nonlinear social effects occur in subdivided
   populations, evolutionary response is altered and can even oppose the
   direction expected due to direct selection. Because population genetic
   structure allows for multilevel selection, we also investigate the role
   of IGEs in determining the response to individual and group selection.
   We find that nonlinear social effects can cause interference between
   levels of selection even when they act in the same direction. In some
   cases, interference can be so extreme that the actual evolutionary
   response to multilevel selection is opposite in direction to that
   predicted by summing selection at each level. This theoretical result
   confirms empirical data that show higher levels of selection cannot be
   ignored even when selection acts in the same direction at all levels.}},

Abstract = {{The selection of alternative reproductive phenotypes is often thought to
   be the result of physiological state, with small individuals forced
   energetically to postpone the allocation of resources to reproduction.
   However, for male fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas), we show that
   seasonal reproductive activity is modulated by social status. In
   enclosure and pond experiments, small males advanced their reproductive
   condition, held nesting territories, and spawned earlier in the
   reproductive season only when lat ge males were absent or removed from
   the population. Since differences in the timing of reproduction among
   small males were not size- or condition-dependent, the common
   explanation for the selection of alternative reproductive phenotypes,
   based on state-dependence, is insufficient. In the absence of large,
   socially dominant individuals, small males produced comparable numbers
   of offspring as the treatment with large males, although the offspring
   of these uninhibited small males were smaller at the end of the growing
   season than the young of large males. Thus, interactions among
   conspecifics may account for much of the phenotypic diversity observed
   within and among natural fathead minnow populations, through their
   direct and indirect effects our growth, recruitment and survival.}},

Abstract = {{Chromosomal races of the house mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) in
   Valtellina and Orobian Alps (Northern Italy) are known for their very
   fast raciation. Here we present a study using geometric morphometrics on
   size and shape changes in the skull and the mandible of three races
   (Orobian, Upper Valtellina, Poschiavo) occurring in this area and
   forming a presumably monophyletic group. One of the races (Upper
   Valtellina) went extinct recently in an area of sympatry with the
   Poschiavo race, so that data on genetics (chromosomes and allozymes),
   behaviour and morphology were available to investigate causes of
   phenotypic divergence during speciation with a recent extinction event.
   The evaluation of partial warp scores and the uniform component shows
   that morphological changes have been fast and that these races can be
   recognized on the basis of skull shape. Patterns of evolution in shape
   changes were visualized by combining the chromosomal phylogeny and shape
   space, summarizing therefore both the phenetic and cladistic
   relationships. Shape changes follow the cladogenetic sequence depicted
   by chromosomal fusions. The examination of Procrustes distances shows
   that the different parts of the skull evolved at different rates after
   speciation, with shifts in the integration of the various structures
   (olfactory, auditory, feeding, visualization, etc.). Among the possible
   causes, aggressive behaviour was advocated for sudden changes in the
   shape of the skull. (C) 2001 The Linnean Society of London.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms frequently choose, regulate, construct and destroy important
   components of their environments, in the process changing the selection
   pressures to which they and other organisms are exposed. We refer to
   these processes as niche construction. In humans, culture has greatly
   amplified our capacity for niche construction and our ability to modify
   selection pressures. We use gene-culture coevolutionary models to
   explore the evolutionary consequences of culturally generated niche
   construction through human evolution. Our analysis suggests that where
   cultural traits are transmitted in an unbiased fashion from parent to
   offspring, cultural niche construction will have a similar effect to
   gene-based niche construction. However, cultural transmission biases
   favouring particular cultural traits may either increase or reduce the
   range of parameter space over which niche construction has an impact,
   which means that niche construction with biased transmission will either
   have a much smaller or a much bigger effect than gene-based niche
   construction. The analysis also reveals circumstances under which
   cultural transmission can overwhelm natural selection, accelerate the
   rate at which a favoured gene spreads, initiate novel evolutionary
   events and trigger hominid speciation. Because cultural processes
   typically operate faster than natural selection, cultural niche
   construction probably has more profound consequences than gene-based
   niche construction, and is likely to have played an important role in
   human evolution.}},

   offspring phenotype is through the level of care they provide. In
   onthophagine dung beetles, parents typically provision their offspring
   by packing dung fragments into a brood mass. Onthophagus taurus males
   can be separated into two discrete morphs: Large, ``major{''} males have
   head horns, whereas ``minor{''} males are hornless. Here we show that a
   switch in parental provisioning strategies adopted by males coincides
   with the switch in male morphology. Male provisioning results in the
   production of heavier brood masses than females will produce alone.
   However, unlike females in which the level of provisioning increases
   with body size in a continuous manner, the level of provisioning
   provided by males represents an ``all-or-none{''} tactic with all major
   males providing a Bred level of provisioning irrespective of their body
   size. Offspring size is determined largely by the quantity of dung
   provided to the developing larvae so that paternal and maternal
   provisioning affects the body size and horn size of offspring produced.
   The levels of provisioning by individual parents are significantly
   repeatable, suggesting paternal and maternal effects as candidate
   indirect genetic effects in the evolution of horn size in the genus
   Onthophagus.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the relationship between social dominance, immune response,
   and ornamentation in captive red jungle fowl by comparing these
   variables in males housed individually with a single female to those in
   the same males after they were placed in flocks with an unfamiliar male
   and three unfamiliar females. Males with larger combs before being
   placed in the flocks were more likely to become dominant, and dominant
   males' combs grew after flock Formation, whereas subordinate males'
   combs shrank. Immune response as reflected in hematocrit, immunoglobulin
   levels, and wing web swelling (a measure of cell-mediated immunity) was
   stronger in males that later became dominant, both before and after
   flock formation, although the difference between dominant and
   subordinate birds was more pronounced after males were housed in the
   multi-male groups. Dominant and subordinate males also differed in the
   relationship between comb length and wing web swelling. Among dominant
   males, individuals with larger combs had significantly larger swellings
   after flock formation, whereas within the subordinate males, those with
   relatively larger combs had worse cell-mediated immunity than those with
   smaller combs. These results suggest that males of different quality pay
   different costs to maintain both ornamentation and immune defense.}},

Abstract = {{A biallelic viability model based on human data for maternal-fetal
   interactions reported by Hedrick (1997) gives the interesting result of
   neutral stability at all gene frequencies. I show that there are two
   levels of selection, within and among families, acting in opposing
   directions in this model and that the neutral stability occurs when the
   two levels of selection exactly balance one another, as they do in a
   randomly mating population. Deviations from random mating disrupt the
   balance and consequently destroy the neutral stability. However, with
   inbreeding avoidance, which characterizes the human histocompatibility
   loci, within-family selection is strengthened and among-family selection
   is weakened. This favors the invasion of new alleles and contributes to
   a high equilibrium level of genetic diversity at loci with
   maternal-fetal interactions affecting offspring viability in the pattern
   described by Hedrick. This pattern of selection is remarkably similar to
   that observed for the maternal effect selfish genes, Medea in flour

Abstract = {{Maternal influences on progeny characters affect phenotypic correlations
   between characters expressed in maternal and progeny generations and
   consequently influence evolutionary responses to selection. Net
   selection on maternally influenced characters depends on selection birth
   on the progeny character and on the maternal characters that influence
   it. I used seed dispersal in Cakile edentula as a system in which to
   identify the mechanisms of environmentally mediated maternal effects and
   to determine how selection on maternal characters alters the adaptive
   value of dispersal. In C. edentula, maternal morphology responds to
   conspecific density experienced by the mother. Maternal morphology in
   turn affects offspring (seed) dispersal and density and thereby
   offspring morphology and fitness. I estimated the magnitude of
   density-mediated maternal effects on dispersal and identified their
   mechanism by characterizing the plasticity of maternal morphology to
   density. I also measured density-dependent selection on maternal
   characters that influence dispersal. Maternal plasticity to density was
   caused by both allometric and nonallometric variation in morphology, and
   this plasticity resulted in a negative correlation between maternal and
   progeny density. Such negative maternal effects are expected to retard
   responses to selection. Maternal morphology influenced maternal Fitness,
   in part through the relationship of fitness to maternal plant size and
   in part through size-independent fitness effects. Maternal phenotypes
   that promote dispersal, and thereby increase progeny fitness, were
   associated with decreased maternal fitness. Selection on dispersal at
   the level of progeny favors increased dispersal; maternal influences on
   dispersal, however, not only cause a greatly reduced adaptive value of
   dispersal but lead to the prediction of a slower response to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Cannibalism is widespread among many different organisms, and can have

   relatives can minimize negative fitness consequences of cannibalism Such
   avoidance requires kin discrimination; but evidence for this ability
   among cannibals is Limited with little data that address the cues used
   in such discrimination. We examined whether larvae of the ladybird
   beetle Harmonia axyridis avoid eating their relatives. We further
   manipulated environmental factors to.,create individuals that had
   similar or dissimilar rearing environments to begin to test for
   endogenous versus exogenous recognition cues. Zn our experiments,
   third-instar larvae were much less likely to cannibalize if they were
   interacting with a relative. Larvae; that did cannibalize kin required
   more:encounters, and significantly delayed cannibalism, compared to
   larvae cannibalizing unrelated individuals. Acquired cues were less
   important. Even though the different rearing environment resulted in:
   significantly different phenotypic effects, similarity or dissimilarity
   of, rearing environment had no effect on cannibalism, and there was no
   interaction between environments and relatedness in cannibalism. We
   suggest that H. axyridis has a well-developed kin discrimination system,

Volume = {{153}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions often affect the fitness of interactants. Because of
   this, social selection has been described as a process distinct from
   other forms of natural selection. Social selection has been predicted to
   result in different evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes,
   including rapid or extreme evolution and evolution of altruism. Despite
   the critical role that social selection plays in theories of social
   evolution, few studies have measured the force of social selection or
   the conditions under which this force changes. Here we present a model
   of social selection acting on interacting phenotypes that can be
   evaluated independently from the genetics of interacting phenotypes. Our
   model of social selection is analogous to covariance model of other
   forms of selection. We observe that an opportunity for social selection
   exists whenever individual fitness varies as a result of interactions
   with conspecifics. Social selection occurs, therefore, when variation in
   fitness due to interactions covaries with traits, resulting in a net
   force of selection acting on the interacting phenotypes. Thus, there
   must be a covariance between the phenotypes of the interactants for
   social selection to exist. This interacting phenotype covariance is
   important because it measures the degree to which a particular trait
   covaries with the selective environment provided by conspecifics. A
   variety of factors, including nonrandom interactions, behavioral
   modification during interactions, relatedness, and indirect genetic
   effects may contribute to the covariance of interacting phenotypes,
   which promotes social selection. The independent force of social
   selection (measured as a social selection gradient) can be partitioned
   empirically from the force of natural selection (measured by the natural
   selection gradient) using partial regression. This measure can be
   combined with genetic models of interacting phenotypes to provide
   insights into social evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Differences among individuals are necessary for natural selection to
   occur. The extent and expression of these differences can limit the
   power of selection to cause evolutionary change. When individuals
   inconsistently express a trait, selection is less powerful. Labile
   traits such as behaviour are most likely to be inconsistent in their
   expression, because of the substantial role of environmental factors in
   their immediate expression. Previous work has focused on the
   consistency, or repeatability, of individual behaviour across different
   environments or within a single environment; little is known about how
   repeatability within an environment changes across environments. To
   address this issue, we examined the consistency of antipredator
   behaviour in juvenile garter snakes in different thermal environments. A
   group of 59 laboratory-born garter snakes, Thamnophis ordinoides, was
   repeatedly assayed for sprint speed, distance crawled, and number of
   reversals performed during flight and antipredator display. Antipredator
   display showed very little variation and could not be analysed. Each
   individual was tested three times at each of three temperatures chosen
   to span the range of temperatures that snakes encounter in the field
   (15, 22.5, 30 degrees C). Temperature had substantial effects on the
   average expression of each behaviour;snakes crawled more slowly, for
   shorter distances, and performed fewer reversals at cooler temperatures.
   Individuals showed significant consistency in their behaviour, and this
   consistency of expression was not affected by temperature. (C) 1999 The

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are environmental influences on the
   phenotype of one individual that are due to the expression of genes in a
   different, conspecific, individual, Historically, work has focused on
   the influence of parents on offspring but recent advances have extended
   this perspective to interactions among other relatives and even
   unrelated individuals, IGEs lead to complicated pathways of inheritance,
   where environmental sources of variation can be transmitted across
   generations and therefore contribute to evolutionary change, The
   existence of IGEs alters the genotype-phenotype relationship, changing
   the evolutionary process in some dramatic and non-intuitive ways.}},

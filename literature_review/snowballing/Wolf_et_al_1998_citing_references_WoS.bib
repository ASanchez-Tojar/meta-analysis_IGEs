Title = {{Social runaway: Fisherian elaboration (or reduction) of socially
   selected traits via indirect genetic effects}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Abstract = {{Our understanding of the evolutionary stability of socially selected
   traits is dominated by sexual selection models originating with R. A.
   Fisher, in which genetic covariance arising through assortative mating
   can trigger exponential, runaway trait evolution. To examine whether
   nonreproductive, socially selected traits experience similar
   dynamics-social runaway-when assortative mating does not automatically
   generate a covariance, we modeled the evolution of socially selected
   badge and donation phenotypes incorporating indirect genetic effects
   (IGEs) arising from the social environment. We establish a social
   runaway criterion based on the interaction coefficient, psi, which
   describes social effects on badge and donation traits. Our models make
   several predictions. (1) IGEs can drive the original evolution of
   altruistic interactions that depend on receiver badges. (2) Donation
   traits are more likely to be susceptible to IGEs than badge traits. (3)
   Runaway dynamics in nonsexual, social contexts can occur in the absence
   of a genetic covariance. (4) Traits elaborated by social runaway are
   more likely to involve reciprocal, but nonsymmetrical, social
   plasticity. Models incorporating plasticity to the social environment
   via IGEs illustrate conditions favoring social runaway, describe a
   mechanism underlying the origins of costly traits, such as altruism, and
   support a fundamental role for phenotypic plasticity in rapid social
   evolution.}},

Title = {{No evidence for behavioural syndrome and genetic basis for three
   personality traits in a wild bird population}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{153}},
Pages = {{69-82}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Personality traits and their correlations have been shown to be linked
   with life history strategies and fitness in various species.
   Among-individual correlations (i.e. behavioural syndromes) between
   personality traits can affect the evolutionary responses of these traits
   to environmental variation. Understanding the genetic and ecological
   determinants of personality traits and their interactions as behavioural
   syndromes in the wild is thus needed to shed light on the mechanisms
   shaping their evolution. Partitioning the observed (co)variance in these
   traits, however, requires large numbers of repeated behavioural measures
   on many individuals of known relatedness level. In the absence of such
   data, it is thus often assumed that phenotypic (co)variances inform
   about (i) underlying among-individual (co)variances (i.e. ignoring
   within-individual (co)variances) and (2) underlying genetic (co)
   variances. We tested these assumptions using three personality traits
   collected during 3 years on a long-term monitored breeding population of
   collared flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis. We partitioned the observed
   phenotypic (co)variance of aggressiveness, boldness and neophobia into
   genetic, permanent environment and parental components, and we estimated
   the repeatability, and heritability of these traits and their
   among-individual correlations. All three traits were repeatable between
   years (at least on the latent scale) but none were heritable. Permanent
   environment effects explained 15\% of the phenotypic variance in
   aggressiveness, and parental effects explained 25\% of the phenotypic
   variance in neophobia, in line with previous studies in wild
   populations. The three traits showed phenotypic correlations but no
   among-individual correlations and no additive genetic covariance. Thus,
   our results did not support the assumptions that phenotypic covariance
   reflects behavioural syndromes and genetic covariance. We discuss the
   reasons for the absence of heritability and among-individual and genetic
   covariance between these three personality traits in light of the
   possible selective pressures acting on this population. (C) 2019

   Health, we find no credible evidence that an individual's BMI is
   affected by the polygenic risk score for BMI of their full sibling when

   we find no evidence that the positive correlations in BMI between

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{559-571}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Organisms can affect one another's phenotypes when they socially
   interact. Indirect genetic effects occur when an individual's phenotype
   is affected by genes expressed in another individual. These heritable
   effects can enhance or reduce adaptive potential, thereby accelerating
   or reversing evolutionary change. Quantifying these social effects is
   therefore crucial for our understanding of evolution, yet estimates of
   indirect genetic effects in wild animals are limited to dyadic
   interactions. We estimated indirect phenotypic and genetic effects, and
   their covariance with direct effects, for the date of spring breeding in
   North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) living in an
   array of territories of varying spatial proximity. Additionally, we
   estimated indirect effects and the strength of selection at low and high
   population densities. Social effects of neighbours on the date of spring
   breeding were different from zero at high population densities but not
   at low population densities. Indirect phenotypic effects accounted for a
   larger amount of variation in the date of breeding than differences
   attributable to the among-individual variance, suggesting social
   interactions are important for determining breeding dates. The genetic
   component to these indirect effects was however not statistically
   significant. We therefore showcase a powerful and flexible method that
   will allow researchers working in organisms with a range of social
   systems to estimate indirect phenotypic and genetic effects, and
   demonstrate the degree to which social interactions can influence
   phenotypes, even in a solitary species.}},

   interactome}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Development is often strongly regulated by interactions among close
   relatives, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown.
   In eusocial insects, interactions between caregiving worker nurses and
   larvae regulate larval development and resultant adult phenotypes. Here,
   we begin to characterize the social interactome regulating ant larval
   development by collecting and sequencing the transcriptomes of
   interacting nurses and larvae across time. We find that the majority of
   nurse and larval transcriptomes exhibit parallel expression dynamics
   across larval development. We leverage this widespread nurse-larva gene
   co-expression to infer putative social gene regulatory networks acting
   between nurses and larvae. Genes with the strongest inferred social
   effects tend to be peripheral elements of within-tissue regulatory
   networks and are often known to encode secreted proteins. This includes
   interesting candidates such as the nurse-expressed giant-lens, which may
   influence larval epidermal growth factor signaling, a pathway known to
   influence various aspects of insect development. Finally, we find that
   genes with the strongest signatures of social regulation tend to
   experience relaxed selective constraint and are evolutionarily young.
   Overall, our study provides a first glimpse into the molecular and
   evolutionary features of the social mechanisms that regulate all aspects
   of social life.
   Author summary Social interactions are fundamental to all forms of life,
   from single-celled bacteria to complex plants and animals. Despite their
   obvious importance, little is known about the molecular causes and
   consequences of social interactions. In this paper, we study the
   molecular basis of nurse-larva social interactions that regulate larval
   development in the pharaoh ant Monomorium pharaonis. We infer the
   effects of social interactions on gene expression from samples of nurses
   and larvae collected in the act of interaction across a developmental
   time series. Gene expression appears to be closely tied to these
   interactions, such that we can identify genes expressed in nurses with
   putative regulatory effects on larval gene expression. Genes which we
   infer to have strong social regulatory effects tend to have weak
   regulatory effects within individuals, and highly social genes tend to
   experience relatively weaker natural selection in comparison to fewer
   social genes. This study represents a novel approach and foundation upon
   which future studies at the intersection of genetics, behavior, and
   evolution can build.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{331-342}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental part of the quantitative genetic theory deals with the
   partitioning of the phenotypic variance into additive genetic and
   environmental components. During interaction with conspecifics, the
   interaction partner becomes a part of the environment from the
   perspective of the focal individual. If the interaction effects have a
   genetic basis, they are called indirect genetic effects (IGEs) and can
   evolve along with direct genetic effects. Sexual reproduction is a
   classic context where potential conflict between males and females can
   arise from trade-offs between current and future investments. We studied
   five female fecundity traits, egg length and number, egg pod length and
   number and latency to first egg pod, and estimated the direct and IGEs
   using a half-sib breeding design in the grasshopper Chorthippus
   biguttulus. We found that the male IGEs were an order of magnitude lower
   than the direct genetic effects and were not significantly different
   from zero. However, there was some indication that IGEs were larger
   shortly after mating, consistent with the idea that IGEs fade with time
   after interaction. Female direct heritabilities were moderate to low.
   Simulation shows that the variance component estimates can appear larger
   with less data, calling for care when interpreting variance components
   estimated with low power. Our results illustrate that the contribution
   of male IGEs is overall low on the phenotypic variance of female
   fecundity traits. Thus, even in the relevant context of sexual conflict,
   the influence of male IGEs on the evolutionary trajectory of female
   reproductive traits is likely to be small.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic architecture fundamentally affects the way that traits evolve.
   However, the mapping of genotype to phenotype includes complex
   interactions with the environment or even the sex of an organism that
   can modulate the expressed phenotype. Line-cross analysis is a powerful
   quantitative genetics method to infer genetic architecture by analysing
   the mean phenotype value of two diverged strains and a series of
   subsequent crosses and backcrosses. However, it has been difficult to
   account for complex interactions with the environment or sex within this
   framework. We have developed extensions to line-cross analysis that
   allow for gene by environment and gene by sex interactions. Using
   extensive simulation studies and reanalysis of empirical data, we show
   that our approach can account for both unintended environmental
   variation when crosses cannot be reared in a common garden and can be
   used to test for the presence of gene by environment or gene by sex
   interactions. In analyses that fail to account for environmental
   variation between crosses, we find that line-cross analysis has low
   power and high false-positive rates. However, we illustrate that
   accounting for environmental variation allows for the inference of
   adaptive divergence, and that accounting for sex differences in
   phenotypes allows practitioners to infer the genetic architecture of
   sexual dimorphism.}},

Abstract = {{Despite serving the primary objective of ensuring that at least one
   sperm cell reaches and fertilises an ovum, the male ejaculate (i.e.
   spermatozoa and seminal fluid) is a compositionally complex `trait' that
   can respond phenotypically to subtle changes in conditions. In
   particular, recent research has shown that environmentally and
   genetically induced changes to ejaculates can have implications for
   offspring traits that are independent of the DNA sequence encoded into
   the sperm's haploid genome. In this review, we compile evidence from
   several disciplines and numerous taxonomic systems to reveal the extent
   of such ejaculate-mediated paternal effects (EMPEs). We consider a
   number of environmental and genetic factors that have been shown to
   impact offspring phenotypes via ejaculates, and where possible, we
   highlight the putative mechanistic pathways by which ejaculates can act
   as conduits for paternal effects. We also highlight how females
   themselves can influence EMPEs, and in some cases, how maternally
   derived sources of variance may confound attempts to test for EMPEs.
   Finally, we consider a range of putative evolutionary implications of
   EMPEs and suggest a number of potentially useful approaches for
   exploring these further. Overall, our review confirms that EMPEs are
   both widespread and varied in their effects, although studies reporting
   their evolutionary effects are still in their infancy.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment is expected to have substantial effects on
   behavior, and as a consequence, its heritability and evolvability. We
   investigated these effects by exposing Australian field crickets
   (Teleogryllus oceanicus) to either silence or recordings of male
   acoustic sexual signals. We used a combined pedigree and
   full-sib/half-sib breeding design to estimate the repeatability,
   heritability, and evolvability of behaviors related to boldness,
   exploration, and activity. All behaviors measured were significantly
   repeatable in both social environments. Additionally, most behaviors
   showed significant heritabilities in the two environments. We found no
   difference in repeatabilities between the silent and the acoustic
   environment but did find significant differences in the heritabilities
   and evolvabilities between these environments. There was a high degree
   of similarity between the phenotypic covariance matrices across the two
   environments, while the genotypic covariance matrices were highly
   dissimilar. Reflecting this, we found significant
   genotype-by-environment interactions for most of the behaviors. Lastly,
   we found that the repeatable aspect of behavior ({''}personality{''})
   was significantly heritable for most behaviors, but that these
   heritabilities were higher in the acoustic than in the silent
   environment. We conclude that the social environment can have a
   significant impact on the heritability and evolvability of behavior, and
   argue that evolutionary inferences from phenotypic studies should be
   made with caution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a critical analysis of genetically informed research
   on relationships, with an emphasis on relationships among unrelated
   individuals (e.g., spouses). To date, research in this area has used
   traditional behavioral genetic frameworks to either partition the
   variance in relationship-related outcomes into genetic and environmental
   components, or to examine gene-environment interplay between
   relationship factors and other outcomes. However, this conventional
   approach is at odds with the long-standing understanding from the field
   of relationship science that both partners' characteristics matter when
   predicting shared outcomesthat is, outcomes that are emergent. We
   examine briefly the philosophical concept of emergence, and discuss ways
   to model dyadic outcomes in genetically informed relationships research.
   We also review the related topic of social genetic effects, which refer
   to the influence of a social partner's genotype on a proband's
   phenotype. A genetically informed dyadic perspective has potentially
   important consequences for our understanding of the pathways from
   genotypeshared or individual-level phenotypes, and more fully recognizes
   the complexity of how genetic and social/environmental factors come
   together to influence human behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In 2017, The American Naturalist celebrated its 150th anniversary. It

   theory was developed to explain the history of nature before humankind
   existed to alter it-when time was expansive and uncommon events, though
   rare, were frequent enough to effect evolutionary change. Today, with
   the influence of human activity, dispersal patterns are fundamentally
   altered, genetic variation is locally limiting in small and fragmented
   populations, and environments are changing so rapidly that time itself
   seems limited. How can we use this theory, which was built to explain
   the past and which depends on an excess of chances and time, to address
   the challenges of the present and the future when chances are fewer and
   time seems so short? And does the habit of naturalists to observe,

   evolutionary processes}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{104-115}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The infection of cells by multiple copies of a given virus can impact
   viral evolution in a variety of ways, yet some of the most basic
   evolutionary dynamics remain underexplored. Using computational models,
   we investigate how infection multiplicity affects the fixation
   probability of mutants, the rate of mutant generation, and the timing of
   mutant invasion. An important insight from these models is that for
   neutral and disadvantageous phenotypes, rare mutants initially enjoy a
   fitness advantage in the presence of multiple infection of cells. This
   arises because multiple infection allows the rare mutant to enter more
   target cells and to spread faster, while it does not accelerate the
   spread of the resident wild-type virus. The rare mutant population can
   increase by entry into both uninfected and wild-type-infected cells,
   while the established wild-type population can initially only grow
   through entry into uninfected cells. Following this initial advantageous
   phase, the dynamics are governed by drift or negative selection,
   respectively, and a higher multiplicity reduces the chances that mutants
   fix in the population. Hence, while increased infection multiplicity
   promotes the presence of neutral and disadvantageous mutants in the
   short-term, it makes it less likely in the longer term. We show how
   these theoretical insights can be useful for the interpretation of
   experimental data on virus evolution at low and high multiplicities. The
   dynamics explored here provide a basis for the investigation of more
   complex viral evolutionary processes, including recombination,
   reassortment, as well as complementary/inhibitory interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs; the heritable influence of one organism
   on a conspecific) can affect the evolutionary dynamics of complex
   traits, including behavior. Voluntary wheel running is an important
   model system in quantitative genetic studies of behavior, but the
   possibility of IGEs on wheel running and its components (time spent
   running and average running speed) has not been examined. Here, we
   analyze a dataset from a replicated selection experiment on wheel
   running (11,420 control and 26,575 selected mice measured over 78
   generations) in which the standard measurement protocol allowed for the
   possibility of IGEs occurring through odors because mice were provided
   with clean cages attached to a clean wheel or a wheel previously
   occupied by another mouse for 6days. Overall, mice ran less on
   previously occupied wheels than on clean wheels, and they ran
   significantly less when following a male than a female. Significant
   interactions indicated that the reduction in running was more pronounced
   for females than males and for mice from selected lines than control
   mice. Pedigree-based animal model analyses revealed significant IGEs for
   running distance (the trait under selection), with effect sizes
   considerably higher for the initial/exploratory phase (i.e., first two
   of six test days). Our results demonstrate that IGEs can occur in mice
   interacting through scent only, possibly because they attempt to avoid
   conspecifics.}},

Abstract = {{Both reciprocity and positive assortment (like with like) are predicted
   to promote the evolution of cooperation, yet how partners influence each
   other's behaviour within dynamic networks is not well understood. One
   way to test this question is to partition phenotypic variation into
   differences among individuals in the expression of cooperative behaviour
   (the `direct effect'), and plasticity within individuals in response to
   the social environment (the `indirect effect'). A positive correlation
   between these two sources of variation, such that more cooperative
   individuals elicit others to cooperate, is predicted to facilitate
   social contagion and selection on cooperative behaviour. Testing this
   hypothesis is challenging, however, because it requires repeated
   measures of behaviour across a dynamic social landscape. Here, we use an
   automated data-logging system to quantify the behaviour of 179
   wire-tailed manakins, birds that form cooperative male-male coalitions,
   and we use multiple-membership models to test the hypothesis that
   dynamic network partnerships shape within-individual variation in
   cooperative behaviour. Our results show strong positive correlations
   between a bird's own sociality and his estimated effect on his partners,
   consistent with the hypothesis that cooperation begets cooperation.
   These findings support the hypothesis that social contagion can
   facilitate selection for cooperative behaviour within social networks.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental tenet of maternal effects assumes that maternal variance
   over time should have discordant consequences for offspring traits
   across litters. Yet, seldom are parents observed across multiple
   reproductive bouts, with few studies considering anthropogenic
   disturbances as an ecological driver of maternal effects. We observed
   captive coyote (Canis latrans) pairs over two successive litters to
   determine whether among-litter differences in behavior (i.e.,
   risk-taking) and hormones (i.e., cortisol and testosterone) corresponded
   with parental plasticity in habituation. Thus, we explicitly test the
   hypothesis that accumulating experiences of anthropogenic disturbance
   reduces parental fear across reproductive bouts, which should have
   disparate phenotypic consequences for first- and second-litter
   offspring. To quantify risk-taking behavior, we used foraging assays
   from 5-15 weeks of age with a human observer present as a proxy for
   human disturbance. At 5, 10, and 15 weeks of age, we collected shaved
   hair to quantify pup hormone levels. We then used a quantitative genetic
   approach to estimate heritability, repeatability, and between-trait
   correlations. We found that parents were riskier (i.e., foraged more
   frequently) with their second versus first litters, supporting our
   prediction that parents become increasingly habituated over time.
   Second-litter pups were also less risk-averse than their first-litter
   siblings. Heritability for all traits did not differ from zero
   (0.001-0.018); however, we found moderate support for repeatability in
   all observed traits (r = 0.085-0.421). Lastly, we found evidence of
   positive phenotypic and cohort correlations among pup traits, implying
   that cohort identity (i.e., common environment) contributes to the
   development of phenotypic syndromes in coyote pups. Our results suggest
   that parental habituation may be an ecological cue for offspring to
   reduce their fear response, thus emphasizing the role of parental
   plasticity in shaping their pups' behavioral and hormonal responses
   toward humans.}},

Title = {{Modelling the co-evolution of indirect genetic effects and inherited

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{631-647}},

Abstract = {{When individuals interact, their phenotypes may be affected not only by
   their own genes but also by genes in their social partners. This
   phenomenon is known as Indirect Genetic Effects (IGEs). In aquaculture
   species and some plants, however, competition not only affects trait
   levels of individuals, but also inflates variability of trait values
   among individuals. In the field of quantitative genetics, the
   variability of trait values has been studied as a quantitative trait in
   itself, and is often referred to as inherited variability. Such studies,
   however, consider only the genetic effect of the focal individual on
   trait variability and do not make a connection to competition. Although
   the observed phenotypic relationship between competition and variability
   suggests an underlying genetic relationship, the current quantitative
   genetic models of IGE and inherited variability do not allow for such a
   relationship. The lack of quantitative genetic models that connect IGEs
   to inherited variability limits our understanding of the potential of
   variability to respond to selection, both in nature and agriculture.
   Models of trait levels, for example, show that IGEs may considerably
   change heritable variation in trait values. Currently, we lack the tools
   to investigate whether this result extends to variability of trait
   values. Here we present a model that integrates IGEs and inherited
   variability. In this model, the target phenotype, say growth rate, is a
   function of the genetic and environmental effects of the focal
   individual and of the difference in trait value between the social
   partner and the focal individual, multiplied by a regression
   coefficient. The regression coefficient is a genetic trait, which is a
   measure of cooperation; a negative value indicates competition, a
   positive value cooperation, and an increasing value due to selection
   indicates the evolution of cooperation. In contrast to the existing
   quantitative genetic models, our model allows for co-evolution of IGEs
   and variability, as the regression coefficient can respond to selection.
   Our simulations show that the model results in increased variability of
   body weight with increasing competition. When competition decreases,
   i.e., cooperation evolves, variability becomes significantly smaller.
   Hence, our model facilitates quantitative genetic studies on the
   relationship between IGEs and inherited variability. Moreover, our
   findings suggest that we may have been overlooking an entire level of
   genetic variation in variability, the one due to IGEs.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of aggression depends not only on the direct genetic
   effects (DGEs) of an individual's genes on its own behavior, but also on
   indirect genetic effects (IGEs) caused by heritable phenotypes expressed
   by social partners. IGEs can affect the amount of heritable variance on
   which selection can act. Despite the important roles of IGEs in the
   evolutionary process, it remains largely unknown whether the strength of
   IGEs varies across life stages or competitive regimes. Based on
   manipulations of nymphal densities and > 3000 pair-wise aggression tests
   across multiple life stages, we experimentally demonstrate that IGEs on
   aggression are stronger in field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) that
   develop at lower densities than in those that develop at higher
   densities, and that these effects persist with age. The existence of
   density-dependent IGEs implies that social interactions strongly
   determine the plastic expression of aggression when competition for
   resources is relaxed. A more competitive (higher density) rearing
   environment may fail to provide crickets with sufficient resources to
   develop social cognition required for strong IGEs. The contribution of
   IGEs to evolutionary responses was greater at lower densities. Our study
   thereby demonstrates the importance of considering IGEs in
   density-dependent ecological and evolutionary processes.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{2546-2552}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Several recent hypotheses suggest that parental care can influence the
   extent of phenotypic variation within populations; however, there have
   been few tests of these ideas. We exploited the facultative nature of
   posthatching parental care in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus
   vespilloides, to test whether parental care influences the expression of
   phenotypic variation in an important fitness trait (body size). We found
   that parental care and brood size (which influences sibling competition)
   had positive and independent effects on variation in body size. First,
   the mean coefficient of variation (CV) of body size was significantly
   greater in broods that received care than in those that did not. Second,
   CV body size increased with brood size in both parental care treatments.
   These results are not consistent with predictions from recent hypotheses
   that predict parental care will reduce phenotypic variation among
   siblings. The positive effects of parental care and brood size on
   phenotypic variation that we observed are likely due to sibling
   competition for access to provisioning parents and competition for
   limiting resources contained in the breeding carcass. Our results
   suggest that future theory linking parental care to the generation and
   maintenance of phenotypic variation must integrate the nature of
   interactions among family members.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{OCT 12}},
Abstract = {{Non-genetic influences on phenotypic traits can affect our
   interpretation of genetic variance and the evolutionary potential of
   populations to respond to selection, with consequences for our ability
   to predict the outcomes of selection. Long-term population surveys and
   experiments have shown that quantitative genetic estimates are
   influenced by nongenetic effects, including shared environmental
   effects, epigenetic effects, and social interactions. Recent
   developments to the ``animal model{''} of quantitative genetics can now
   allow us to calculate precise individual-based measures of non-genetic
   phenotypic variance. These models can be applied to a much broader range
   of contexts and data types than used previously, with the potential to
   greatly expand our understanding of nongenetic effects on evolutionary
   potential. Here, we provide the first practical guide for researchers
   interested in distinguishing between genetic and nongenetic causes of
   phenotypic variation in the animal model. The methods use matrices
   describing individual similarity in nongenetic effects, analogous to the
   additive genetic relatedness matrix. In a simulation of various
   phenotypic traits, accounting for environmental, epigenetic, or cultural
   resemblance between individuals reduced estimates of additive genetic
   variance, changing the interpretation of evolutionary potential. These
   variances were estimable for both direct and parental nongenetic
   variances. Our tutorial outlines an easy way to account for these
   effects in both wild and experimental populations. These models have the
   potential to add to our understanding of the effects of genetic and
   nongenetic effects on evolutionary potential. This should be of interest
   both to those studying heritability, and those who wish to understand
   nongenetic variance.}},

Abstract = {{1. For this study a cohort of melanic Harmonia axyridis males homozygous
   for the spectabilis allele was produced. These were used to produce four
   kinds of twice-mated females, comprising all four permutations of
   melanic and non-melanic (succinic) males. A series of 12 larvae were
   then reared from the first and 10th clutches of each female to compare
   progeny developmental phenotypes. 2. There were no effects of mating
   treatment on overall female reproductive performance (preoviposition
   period, 20-day fecundity, or egg fertility). 3. Age-specific maternal
   effects were evident in progeny developmental phenotypes; larvae of 10th
   clutches developed more slowly, pupation was shorter, and adults emerged
   at heavier weights. 4. Paternal effects were superimposed on maternal
   effects and affected progeny independent of their paternity; melanic
   males induced slower larval development and slower pupation, but only in
   10th clutches and only when they mated second. 5. There was a
   significant three-way interaction between male mating treatment, clutch
   number and progeny phenotype, indicating that progeny developmental
   responses to (mixed) paternal effects varied depending on their own
   phenotype and the time elapsed since their mother's last mating. 6.
   Melanic males mating second obtained a P2 advantage over succinic males,
   which increased from first to 10th clutch, but the reverse was not true
   when succinic males mated second. Thus, polyandry in H. axyridis
   facilitates both genetic and epigenetic competition among males while
   simultaneously enabling the sharing of predominant paternal effects
   among the progeny of different fathers.}},

Title = {{An integrated understanding of paternal care in mammals: lessons from
   the rodents}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY}},

Volume = {{306}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{69-76}},

Abstract = {{Mammalian paternal care is rare, and often considered synonymous with
   social monogamy. Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain the
   evolution and function of paternal care in mammals, many assuming that
   males are important for offspring survival, with accompanying costs and
   benefits to fathers and mothers. Most hypotheses are taxon-centric,
   focusing primarily on three mammalian orders. Consequently, there is no
   definitive `one size fits all' hypothesis that adequately explains the
   evolution of mammalian paternal care. Here, we review both proximate
   (ontogeny, mechanisms) and ultimate (adaptive significance, evolution)
   questions to provide an integrated perspective of paternal care,
   focussing on the rodents. Firstly, we describe the behavioural
   machinery, and then the neuroendocrine, genetic end environmental
   factors that regulate and modulate paternal care. We suggest that the
   behavioural machinery of parental care is conserved in both males and
   females, although parental care is regulated in a sex- and
   species-specific manner. Secondly, we provide hypotheses for the
   evolution and function of paternal care. In contrast to previous
   studies, we consider seven adaptive hypotheses that explore the
   possibility of paternal care benefiting the offspring, mothers and/or
   fathers. We also consider three constraints hypotheses. We suggest that
   paternal care does not have to incur a survival benefit to offspring to
   evolve. Instead, the combined benefits to fathers, mothers and offspring
   should out-weigh the costs to fathers of providing care. Our suggestions
   for integrating proximate and ultimate explanations for why and how male
   rodents provide paternal care are applicable across taxa. Integrating
   these explanations is complicated because the adaptive consequences are
   context and species-specific. Therefore, future research should
   integrate these approaches within and between a wide array of taxa.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{9, SI}},
Pages = {{750-769}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Chemicals released into the environment by food, predators and
   conspecifics play critical roles in Drosophila reproduction. Females and
   males live in an environment full of smells, whose molecules communicate
   to them the availability of food, potential mates, competitors or
   predators. Volatile chemicals derived from fruit, yeast growing on the
   fruit, and flies already present on the fruit attract Drosophila,
   concentrating flies at food sites, where they will also mate.
   Species-specific cuticular hydrocarbons displayed on female Drosophila
   as they mature are sensed by males and act as pheromones to stimulate
   mating by conspecific males and inhibit heterospecific mating. The
   pheromonal profile of a female is also responsive to her nutritional
   environment, providing an honest signal of her fertility potential.
   After mating, cuticular and semen hydrocarbons transferred by the male
   change the female's chemical profile. These molecules make the female
   less attractive to other males, thus protecting her mate's sperm
   investment. Females have evolved the capacity to counteract this
   inhibition by ejecting the semen hydrocarbon (along with the rest of the
   remaining ejaculate) a few hours after mating. Although this ejection
   can temporarily restore the female's attractiveness, shortly thereafter
   another male pheromone, a seminal peptide, decreases the female's
   propensity to re-mate, thus continuing to protect the male's investment.
   Females use olfaction and taste sensing to select optimal egg-laying
   sites, integrating cues for the availability of food for her offspring,
   and the presence of other flies and of harmful species. We argue that
   taking into account evolutionary considerations such as sexual conflict,
   and the ecological conditions in which flies live, is helpful in
   understanding the role of highly species-specific pheromones and blends
   thereof, as well as an individual's response to the chemical cues in its
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{In some ways, social spiders are a biological novelty item. They are not
   extraordinarily successful either evolutionarily or ecologically, and
   their societies suffer a variety of disadvantages that render them more
   brittle than other social systems. Yet, from an empiricist's
   perspective, these attributes make them uniquely poised for addressing a
   variety of research questions. Here we provide a brief overview of the
   biology of social spiders for the general reader. We then highlight a
   variety of ecological and evolutionary challenges suffered by these
   animals that renders them at risk of extinction in the short and long
   term. We finally discuss how these hardships have given rise to a
   variety of individual and group level adaptations that are rare or
   entirely absent in other spiders, as well as in most other social
   animals. Throughout this article, we highlight gaps in our current
   understanding of these creatures and draw attention to some of the more
   promising frontiers for future research. To this end, we have two goals.
   First, we would like to draw the attention of general behavioural
   ecologists interested in social evolution to the biology of social
   spiders, and emphasize a variety of reasons why one might consider these
   animals for their next research question. Second, for those already
   inculcated in the social spider literature, we hope that this article
   will raise the reader's consciousness to various underexplored but
   promising avenues for future research. With the right research question,
   social spiders promise to be a high-profile and high-throughput model
   system. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The Association for the

Abstract = {{How populations adapt, or not, to rapid evolution of sexual signals has
   important implications for population viability, but is difficult to
   assess due to the paucity of examples of sexual signals evolving in real
   time. In Hawaiian populations of the Pacific field cricket (Teleogryllus
   oceanicus), selection from a deadly parasitoid fly has driven the rapid
   loss of a male acoustic signal, calling song, that females use to locate
   and evaluate potential mates. In this newly quiet environment where many
   males are obligately silent, how do phonotactic females find mates?
   Previous work has shown that the acoustic rearing environment (presence
   or absence of male calling song) during late juvenile stages and early
   adulthood exposes adaptive flexibility in locomotor behaviors of males,
   as well as mating behaviors in both sexes that helps facilitate the
   spread of silent (flatwing) males. Here, we tested whether females also
   show acoustically induced plasticity in walking behaviors using
   laboratory-reared populations of T. oceanicus from Kauai (HI; >90\%
   flatwings), Oahu (HI; similar to 50\% flatwings), and Mangaia (Cook
   Islands; no flatwings or parasitoid fly). Though we predicted that
   females reared without song exposure would increase walking behaviors to
   facilitate mate localization when song is rare, we discovered that,
   unlike males, female T. oceanicus showed relatively little plasticity in
   exploratory behaviors in response to an acoustic rearing environment.
   Across all three populations, exposure to male calling song during
   development did not affect latency to begin walking, distance walked, or
   general activity of female crickets. However, females reared in the
   absence of song walked slower and showed a marginally non-significant
   tendency to walk for longer durations of time in a novel environment
   than those reared in the presence of song. Overall, plasticity in female
   walking behaviors appears unlikely to have facilitated sexual signal
   loss in this species.}},

Title = {{De novo oviduct transcriptome of the moor frog Rana arvalis: a quest for
   maternal effect candidate genes}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{Maternal effects can substantially affect ecological and evolutionary
   processes in natural populations. However, as they often are
   environmentally induced, establishing their genetic basis is
   challenging. One important, but largely neglected, source of maternal
   effects are egg coats (i.e., the maternally derived extracellular matrix
   that surrounds the embryo). In the moor frog, the gelatinous egg coats
   (i.e., egg jelly) are produced in the mother's oviduct and consist
   primarily of highly glycosylated mucin type O-glycans. These O-glycans
   affect jelly water balance and, subsequently, contribute to adaptive
   divergence in embryonic acid tolerance. To identify candidate genes for
   maternal effects, we conducted RNAseq transcriptomics on oviduct samples
   from seven R. arvalis females, representing the full range of within and
   among population variation in embryonic acid stress tolerance across our
   study populations. De novo sequencing of these oviduct transcriptomes
   detected 124,071 unigenes and functional annotation analyses identified
   a total of 57,839 unigenes, of which several identified genes likely
   code for variation in egg jelly coats. These belonged to two main

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic interference forces species to respond to changing
   environmental conditions. One possible response is dispersal and
   concomitant range shifts, allowing individuals to escape unfavourable
   conditions or to track the shifting climate niche. Range expansions
   depend on both dispersal capacity and the ability to establish
   populations beyond the former range. We here compare well-established
   core populations with recently established edge populations in the
   currently northward expanding butterfly Lycaena tityrus. Edge
   populations were characterized by shorter development times and smaller
   size, a higher sensitivity to high temperature and an enhanced
   exploratory behaviour. The differences between core and edge populations
   found suggest adaptation to local climates and an enhanced dispersal
   ability in edge populations. in particular, enhanced exploratory
   behaviour may be advantageous in all steps of the dispersal process and
   may have facilitated the current range expansion. This study describes
   differences associated with a current range expansion, knowledge which
   might be useful for a better understanding of species responses to
   environmental change. We further report on variation between males and
   females in morphology and flight behaviour, with males showing a longer
   flight endurance and more pronounced exploratory behaviour than females.}},

Title = {{Linking the fine-scale social environment to mating decisions: a future

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS}},

Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{Variation in extra-pair paternity (EPP) among individuals of the same
   population could result from stochastic demography or from individual
   differences in mating strategies. Although the adaptive value of EPP has
   been widely studied, much less is known about the characteristics of the
   social environment that drive the observed patterns of EPP. Here, we
   demonstrate how concepts and well-developed tools for the study of
   social behaviour (such as social network analysis) can enhance the study
   of extra-pair mating decisions (focussing in particular on avian mating
   systems). We present several hypotheses that describe how
   characteristics of the social environment in which individuals are
   embedded might influence the levels of EPP in a socially monogamous
   population. We use a multi-level social approach (Hinde, 1976) to
   achieve a detailed description of the social structure and social
   dynamics of individuals in a group. We propose that the pair-bond, the
   direct (local) social environment and the indirect (extended) social
   environment, can contribute in different ways to the variation observed
   in the patterns of EPP, at both the individual and the population level.
   A strength of this approach is that it integrates into the analysis
   (indirect) interactions with all potential mates in a population, thus
   extending the current framework to study extra-pair mating behaviour. We
   also encourage the application of social network methods such as
   temporal dynamic analysis to depict temporal changes in the patterns of
   interactions among individuals in a group, and to study how this affects
   mating behaviour. We argue that this new framework will contribute to a
   better understanding of the proximate mechanisms that drive variation in
   EPP within populations in socially monogamous species, and might
   ultimately provide insights into the evolution and maintenance of mating
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{In animal families, parents are expected to adapt to their offspring's
   traits, and offspring, in turn, are expected to adapt to the environment
   circumscribed by their parents. However, whether such coevolutionary
   trajectories differ between closely related species is poorly
   understood. Here, we employ interspecific cross-fostering in three
   species of burying beetles, Nicrophorus orbicollis, Nicrophorus
   pustulatus and Nicrophorus vespilloides, to test for divergent
   co-adaptation among species with different degrees of offspring
   dependency on parental care, and to test whether they are able to
   discriminate against interspecific parasites. We found that offspring
   survival was always higher when offspring were reared by conspecific
   rather than heterospecific parents. In the case of N. orbicollis raising
   N. pustulatus, none of the larvae survived. Overall, these results
   indicate that parent and offspring traits have diverged between species,
   and that the differential survival of conspecific and heterospecific
   larvae is because of improper matching of co-adapted traits, or, in the
   case of N. orbicollis with larval N. pustulatus, because of selection on
   parents to recognize and destroy interspecific brood parasites. We
   suggest that burying beetles experiencing a high risk of brood
   parasitism have evolved direct recognition mechanisms that enable them
   to selectively kill larvae of potential brood parasites.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Sexual selection generally involves males evolving secondary sexual
   characters that satisfy the mating preferences of females. Behavioral
   ecologists have spent considerable research effort on identifying how
   variation in sexually-selected traits in insects is maintained among
   males at the expense of investigating the proximate and ultimate causes
   of variation in female mating preferences for those male traits. The
   past decade has witnessed improved effort in redressing this bias in
   insects with researchers identifying a host of factors intrinsic and
   extrinsic to the female as mediating flexibility in female mating
   behavior. Evidence is mounting that a female's social environment,
   whether experienced during development or as an adult, is key to shaping
   her mating preferences. Others have extended these observations to show
   that the genetic identity of the conspecific individuals comprising the
   social environment can have profound effects on female mating
   preferences via indirect genetic effects (IGEs), or through
   interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGEs) if the genotype of
   heterospecifics influences plasticity in mating preferences.
   Considerably more work is needed to not only expand our list of
   mediating intrinsic and extrinsic factors but also to identify how their
   interaction influences individual variation in male and female mating
   preferences.}},

Title = {{Longitudinal analysis of direct and indirect effects on average daily
   gain in rabbits using a structured antedependence model}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{50}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Indirect genetic effects (IGE) are important components of
   various traits in several species Although the intensity of social
   interactions between partners likely vary over time, very few genetic
   studies have investigated how IGE vary over time for traits under
   selection in livestock species To overcome this issue, our aim was (1)
   to analyze longitudinal records of average daily gain (ADG) in rabbits
   subjected to a 5-week period of feed restriction using a structured
   antedependence (SAD) model that includes IGE and (2) to evaluate, by
   simulation, the response to selection when IGE are present and genetic
   evaluation is based on a SAD model that includes IGE or not.
   Results: The direct genetic variance for ADG (g/d) increased from week 1
   to 3 {[}from 8.03 to 13.47 (g/d)(2)] and then decreased {[}6.20 (g/d)(2)
   at week 5], while the indirect genetic variance decreased from week 1 to
   4 {[}from 0.43 to 0.22 (g/d)(2)] The correlation between the direct
   genetic effects of different weeks was moderate to high (ranging from
   0.46 to 0.86) and tended to decrease with time interval between
   measurements The same trend was observed for IGE for weeks 2 to 5
   (correlations ranging from 0.62 to 0.91) Estimates of the correlation
   between IGE of week 1 and IGE of the other weeks did not follow the same
   pattern and correlations were lower Estimates of correlations between
   direct and indirect effects were negative at all times After seven
   generations of simulated selection, the increase in ADG I from selection
   on EBV from a SAD model that included IGE was higher (similar to 30\%)
   than when those effects were omitted.
   Conclusions: Indirect genetic effects are larger just after mixing
   animals at weaning than later in the fattening I period, probably
   because of the establishment of social hierarchy that is generally
   observed at that time Accounting for IGE in the selection criterion
   maximizes genetic progress.}},

Abstract = {{Despite ample evidence for the presence of maternal effects (MEs) in a
   variety of traits and strong theoretical indications for their
   evolutionary consequences, empirical evidence to what extent MEs can
   influence evolutionary responses to selection remains ambiguous. We
   tested the degree to which MEs can alter the rate of adaptation of a key
   life-history trait, clutch size, using an individual-based model
   approach parameterized with experimental data from a long-term study of
   great tits (Parus major). We modeled two types of MEs: (i) an
   environmentally plastic ME, in which the relationship between maternal
   and offspring clutch size depended on the maternal environment via
   offspring condition, and (ii) a fixed ME, in which this relationship was
   constant. Although both types of ME affected the rate of adaptation
   following an abrupt environmental shift, the overall effects were small.
   We conclude that evolutionary consequences of MEs are modest at best in
   our study system, at least for the trait and the particular type of ME
   we considered here. A closer link between theoretical and empirical work
   on MEs would hence be useful to obtain accurate predictions about the
   evolutionary consequences of MEs more generally.}},

Abstract = {{Theory on indirect genetic effects (IGEs) indicates that variation in
   the genetic composition of social groups can generate GxG epistasis that
   may promote the evolution of stable polymorphisms. Using a livebearing
   fish with a genetic polymorphism in coloration and associated behavioral
   differences, we tested whether genotypes of social partners interacted
   with focal individual genotypes to influence growth and condition over
   16 weeks of development. We found that IGEs had a significant influence
   on patterns of feeding, regardless of focal fish genotype. There was no
   influence of social environment on juvenile length, but there was
   significant GxG epistasis for body condition. Each focal juvenile was in
   better condition when its own genotype was not present in adult social
   partners. These data are consistent with negative frequency-dependent
   selection in which each morph performs better when it is rare. Neither
   variation in feeding nor activity-related behaviors explained variation
   in body condition, suggesting that GxG epistasis for condition was
   caused by physiological differences between the two genotypes. These
   findings indicate that GxG epistasis in a given polymorphism can
   generate fitness landscapes that contribute to the maintenance of that
   polymorphism and to maintenance of genetic variation for additional
   fitness-related traits.}},

Abstract = {{The environment can have a considerable impact on behaviour. The social
   environment is predicted to be a particularly important driver of
   behavioural variation and evolution through the indirect genetic effects
   that arise whenever individuals interact with conspecifics. We used male
   Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, to examine the
   effects of changes in the social environment (recorded acoustic sexual
   signals of other males) on the expression and consistency of boldness,
   activity and exploration, and their between-individual covariation.
   Switching from a silent environment to being exposed to male acoustic
   sexual signals resulted in crickets becoming less bold, active and
   explorative. Switching from an acoustic to a silent environment resulted
   in increased boldness and activity. We also looked at the effects of
   changes in the nonsocial environment via a physical disturbance that
   mimicked the presence of a potential predator (mechanical shaking). The
   effects of physical disturbance (and changes thereof) on behaviour were
   far less pronounced than the effects of changes in the social
   environment. Neither the repeatability of nor correlations between
   behaviours were affected by changes in physical disturbance. Only the
   average level of exploration was affected significantly when crickets
   were moved from an undisturbed to a disturbed environment, with crickets
   becoming less explorative. Although changes in the social and the
   nonsocial environment affected the repeatability of and correlations
   between some of the behaviours measured, changes in the social
   environment had the greater effect. We discuss the ecological and
   evolutionary implications of our findings and how they relate to our
   current understanding of social and nonsocial environmental effects on
   behaviour. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Background: Arman sheep breed was synthesized by crossing several
   breeds, including Baluchi, Ghezel, Chios, and Suffolk. Objective: To
   estimate the (co)variance components and genetic parameters using the
   restricted maximum likelihood via twelve animal models for lamb survival
   and four animal models for ewe productivity traits. Methods: Data and
   pedigree information were collected at Abbesabad Sheep Breeding Station,
   Khorasan Razavi province, north-east of Iran, from 1999 to 2011. The
   traits studied were lamb survival rate (LSR), litter size at birth
   (LSB), litter size at weaning (LSW), litter mean weight per lambing
   (LMWL), litter mean weight per lamb weaned (LMWLW), total litter weight
   at birth (TLWB), and total litter weight at weaning (TI,WW). Moreover,
   multivariate analyses were performed to estimate covariance between the
   traits. Results: Direct heritability estimates (h(2)a) for LSR was 0.081
   and increased to 0.253 after correcting. Maternal genetic effects (hem)
   and common litter effects (l(2)) accounted for 4 and 11.3\% of the
   phenotypic variance for LSR, respectively. The estimations of h(2)a were
   0.131, 0.080, 0.111, 0.190, 0.118, and 0.150 for LSB, LSW, LMWL, LMWLW,
   TLWB, and TLWW, respectively. The estimated fractions of variance
   -attributed to permanent environmental effects on ewe, (pe(2)) were
   0.038, 0.050, 0.071, 0.060, and 0.050 for LSB, LSW, LMWL, TLWB, and
   TLWW, respectively. Service sire effects (S-2) were significant for LSW,
   LMWL, and TLWB, being 0.038, 0.030, and 0.049, respectively. Direct
   genetic correlations showed a vast range from 0.13 for LSB-LMWL to 0.91
   for LMWL-TLWW. Conclusion: Results indicate that genetic change not only
   depends on the heritability of traits, but also on the observed
   phenotypic variation; therefore, improvement of non-genetic factors
   should be included in the breeding programs.}},

Abstract = {{Saraca asoca (Roxb.) De Wilde is an important medicinal plant from the
   Western Ghats of India, traditionally used in treatment of various
   gynecological disorders. Increasing commercial demand and decreasing
   numbers has resulted in this plant becoming endangered with crude drug
   materials being extensively substituted/adulterated with other plant
   species. The present study was undertaken with the objective of
   development and evaluation of multivariate cluster analysis of ISSR
   fingerprints against rbcL-based DNA barcodes as tool to understand the
   relationships and to differentiate common adulterants and substituents
   from S. asoca. ISSR-based Hierarchical Cluster Analysis was carried out
   on 41 samples of S. asoca and 5 each of the 5 common
   substituent/adulterant plants and the clustering patterns were evaluated
   against DNA-sequence-based barcoding of rbcL region of their plastids.
   Factorial analysis and Principal Coordinate Analysis revealed distinct
   groups of genetic pools of respective taxa thereby confirming the
   utility of ISSR fingerprinting as a useful tool for differentiation
   between the genuine and the adulterants/substituents. NCBI-BLAST search
   on DNA barcode rbcL region confirmed the results of ISSR assays.
   Therefore, our study demonstrated the utility of simple, cost-effective
   method of ISSR fingerprinting coupled with rbcL barcoding in
   differentiating this important medicinal plant from its common
   adulterants/substituents.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{What was once expensive and revolutionary full-genome sequenceis now
   affordable and routine. Costs will continue to drop, opening up new
   frontiers in behavioral genetics. This shift in costs from the genome to
   the phenome is most notable in large clinical studies of behavior and
   associated diseases in cohorts that exceed hundreds of thousands of
   subjects. Examples include the Women's Health Initiative (www.whl.org),
   the Million Veterans Program (www.research.va.gov/MVP), the 100000
   Genomes Project (genomicsengland.co.uk) and commercial efforts such as
   those by deCode (www.decode.com) and 23 and me (www.23andme.com). The
   same transition is happening in experimental neuro- and behavioral
   genetics, and sample sizes of many hundreds of cases are becoming
   routine (www.genenetwork.org, www.mousephenotyping.org). There are two
   major consequences of this new affordability of massive omics datasets:
   (1) it is now far more practical to explore genetic modulation of
   behavioral differences and the key role of gene-by-environment
   interactions. Researchers are already doing the hard part the
   quantitative analysis of behavior. Adding the omics component can
   provide powerful links to molecules, cells, circuits and even better
   treatment. (2) There is an acute need to highlight and train behavioral
   scientists in how best to exploit new omics approaches. This review
   addresses this second issue and highlights several new trends and
   opportunities that will be of interest to experts in animal and human
   behaviors.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{289-300}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{``Nurture{''} depends on the ``nature{''} of social partners. The
   behavior of a young male mosquitofish depends on genetic differences in
   his social partners and on his own genes. Social partners that are
   genetically dark or light colored affect the behavior differently. But,
   dark-colored males respond less to social differences than light males,
   and receive different behaviors from social partners. So, even
   apparently innate differences related to color can be caused by
   differences in the behavior of social partners.The social environment
   can dramatically influence the development and expression of individual
   behavior. Indirect genetic effects (IGE) arise when variation in the
   social environment depends on genotypic differences among social
   partners. Their role in generating variation and influencing
   evolutionary dynamics has become increasingly recognized in recent
   years, but less attention has been paid to how IGE arise during
   development. We measured the development of IGE using a discrete natural
   polymorphism in male coloration and associated behaviors in eastern
   mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). We observed substantial IGE and
   direct genetic effects on behavior. For some behaviors, IGE changed and
   even reversed direction over the 16 weeks of the experiment, indicating
   important developmental dynamics. Interaction between IGE and direct
   genetic effects for some behaviors suggests that melanistic males were
   less responsive to a genetic change in their social environment than
   nonmelanistic males were. Alternately, social partners might vary less
   in the behavior they direct toward melanistic males. Color morphs
   differed in mating behavior and in aggressive behavior they received
   from social partners, but not in direct measures of aggression.
   Therefore, even apparently innate differences in behavior between morphs
   could arise as indirect effects of differences in behavior directed
   toward them by social partners. These results indicate that some
   differences attributed to melanism in this and other species might
   result from color morphs experiencing different social environments.
   Deducing the developmental and social origins of these indirect effects
   is therefore critical for understanding melanism-associated behavioral
   variation in the many species in which it occurs.}},

   such effects should be interpreted and studied. Some authors have
   suggested that condition-transfer effects result simply from resource
   limitation constraints (passive condition transfer, or transmissive
   effects). However, condition transfer can also reflect evolved parental
   investment strategies (active condition-transfer effects). In some
   species, such strategies can involve cryptic mechanisms such as
   epigenetic inheritance. As recently shown in this journal by Engqvist
   and Reinhold, condition-transfer effects can be obscured by anticipatory
   effects and interactions between the effects of parental and offspring
   environments. Nonetheless, we argue that these complications can be
   largely overcome by examining a broad range of ecologically relevant
   environments in both parental and offspring generations. This can be
   accomplished by adapting a powerful methodology from the nutritional
   sciencesthe geometric frameworkto research on parental effects.}},

Volume = {{136}},

Abstract = {{Network dynamics can reveal information about the adaptive function of
   social behaviour and the extent to which social relationships can
   flexibly respond to extrinsic pressures. Changes in social networks
   occur following changes to the social and physical environment. By
   contrast, we have limited understanding of whether changes in social
   networks precede major group events. Permanent evictions can be
   important determinants of gene flow and population structure and are a
   clear example of an event that might be preceded by social network
   dynamics. Here we examined the social networks of a group of rhesus
   macaques, Macaca mulatta, in the 2 years leading up to the eviction of
   22\% of adult females, which are the philopatric sex. We found that
   females engaged in the same amount of aggression and grooming in the 2
   years leading up to the eviction but that there were clear changes in
   their choice of social partners. Females that would eventually be
   evicted received more aggression from lower-ranking females as the
   eviction approached. Evicted females also became more discriminating in
   their grooming relationships in the year nearer the split, showing a
   greater preference for one another and becoming more cliquish. Put
   simply, the females that would later be evicted continued to travel with
   the rest of the group as the eviction approached but were less likely to
   interact with other group members in an affiliative manner. These
   results have potential implications for understanding group cohesion and
   the balance between cooperation and competition that mediates social
   groups. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Offspring traits are greatly influenced by maternal effects, and these
   maternal effects may provide an important pathway through which
   populations can adapt to changing thermal environments. We investigated
   the effect of egg size on the among- and within-population variation in
   early life history traits among introduced Great Lakes Chinook salmon
   (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations under varying thermal conditions.
   We reared Chinook salmon from three populations in a common-garden
   hatchery study at 6.5, 9.4, and 15.2 degrees C and measured a variety of
   fitness-related traits during development. We found that most of the
   among-population variation in early life history traits was explained by
   egg size. However, the contribution of egg size to the among-population
   variation decreased with an increase in temperature suggesting that
   other effects, such as genetic, contribute at high temperature. Within
   populations, egg size explained much of the dam variance and maternal
   effect for traits in every temperature, whereas egg size generally had
   little to no influence on the sire variance and heritability. Overall,
   our results demonstrate the significant contribution egg size makes to
   shaping early life history phenotypes among and within populations, and
   suggest that egg size is an important pathway through which offspring
   phenotypes can evolve on contemporary timescales.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation in resident species can influence the assembly and
   dynamics of communities, but the potential for these genetic effects to
   persist across generations is largely unresolved. In principle,
   persistent, directional changes in communities are only predicted when
   community properties covary genetically with the fitness of resident
   species.
   Estimates of genetic covariance between the fitness of a resident
   species and its community are therefore necessary to ``close the
   eco-evolutionary loop{''} in studies of community genetics, but such
   estimates are rare. Emulating community genetics experiments in plants,
   we used clonal replicates of 21 genotypes of a resident species (the
   encrusting bryozoan, Hippopodina) to investigate the magnitude of
   genotypic variance contributing to assembly of a marine benthic
   community.
   Genotypes explained up to 35\% of variation in community assembly.
   Critically, the performance of Hippopodina genotypes covaried both with
   the evenness of communities and with the abundances of some individual
   species, representing an indirect genetic effect that creates the
   potential for multigenerational interactions between Hippopodina and
   co-existing species. Our results suggest that different genotypes will
   associate with different community members consistently across
   generations, and such non-random associations can give rise to
   specialization. Further interactions between species other than
   Hippopodina itself may also be altered by effects of genetic variation
   in the focal species.
   Furthermore, species in the community other than Hippopodina itself will
   interact more commonly in the presence of some genotypes over others.
   Our results support the potential for genetic variation in one species
   to have deterministic effects on the dynamics of ecological communities.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects are widely observed, but their adaptive nature remains
   difficult to describe and interpret. We investigated adaptive maternal
   effects in a clone of the crustacean Daphnia magna, experimentally
   varying both maternal age and maternal food and subsequently varying
   food available to offspring. We had two main predictions: that offspring
   in a food environment matched to their mothers should fare better than
   offspring in unmatched environments, and that offspring of older mothers
   would fare better in low food environments. We detected numerous
   maternal effects, for example offspring of poorly fed mothers were
   large, whereas offspring of older mothers were both large and showed an
   earlier age at first reproduction. However, these maternal effects did
   not clearly translate into the predicted differences in reproduction.
   Thus, our predictions about adaptive maternal effects in response to
   food variation were not met in this genotype ofDaphnia magna.}},

Title = {{Heterospecific Nest Site Copying Behavior in a Wild Bird: Assessing the
   Influence of Genetics and Past Experience on a Joint Breeding Phenotype}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Breeding site selection is often a joint decision of pair members in
   species with biparental care and the experience of both pair members may
   influence the use of information for site selection. Nevertheless,
   quantitative genetics of joint information use for site selection
   remains unexplored so far. We used an experimental approach to quantify
   the relative importance of genetics (heritability) and past experience
   (age, familiarity with the environment, previous breeding success,
   previous information use) in heterospecific social information use for
   nest site selection in wild collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis).
   Flycatchers collect social information from resident tits for nest site
   selection. We created an apparent preference of tits for a novel nest
   site feature and recorded choices of flycatchers (copying or rejecting
   the tit preference). Copying behavior was stronger for naive individuals
   but also differed between years, which could be explained by contrasting
   seasonality in the demonstrator species. Past experience as reflected by
   age affected subsequent use of social information: pairs with a yearling
   male were more likely to copy the heterospecific preference than pairs
   with older immigrant males. There was no general pattern in successive
   individual choices over the years. Accordingly, individual repeatability
   in copying tit preference was very low. At the pair level, we estimated
   sex-specific direct and indirect genetic effects on the joint nest site
   decision and found no sex-specific heritability and no cross-sex genetic
   correlation. Our results confirm the importance of past experience for
   social information use and suggest that social information use is highly
   plastic and most likely not genetically inherited in collared
   flycatchers. Whether individuals use social information should be
   related to environmentally-induced changes in the quality of information
   and thus be context-dependent. Selection may therefore act on the
   ability to optimally use social information in varying environments and
   on the processes underlying such adjustment, such as learning, rather
   than the use of information itself.}},

Abstract = {{Humans tend to form social relationships with others who resemble them.
   Whether this sorting of like with like arises from historical patterns
   of migration, meso-level social structures in modern society, or
   individual-level selection of similar peers remains unsettled. Recent
   research has evaluated the possibility that unobserved genotypes may
   play an important role in the creation of homophilous relationships. We
   extend this work by using data from 5,500 adolescents from the National
   Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to examine
   genetic similarities among pairs of friends. Although there is some
   evidence that friends have correlated genotypes, both at the
   whole-genome level as well as at trait-associated loci (via polygenic
   scores), further analysis suggests that meso-level forces, such as
   school assignment, are a principal source of genetic similarity between
   friends. We also observe apparent socialgenetic effects in which
   polygenic scores of an individual's friends and schoolmates predict the
   individual's own educational attainment. In contrast, an individual's
   height is unassociated with the height genetics of peers.}},

Title = {{Indirect genetic effects in behavioral ecology: does behavior play a

Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-11}},

Abstract = {{Behavior is rapidly flexible and highly context-dependent, which poses
   obvious challenges to researchers attempting to dissect its causes.
   However, over a century of unresolved debate has also focused on whether
   the very flexibility and context-dependence of behavior lends it a
   unique role in the evolutionary origins and patterns of diversity in the
   Animal Kingdom. Here, we propose that both challenges can benefit from
   studying how indirect genetic effects (IGEs: the effects of genes
   expressed in one individual on traits in another individual) shape
   behavioral phenotypes. We provide a sketch of the theoretical framework
   that grounds IGEs in behavioral ecology research and focus on recent
   advances made from studies of IGEs in areas of behavioral ecology such
   as sexual selection, sexual conflict, social dominance, and
   parent-offspring interactions. There is mounting evidence that IGEs have
   important influences on behavioral phenotypes associated with these
   processes, such as sexual signals and preferences and behaviors which
   function to manipulate interacting partners. IGEs can also influence
   both responses to selection and selection itself, and considering IGEs
   refines evolutionary predictions and provides new perspectives on the
   origins of seemingly perplexing behavioral traits. A key unresolved
   question, but one that has dominated the behavioral sciences for over a
   century, is whether behavior is more likely than other types of traits
   to contribute to evolutionary change and diversification. We advocate
   taking advantage of an IGE approach to outline falsifiable hypotheses
   and a general methodology to rigorously test this frequently proposed,
   yet still contentious, special role of behavior in evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Microbes colonizing a surface often experience colony growth dynamics
   characterized by an initial phase of spatial clonal expansion followed
   by collision between neighboring colonies to form potentially
   genetically heterogeneous boundaries. For species with life cycles
   consisting of repeated surface colonization and dispersal, these
   spatially explicit expansion-collision dynamics generate periodic
   transitions between two distinct selective regimes, expansion
   competition and boundary competition, each one favoring a different
   growth strategy. We hypothesized that this dynamic could promote stable
   coexistence of expansion- and boundary-competition specialists by
   generating time-varying, negative frequency-dependent selection that
   insulates both types from extinction. We tested this experimentally in
   budding yeast by competing an exoenzyme secreting cooperator strain
   (expansion-competition specialists) against nonsecreting defectors
   (boundary-competition specialists). As predicted, we observed
   cooperator-defector coexistence or cooperator dominance with
   expansion-collision dynamics, but only defector dominance otherwise.
   Also as predicted, the steady-state frequency of cooperators was
   determined by colonization density (the average initial cell-cell
   distance) and cost of cooperation. Lattice-based spatial simulations
   give good qualitative agreement with experiments, supporting our
   hypothesis that expansion-collision dynamics with costly public goods
   production is sufficient to generate stable cooperator-defector
   coexistence. This mechanism may be important for maintaining
   public-goods cooperation and conflict in microbial pioneer species
   living on surfaces.}},

Title = {{Phenotypic and genetic integration of personality and growth under
   competition in the sheepshead swordtail, Xiphophorus birchmanni}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{187-201}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Competition for resources including food, physical space, and potential
   mates is a fundamental ecological process shaping variation in
   individual phenotype and fitness. The evolution of competitive ability,
   in particular social dominance, depends on genetic (co)variation among
   traits causal (e.g., behavior) or consequent (e.g., growth) to
   competitive outcomes. If dominance is heritable, it will generate both
   direct and indirect genetic effects (IGE) on resource-dependent traits.
   The latter are expected to impose evolutionary constraint because
   winners necessarily gain resources at the expense of losers. We varied
   competition in a population of sheepshead swordtails, Xiphophorus
   birchmanni, to investigate effects on behavior, size, growth, and
   survival. We then applied quantitative genetic analyses to determine (i)
   whether competition leads to phenotypic and/or genetic integration of
   behavior with life history and (ii) the potential for IGE to constrain
   life history evolution. Size, growth, and survival were reduced at high
   competition. Male dominance was repeatable and dominant individuals show
   higher growth and survival. Additive genetic contributions to phenotypic
   covariance were significant, with the G matrix largely recapitulating
   phenotypic relationships. Social dominance has a low but significant
   heritability and is strongly genetically correlated with size and
   growth. Assuming causal dependence of growth on dominance, hidden IGE
   will therefore reduce evolutionary potential.}},

Abstract = {{How has evolution led to the variation in behavioural phenotypes
   (personalities) in a population? Knowledge of whether personality is
   heritable, and to what degree it is influenced by the social
   environment, is crucial to understanding its evolutionary significance,
   yet few estimates are available from natural populations. We tracked
   three behavioural traits during different life-history stages in a
   pedigreed population of wild house sparrows. Using a quantitative
   genetic approach, we demonstrated heritability in adult exploration, and
   in nestling activity after accounting for fixed effects, but not in
   adult boldness. We did not detect maternal effects on any traits, but we
   did detect a social brood effect on nestling activity. Boldness,
   exploration and nestling activity in this population did not form a
   behavioural syndrome, suggesting that selection could act independently
   on these behavioural traits in this species, although we found no
   consistent support for phenotypic selection on these traits. Our work
   shows that repeatable behaviours can vary in their heritability and that
   social context influences personality traits. Future efforts could
   separate whether personality traits differ in heritability because they
   have served specific functional roles in the evolution of the phenotype
   or because our concept of personality and the stability of behaviour
   needs to be revised.}},

Journal = {{GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Female post-mating behaviors are regulated by complex factors involving
   males, females, and the environment. In insects, plant secondary
   compounds that males actively forage for, may indirectly modify female
   behaviors by altering male behavior and physiology. In the tephritid
   fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni, females mated with males previously fed on
   plant-derived phenylpropanoids (= ``lures{''} based on usage in
   tephritid literature), have longer mating refractoriness, greater
   fecundity, and reduced longevity than females mated with non-lure fed
   males. This system thus provides a model for studying transcriptional
   changes associated with those post-mating behaviors, as the genes
   regulating the phenotypic changes are likely to be expressed at a
   greater magnitude than in control females. We performed comparative
   transcriptome analyses using virgin B. tryoni females, females mated
   with control males (control-mated), and females mated with lure-fed
   males (lure-mated). We found 331 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
   in control-mated females and 80 additional DEGs in lure-mated females.
   Although DEGs in control-mated females are mostly immune response genes
   and chorion proteins, as reported in Drosophila species, DEGs in
   lure-mated females are titin-like muscle proteins, histones, sperm, and
   testis expressed proteins which have not been previously reported. While
   transcripts regulating mating (e.g., lingerer) did not show differential
   expression in either of the mated female classes, the odorant binding
   protein Obp56a was down-regulated. The exclusively enriched or
   suppressed genes in lure-mated females, novel transcripts such as titin
   and histones, and several taxa-specific transcripts reported here can
   shed more light on post-mating transcriptional changes, and this can
   help understand factors possibly regulating female post-mating
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Parental care is critical for fitness, yet little is known about its
   genetic basis. Here, we estimate the heritability of parenting behaviour
   in a species famous for its diversity and its behavioural repertoire:
   three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Male three-spined
   stickleback are the sole providers of parental care that is necessary
   for offspring survival; therefore, this system offers the opportunity to
   study the inheritance of parental behaviour when selection is primarily
   acting on males. Fanning behaviour is a conspicuous parental behaviour
   that is readily quantified in this species. We show that the
   heritability of fanning behaviour is >= 0.9 and significantly different
   from zero within a freshwater population. Moreover, there was abundant
   genetic variation for fanning behaviour, indicating that it could
   readily evolve. These results suggest that parenting behaviour is
   tractable for further genetic dissection in this system.}},

Title = {{Quantitative Genetic Modeling of the Parental Care Hypothesis for the
   Evolution of Endothermy}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{There are two heuristic explanations proposed for the evolution of
   endothermy in vertebrates: a correlated response to selection for stable
   body temperatures, or as a correlated response to increased activity.
   Parental care has been suggested as a major driving force in this
   context given its impact on the parents' activity levels and energy
   budgets, and in the offspring's growth rates due to food provisioning
   and controlled incubation temperature. This results in a complex
   scenario involving multiple traits and transgenerational fitness
   benefits that can be hard to disentangle, quantify and ultimately test.
   Here we demonstrate how standard quantitative genetic models of maternal
   effects can be applied to study the evolution of endothermy, focusing on
   the interplay between daily energy expenditure (DEE) of the mother and
   growth rates of the offspring. Our model shows that maternal effects can
   dramatically exacerbate evolutionary responses to selection in
   comparison to regular univariate models (breeder's equation). This
   effect would emerge from indirect selection mediated by maternal effects
   concomitantly with a positive genetic covariance between DEE and growth
   rates. The multivariate nature of selection, which could favor a higher
   DEE, higher growth rates or both, might partly explain how high turnover
   rates were continuously favored in a self-reinforcing process. Overall,
   our quantitative genetic analysis provides support for the parental care
   hypothesis for the evolution of endothermy. We contend that much has to
   be gained from quantifying maternal and developmental effects on
   metabolic and thermoregulatory variation during adulthood.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The social environment is both an important agent of selection for most
   organisms, and an emergent property of their interactions. As an
   aggregation of interactions among members of a population, the social
   environment is a product of many sets of relationships and so can be
   represented as a network or matrix. Social network analysis in animals
   has focused on why these networks possess the structure they do, and
   whether individuals' network traits, representing some aspect of their
   social phenotype, relate to their fitness. Meanwhile, quantitative
   geneticists have demonstrated that traits expressed in a social context
   can depend on the phenotypes and genotypes of interacting partners,
   leading to influences of the social environment on the traits and
   fitness of individuals and the evolutionary trajectories of populations.
   Therefore, both fields are investigating similar topics, yet have
   arrived at these points relatively independently. We review how these
   approaches are diverged, and yet how they retain clear parallelism and
   so strong potential for complementarity. This demonstrates that, despite
   separate bodies of theory, advances in one might inform the other.
   Techniques in network analysis for quantifying social phenotypes, and
   for identifying community structure, should be useful for those studying
   the relationship between individual behaviour and group-level
   phenotypes. Entering social association matrices into quantitative
   genetic models may also reduce bias in heritability estimates, and allow
   the estimation of the influence of social connectedness on trait
   expression. Current methods for measuring natural selection in a social
   context explicitly account for the fact that a trait is not necessarily
   the property of a single individual, something the network approaches
   have not yet considered when relating network metrics to individual
   fitness. Harnessing evolutionary models that consider traits affected by
   genes in other individuals (i.e. indirect genetic effects) provides the
   potential to understand how entire networks of social interactions in
   populations influence phenotypes and predict how these traits may
   evolve. By theoretical integration of social network analysis and
   quantitative genetics, we hope to identify areas of compatibility and
   incompatibility and to direct research efforts towards the most
   promising areas. Continuing this synthesis could provide important
   insights into the evolution of traits expressed in a social context and
   the evolutionary consequences of complex and nuanced social phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{The unusually long lifespans of humans and the persistence of
   post-reproductive lifespans in women represent evolutionary puzzles
   because natural selection cannot directly favour continued living in
   post-menopausal women or elderly men. Suggested sources of indirect
   selection require genetic correlations between fitness and survival or
   reproduction at younger ages, reproduction in the opposite sex, or
   late-life contributions to offspring or grandoffspring fitness. Here we
   apply quantitative genetic analyses to data from a historical human
   population to explicitly test these evolutionary genetic hypotheses.
   Total genetic selection increased the male post-50 lifespans by 0.138
   years per generation; 94\% of this arose from indirect selection acting
   to favour early-life fitness in both sexes. These results argue strongly
   against life-history models of ageing that depend on trade-offs between
   reproduction and late-life survival. No source of indirect selection for
   female post-50 lifespan was detected, deepening the mystery of why
   female post-reproductive survival persists. This result is probably due
   to recent changes in the genetic architecture of female lifespan, and it
   highlights the need for similar quantitative genetic analyses of human
   populations at other points along demographic transitions.}},

Title = {{Evolutionary biology today and the call for an extended synthesis}},
Journal = {{INTERFACE FOCUS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{Evolutionary theory has been extended almost continually since the
   evolutionary synthesis (ES), but except for the much greater importance
   afforded genetic drift, the principal tenets of the ES have been
   strongly supported. Adaptations are attributable to the sorting of
   genetic variation by natural selection, which remains the only known
   cause of increase in fitness. Mutations are not adaptively directed, but
   as principal authors of the ES recognized, the material (structural)
   bases of biochemistry and development affect the variety of phenotypic
   variations that arise by mutation and recombination. Against this
   historical background, I analyse major propositions in the movement for
   an `extended evolutionary synthesis'. `Niche construction' is a new
   label for a wide variety of well-known phenomena, many of which have
   been extensively studied, but (as with every topic in evolutionary
   biology) some aspects may have been understudied. There is no reason to
   consider it a neglected `process' of evolution. The proposition that
   phenotypic plasticity may engender new adaptive phenotypes that are
   later genetically assimilated or accommodated is theoretically
   plausible; it may be most likely when the new phenotype is not truly
   novel, but is instead a slight extension of a reaction norm already
   shaped by natural selection in similar environments. However, evolution
   in new environments often compensates for maladaptive plastic phenotypic
   responses. The union of population genetic theory with mechanistic
   understanding of developmental processes enables more complete
   understanding by joining ultimate and proximate causation; but the
   latter does not replace or invalidate the former. Newly discovered
   molecular phenomena have been easily accommodated in the past by
   elaborating orthodox evolutionary theory, and it appears that the same
   holds today for phenomena such as epigenetic inheritance. In several of
   these areas, empirical evidence is needed to evaluate enthusiastic
   speculation. Evolutionary theory will continue to be extended, but there
   is no sign that it requires emendation.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptic evolution occurs when evolutionary change is masked by
   concurrent environmental change. In most cases, evolutionary changes in
   the phenotype are masked by changing abiotic factors. However,
   evolutionary change in one trait might also be masked by evolutionary
   change in another trait, a phenomenon referred to as evolutionary
   environmental deterioration. Nevertheless, detecting this second type of
   cryptic evolution is challenging and there are few compelling examples.
   Here, we describe a likely case of evolutionary environmental
   deterioration occurring in experimental burying beetle (Nicrophorus
   vespilloides) populations that are adapting to a novel social
   environment that lacks post-hatching parental care. We found that
   populations rapidly adapted to the removal of post-hatching parental
   care. This adaptation involved clear increases in breeding success and
   larval density (number of dispersing larvae produced per gram of
   breeding carcass), which in turn masked a concurrent increase in the
   mean larval mass across generations. This cryptic increase in larval
   mass was accomplished through a change in the reaction norm that relates
   mean larval mass to larval density. Our results suggest that cryptic
   evolution might be commonplace in animal families, because evolving
   trophic and social interactions can potentially mask evolutionary change
   in other traits, like body size.}},

Abstract = {{Although many selection estimates have been published, the environmental
   factors that cause selection to vary in space and time have rarely been
   identified. One way to identify these factors is by experimentally
   manipulating the environment and measuring selection in each treatment.
   We compiled and analyzed selection estimates from experimental studies.
   First, we tested whether the effect of manipulating the environment on
   selection gradients depends on taxon, trait type, or fitness component.
   We found that the effect of manipulating the environment was larger when
   selection was measured on life-history traits or via survival. Second,
   we tested two predictions about the environmental factors that cause
   variation in selection. We found support for the prediction that
   variation in selection is more likely to be caused by environmental
   factors that have a large effect on mean fitness but not for the
   prediction that variation is more likely to be caused by biotic factors.
   Third, we compared selection gradients from experimental and
   observational studies. We found that selection varied more among
   treatments in experimental studies than among spatial and temporal
   replicates in observational studies, suggesting that experimental
   studies can detect relationships between environmental factors and
   selection that would not be apparent in observational studies.}},

Abstract = {{An individual's genes may influence the phenotype of neighboring
   conspecifics. Such indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are important as they
   can affect the apparent total heritable variance in a population, and
   thus the response to selection. We studied these effects in a large,
   pedigreed population of Eucalyptus globulus using variance component
   analyses of Mycosphearella leaf disease, diameter growth at age 2 years,
   and post-infection diameter growth at ages 4 and 8 years. In a novel
   approach, we initially modeled IGEs using a factor analytic (FA)
   structure to identify the most influential neighbor positions, with the
   FA loadings being position-specific regressions on the IGEs. This
   involved sequentially comparing FA models for the variance-covariance
   matrices of the direct and indirect effects of each neighbor. We then
   modeled IGEs as a distance-based, combined effect of the most
   influential neighbors. This often increased the magnitude and
   significance of indirect genetic variance estimates relative to using
   all neighbors. The extension of a univariate IGEs model to bivariate
   analyses also provided insights into the genetic architecture of this
   population, revealing that: (1) IGEs arising from increased probability
   of neighbor infection were not associated with reduced growth of
   neighbors, despite adverse fitness effects being evident at the direct
   genetic level; and (2) the strong, genetic-based competitive
   interactions for growth, established early in stand development, were
   highly positively correlated over time. Our results highlight the
   complexities of genetic-based interactions at the multi-trait level due
   to (co) variances associated with IGEs, and the marked discrepancy
   occurring between direct and total heritable variances.}},

Abstract = {{The origins of agriculture date to about 9000 years, but commercial
   culture and supplementation of marine populations reach back only a few
   centuries. Hence, wild populations still play a major role in seafood
   production. Closed culture, stock restorations, sea ranching and stock
   enhancements of marine fishes and invertebrates have been implemented
   with various outcomes. A review of the literature indicates that
   considerable effort has been directed toward culture technologies to
   maximize production, but scant attention has been given to genetic risks
   to wild populations. Genetic risks from stock enhancements can be
   substantial, because of inattention to brood-stock sizes, and because
   hybridization between hatchery-reared and wild individuals can lower the
   fitness or lead to the extinction of a natural population. In many
   cases, small brood-stock sizes have led to the loss of genetic
   diversity. In some cases, hatchery-reared individuals appear to have
   replaced, rather than supplemented, wild populations. Here, we outline a
   responsible approach to managing genetic resources that includes six
   steps: (1) assess the costs and benefits of a stock restoration or
   enhancement, (2) set goals and genetic benchmarks, (3) use appropriate
   brood stock and limit domestication, (4) design release strategies that
   maximize the effectiveness of supplementation efforts, (5) track
   individuals after release and (6) minimize genetic impacts on wild
   populations. Stock supplementation is often viewed as an immediate
   solution to a stock decline, but should be undertaken as a last resort
   because of the high cost of implementation and the substantial
   ecological and genetic risks to wild populations.}},

Title = {{Indirect genetic effects: a key component of the genetic architecture of
   behaviour}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural ecology research increasingly focuses on why genetic
   behavioural variation can persist despite selection. Evolutionary theory
   predicts that directional selection leads to evolutionary change while
   depleting standing genetic variation. Nevertheless, evolutionary stasis
   may occur for traits involved in social interactions. This requires
   tight negative genetic correlations between direct genetic effects
   (DGEs) of an individual's genes on its own phenotype and the indirect
   genetic effects (IGEs) it has on conspecifics, as this could diminish
   the amount of genetic variation available to selection to act upon. We
   tested this prediction using a pedigreed laboratory population of
   Mediterranean field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus), in which both
   exploratory tendency and aggression are heritable. We found that
   genotypes predisposed to be aggressive (due to DGEs) strongly decreased
   aggressiveness in opponents (due to IGEs). As a consequence, the
   variance in total breeding values was reduced to almost zero, implying
   that IGEs indeed greatly contribute to the occurrence of evolutionary
   stasis. IGEs were further associated with genetic variation in a
   non-social behaviour: explorative genotypes elicited most aggression in
   opponents. These key findings imply that IGEs indeed represent an
   important overlooked mechanism that can impact evolutionary dynamics of
   traits under selection.}},

Abstract = {{Studies on the evolution of cooperative behaviour are typically confined
   to understanding its adaptive value. It is equally essential, however,
   to understand its potential to evolve, requiring knowledge about the
   phenotypic consistency and genetic basis of cooperative behaviour. While
   previous observational studies reported considerably high heritabilities
   of helping behaviour in cooperatively breeding vertebrates, experimental
   studies disentangling the relevant genetic and non-genetic components of
   cooperative behaviour are lacking. In a half-sibling breeding
   experiment, we investigated the repeatability and heritability of three
   major helping behaviours performed by subordinates of the cooperatively
   breeding fish Neolamprologus pulcher. To experimentally manipulate the
   amount of help needed in a territory, we raised the fish in two
   environments differing in egg predation risk. All three helping
   behaviours were significantly repeatable, but had very low
   heritabilities. The high within-individual consistencies were
   predominantly due to maternal and permanent environment effects. The
   perceived egg predation risk had no effect on helping, but social
   interactions significantly influenced helping propensities. Our results
   reveal that developmentally plastic adjustments of provided help to
   social context shape cooperative phenotypes, whereas heritable genetic
   variation plays a minor role.}},

Abstract = {{Despite strong purifying or directional selection, variation is
   ubiquitous in populations. One mechanism for the maintenance of
   variation is indirect genetic effects (IGEs), as the fitness of a given
   genotype will depend somewhat on the genes of its social partners. IGEs
   describe the effect of genes in social partners on the expression of the
   phenotype of a focal individual. Here, we ask what effect IGEs, and
   variation in IGEs between abiotic environments, has on locomotion in
   Drosophila. This trait is known to be subject to intralocus sexually
   antagonistic selection. We estimate the coefficient of interaction, ,
   using six inbred lines of Drosophila. We found that varied between
   abiotic environments, and that it may vary across among male genotypes
   in an abiotic environment specific manner. We also found evidence that
   social effects of males alter the value of a sexually dimorphic trait in
   females, highlighting an interesting avenue for future research into
   sexual antagonism. We conclude that IGEs are an important component of
   social and sexual interactions and that they vary between individuals
   and abiotic environments in complex ways, with the potential to promote
   the maintenance of phenotypic variation.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},

Abstract = {{Individuals often interact more closely with some members of the
   population (e.g., offspring, siblings, or group members) than they do
   with other individuals. This structuring of interactions can lead to
   multilevel natural selection, where traits expressed at the group-level
   influence fitness alongside individual-level traits. Such multilevel
   selection can alter evolutionary trajectories, yet is rarely quantified
   in the wild, especially for species that do not interact in clearly
   demarcated groups. We quantified multilevel natural selection on two
   traits, postnatal growth rate and birth date, in a population of North
   American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). The strongest level of
   selection was typically within-acoustic social neighborhoods (within 130
   m of the nest), where growing faster and being born earlier than nearby
   litters was key, while selection on growth rate was also apparent both
   within-litters and within-study areas. Higher population densities
   increased the strength of selection for earlier breeding, but did not
   influence selection on growth rates. Females experienced especially
   strong selection on growth rate at the within-litter level, possibly
   linked to the biased bequeathal of the maternal territory to daughters.
   Our results demonstrate the importance of considering multilevel and
   sex-specific selection in wild species, including those that are
   territorial and sexually monomorphic.}},

Title = {{A model to estimate effects of SNPs on host susceptibility and
   infectivity for an endemic infectious disease}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{49}},
Month = {{JUN 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Infectious diseases in farm animals affect animal health,
   decrease animal welfare and can affect human health. Selection and
   breeding of host individuals with desirable traits regarding infectious
   diseases can help to fight disease transmission, which is affected by
   two types of (genetic) traits: host susceptibility and host infectivity.
   Quantitative genetic studies on infectious diseases generally connect an
   individual's disease status to its own genotype, and therefore capture
   genetic effects on susceptibility only. However, they usually ignore
   variation in exposure to infectious herd mates, which may limit the
   accuracy of estimates of genetic effects on susceptibility. Moreover,
   genetic effects on infectivity will exist as well. Thus, to design
   optimal breeding strategies, it is essential that genetic effects on
   infectivity are quantified. Given the potential importance of genetic
   effects on infectivity, we set out to develop a model to estimate the
   effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on both host
   susceptibility and host infectivity. To evaluate the quality of the
   resulting SNP effect estimates, we simulated an endemic disease in 10
   groups of 100 individuals, and recorded time-series data on individual
   disease status. We quantified bias and precision of the estimates for
   different sizes of SNP effects, and identified the optimum recording
   interval when the number of records is limited.
   Results: We present a generalized linear mixed model to estimate the
   effect of SNPs on both host susceptibility and host infectivity. SNP
   effects were on average slightly underestimated, i. e. estimates were
   conservative. Estimates were less precise for infectivity than for
   susceptibility. Given our sample size, the power to estimate SNP effects
   for susceptibility was 100\% for differences between genotypes of a
   factor 1.56 or more, and was higher than 60\% for infectivity for
   differences between genotypes of a factor 4 or more. When disease status
   was recorded 11 times on each animal, the optimal recording interval was
   25 to 50\% of the average infectious period.
   Conclusions: Our model was able to estimate genetic effects on
   susceptibility and infectivity. In future genomewide association
   studies, it may serve as a starting point to identify genes that affect
   disease transmission and disease prevalence.}},

Abstract = {{The hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been one of the
   primary model systems in biology since the 1970s, but only within the

   experimental evolution with C. elegans and related species, such as C.
   briggsae and C. remanei, by discussing the principles of experimental
   design, and highlighting the strengths and limitations of Caenorhabditis
   as model systems. We then review three exemplars of Caenorhabditis
   experimental evolution studies, underlining representative evolution
   experiments that have addressed the: (1) maintenance of genetic
   variation; (2) role of natural selection during transitions from
   outcrossing to selfing, as well as the maintenance of mixed breeding
   modes during evolution; and (3) evolution of phenotypic plasticity and
   its role in adaptation to variable environments, including host-pathogen

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are abundant, both in natural and
   domestic populations, and may affect phenotypes of individuals. Recent
   research has demonstrated that the social effect of an individual on the
   phenotype of its social partners may have a genetic component, known as
   an indirect genetic effect (IGE). Little is known, however, of
   nongenetic factors underlying such social effects. Early-life
   environments often have large effects on phenotypes of the individuals
   themselves later in life. Offspring development in many mammalian
   species, for example, depends on interactions with the mother and
   siblings. In domestic pigs, individuals sharing the same juvenile
   environment develop similar body weight later in life. We, therefore,
   hypothesized that offspring originating from the same early-life
   environment also develop common social skills that generate early-life
   social effects (ELSEs) that affect the phenotypes of their social
   partners later in life. We, therefore, quantified IGEs and ELSEs on
   growth in domestic pigs. Results show that individuals from the same
   early-life environment express similar social effects on the growth of
   their social partners, and that such ELSEs shape the growth rate of
   social partners more than IGEs. Thus, the social skills that individuals
   develop in early life have a long-lasting impact on the phenotypes of
   social partners. Early-life and genetic social effects were independent
   of the corresponding direct effects of offspring on their own growth,
   indicating that individuals may enhance the growth of their social
   partners without a personal cost. Our findings also illustrate how
   research devoted to quantifying IGEs may miss nongenetic and potentially
   confounded social mechanisms which may bias the estimates of IGEs.}},

Abstract = {{Female mate choice is a complex decision-making process that involves
   many context-dependent factors. In Drosophila melanogaster, a model
   species for the study of sexual selection, indirect genetic effects
   (IGEs) of general social interactions can influence female mate choice
   behaviors, but the potential impacts of IGEs associated with mating
   experiences are poorly understood. Here, we examined whether the IGEs
   associated with a previous mating experience had an effect on subsequent
   female mate choice behaviors and quantified the degree of additive
   genetic variation associated with this effect. Females from 21 different
   genetic backgrounds were housed with males from one of two distinct
   genetic backgrounds for either a short (3 hr) or long (48 hr) exposure
   period and their subsequent mate choice behaviors were scored. We found
   that the genetic identity of a previous mate significantly influenced a
   female's subsequent interest in males and preference of males.
   Additionally, a hemiclonal analysis revealed significant additive
   genetic variation associated with experience-dependent mate choice
   behaviors, indicating a genotype-by-environment interaction for both of
   these parameters. We discuss the significance of these results with
   regard to the evolution of plasticity in female mate choice behaviors
   and the maintenance of variation in harmful male traits.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of an individual's phenotypic traits can be influenced by
   genes expressed in its social partners. Theoretical models predict that
   such indirect genetic effects (IGEs) on reproductive traits should play
   an important role in determining the evolutionary outcome of sexual
   conflict. However, empirical tests of (i) whether reproductive IGEs
   exist, (ii) how they vary among genotypes, and (iii) whether they are
   uniform for different types of reproductive traits are largely lacking.
   We addressed this in a series of experiments in the simultaneously
   hermaphroditic flatworm Macrostomum lignano. We found strong evidence
   for IGEs on both morphological and behavioral reproductive traits.
   Partner genotype had a significant impact on the testis size of focal
   individualsvarying up to 2.4-foldsuggesting that IGEs could mediate
   sexual conflicts that target the male sex function. We also found that
   time to first copulation was affected by a genotype x genotype
   interaction between mating partners, and that partner genotype affected
   the propensity to copulate and perform the postcopulatory suck behavior,
   which may mediate conflicts over the fate of received ejaculate
   components. These findings provide clear empirical evidence for IGEs on
   multiple behavioral and morphological reproductive traits, which
   suggests that the evolutionary dynamics of these traits could be altered
   by genes contained in the social environment.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment modulates gene expression, physiology, behaviour
   and patterns of inheritance. For more than 50 years, this concept has
   been investigated using approaches that include partitioning the social
   component out of behavioural heritability estimates, studying maternal
   effects on offspring, and analysing dominance hierarchies. Recent
   advances have formalized this `social environment effect' by providing a
   more nuanced approach to the study of social influences on behaviour
   while recognizing evolutionary implications. Yet, in most of these
   formulations, the dynamics of social interactions are not accounted for.
   Also, the reciprocity between individual behaviour and group-level
   interactions has been largely ignored. Consistent with evolutionary
   theory, the principles of social interaction are conserved across a
   broad range of taxa. While noting parallels in diverse organisms, this
   review uses Drosophila melanogaster as a case study to revisit what is
   known about social interaction paradigms. We highlight the benefits of
   integrating the history and pattern of interactions among individuals
   for dissecting molecular mechanisms that underlie social modulation of
   behaviour.}},

Volume = {{149}},
Pages = {{181-187}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A large set of Baluchi sheep growth data collected at Abbasabad Sheep
   Breeding Station, Mashhad, Khorasan Razavi, Iran, was used to estimate
   phenotypic and genetic parameters for growth rate from birth to weaning
   (GRa), weaning to six months of age (GRb), and weaning to 12 months of
   age (GRc) and corresponding Kleiber ratios (KRa, KRb, KRc), efficiency
   of growth (EFa, EFb, EFc) and relative growth rate (RGRa, RGRb, RGRc).
   Genetic parameters were estimated by REML procedure fitting a series of
   six univariate animal models including various combinations of maternal
   effects. The most appropriate model for each trait was determined by the
   Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). In addition, a multi-variate
   analysis was done to estimate (co)variance components between traits.
   Estimates of direct heritabilities (h(2)) were, respectively, 0.06, 0.03
   and 0.10 for GRa, GRb, and GRc; 0.06, 0.06, and 0.05 for EFa, EFb and
   EFc; 0.07, 0.04 and 0.06 for KRa, KRb and KRc; and 0.07, 0.05 and 0.05
   for RGRa, RGRb and RGRc. For traits measured in the pre-weaning growth
   phase, maternal genetic effect was significant. The estimates of
   maternal heritability (m(2)) for GRa, KRa, EFa and RGRa were 0.11, 0.11,
   0.04 and 0.04, respectively. Estimates of the additive genetic
   coefficients of variation (CVA) were used as a measure of genetic
   variability and ranged between 1.68\% (RGRa) and 14.67\% (EFb). Genetic
   correlations between traits ranged from -0.81 (EFa-KRc) to 0.94
   (ADGa-KRa) and phenotypic correlations ranged from -0.72 (KRa-EFc) to
   0.99 (GRb-RGRb). Overall, results showed little additive genetic
   variation in growth rate or efficiency related traits of Baluchi sheep,
   indicating little opportunity for genetic improvement of these traits in
   this breed through selection. In addition, significant maternal effects
   on traits related to pre-weaning growth indicated the importance of
   including maternal effects in genetic evaluation of traits measured
   early in life. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   on offspring disease resistance}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1403-1409}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Maternal effects triggered by changes in the environment (e.g.,
   nutrition or crowding) can influence the outcome of offspring-parasite
   interactions, with fitness consequences for the host and parasite.
   Outside of the classic example of antibody transfer in vertebrates,
   proximate mechanisms have been little studied, and thus, the adaptive
   significance of maternal effects on infection is not well resolved. We
   sought to determine why food-stressed mothers give birth to offspring
   that show a low rate of infection when the crustacean Daphnia magna is
   exposed to an orally infective bacterial pathogen. These more-resistant
   offspring are also larger at birth and feed at a lower rate. Thus,
   reduced disease resistance could result from slow-feeding offspring
   ingesting fewer bacterial spores or because their larger size allows for
   greater immune investment. To distinguish between these theories, we
   performed an experiment in which we measured body size, feeding rate,
   and susceptibility, and were able to show that body size is the primary
   mechanism causing altered susceptibility: Larger Daphnia were less
   likely to become infected. Contrary to our predictions, there was also a
   trend that fast-feeding Daphnia were less likely to become infected.
   Thus, our results explain how a maternal environmental effect can alter
   offspring disease resistance (though body size), and highlight the
   potential complexity of relationship between feeding rate and
   susceptibility in a host that encounters a parasite whilst feeding.}},

Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{86-91}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Maternal effects can have significant and long-term consequences on
   offspring behavior and survival, while consistent individual differences
   (i.e., personality) can have profound impacts on individual fitness.
   Thus, both can influence population dynamics. However, the underlying
   mechanisms that determine variation in personality traits are poorly
   understood. Maternal effects are one potential mechanism that may
   explain personality variation. We capitalized on a long-term study of
   yellow-bellied marmots (Marmotaflaviventris) to identify maternal
   effects on juvenile docility. To do so, we partitioned the variance in
   juvenile docility using a quantitative genetic modeling approach to
   isolate potential maternal effects. We also directly tested whether
   maternal stress, measured through fecal glucocorticoid metabolite levels
   during lactation of 82 mothers, was associated with offspring docility.
   Docility scores were estimated for 645 juveniles trapped between 2002
   and 2012. We found an interaction between maternal glucocorticoid levels
   and dam age on juvenile docility. We also found significant maternal,
   litter, permanent environment, and year effects. These results suggest
   that a mother's life history stage interacts with stress to influence
   offspring personality. This early life influence can have long lasting
   effects on an individual's docility throughout life. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Journal = {{PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{703-710}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Parents may alter offspring phenotype depending on the type of
   environment they encounter. Parasitism is a common stressor; therefore,
   maternal reproductive investment could change in response to parasitic
   infection. However, few experiments have investigated the relationship
   between parasitism and maternal investment, whereas earlier field
   studies provided contradictory evidence. We investigated number, sex
   ratio, and growth of offspring in two rodent species, solitary altricial
   Meriones crassus and social precocial Acomys cahirinus, exposed to
   parasitism by fleas Xenopsylla ramesis and Parapulex chephrenis. No
   effect of treatment on litter size or sex ratio of a litter was found in
   either rodent species. Flea parasitism was found to affect pre-weaning
   body mass gain in M. crassus, but not in A. cahirinus pups. Furthermore,
   it appeared that female M. crassus invested resources into their
   offspring differently in dependence of litter size. In small litters
   (1-3 offspring), pups from infested females gained more body mass before
   weaning than pups from uninfested mothers. However, this trend was
   reversed in females with large litters indicating that parasitized
   females have a finite amount of resources with which to provision their
   young. Thus, M. crassus mothers parasitized by fleas seemed to receive
   some sort of external cues (e.g., stress caused by infestation) that
   prompted them to alter offspring provisioning, depending on
   species-specific possibilities and constraints. Therefore, parasites
   could be a mediator of environmentally induced maternal effects and
   offspring provisioning may have adaptive value against parasitism.}},

   (thereby causing among-individual variation or `personality') and
   within-individual variability in behaviour and body weight (thereby
   causing among-individual differences in residual within-individual
   variance or `stability'), using the Southern field cricket Gryllus
   bimaculatus as a model. We further asked whether effects of diet on the
   expression of these variance components were sex-specific.
   Methods: Manipulating both juvenile and adult diet in a full factorial
   design, individuals were put, in each life-stage, on a diet that was
   either relatively high in carbohydrates or relatively high in protein.
   We subsequently measured the expression of multiple behavioural
   (exploration, aggression and mating activity) and morphological traits
   (body weight and lipid mass) during adulthood.
   Results: Dietary history affected both average phenotype and level of
   within-individual variability: males raised as juveniles on high-protein
   diets were heavier, more aggressive, more active during mating, and
   behaviourally less stable, than conspecifics raised on high-carbohydrate
   diets. Females preferred more protein in their diet compared to males,
   and dietary history affected average phenotype and within-individual
   variability in a sex-specific manner: individuals raised on high-protein
   diets were behaviourally less stable in their aggressiveness but this
   effect was only present in males. Diet also influenced individual
   differences in male body weight, but within-individual variance in
   female body weight.
   Discussion: This study thereby provides experimental evidence that
   dietary history explains both heterogeneous residual within-individual
   variance (i.e., individual variation in `behavioural stability') and
   individual differences in average behaviour (i.e., /personality'),
   though dietary effects were notably trait-specific. These findings call
   for future studies integrating proximate and ultimate perspectives on
   the role of diet in the evolution of repeatedly expressed traits, such
   as behaviour and body weight.}},

Abstract = {{The interplay between consistent individual differences in behavior
   (i.e., animal personality) and behavioral plasticity has recently
   attracted increased interest. We used male Australian field crickets
   (Teleogryllus oceanicus) to investigate how dominance status influences
   the consistency and plasticity of different personality traits, namely
   boldness, exploration, and activity, by experimentally manipulating
   dominance status between measuring sessions. We found that dominants
   that became subordinate when socially challenged, shifted their
   behavior, becoming less bold, explorative, and active, whereas
   subordinates that became dominant, became bolder, more explorative, and
   more active. Individuals that experienced no change in dominance status
   did not alter their behavior. Changes in dominance status reduced the
   repeatability of the putative personality traits of exploration and
   activity while not affecting the repeatability of boldness. Moreover,
   changes in dominance status affected the presence of correlations
   between some personality traits, but not others. Finally, calling
   behavior was related to current and future dominance and explorative
   tendencies. We discuss the broader evolutionary and ecological
   implications of our findings and propose that changes in social status
   should be considered when investigating behavioral syndromes and the
   interplay between animal personality and behavioral plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing the impact of the social environment on health and disease is
   challenging. As social effects are in part determined by the genetic
   makeup of social partners, they can be studied from associations between
   genotypes of one individual and phenotype of another (social genetic
   effects, SGE, also called indirect genetic effects). For the first time
   we quantified the contribution of SGE to more than 100 organismal
   phenotypes and genome-wide gene expression measured in laboratory mice.
   We find that genetic variation in cage mates (i.e. SGE) contributes to
   variation in organismal and molecular measures related to anxiety, wound
   healing, immune function, and body weight. Social genetic effects
   explained up to 29\% of phenotypic variance, and for several traits
   their contribution exceeded that of direct genetic effects (effects of
   an individual's genotypes on its own phenotype). Importantly, we show
   that ignoring SGE can severely bias estimates of direct genetic effects
   (heritability). Thus SGE may be an important source of ``missing
   heritability{''} in studies of complex traits in human populations. In
   summary, our study uncovers an important contribution of the social
   environment to phenotypic variation, sets the basis for using SGE to
   dissect social effects, and identifies an opportunity to improve studies
   of direct genetic effects.}},

Title = {{Coadaptation of offspring begging and parental provisioning: A role for
   prenatal maternal effects?}},
Journal = {{HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{129-136}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies on birds have shown that offspring begging and parental
   provisioning covary at the phenotypic level, which is thought to reflect
   genetic correlations. However, prenatal maternal factors, like yolk
   testosterone, may also facilitate parent-offspring coadaptation via
   their effects on offspring begging and development. In fact, maternal
   effects are thought to adjust offspring phenotype to the environmental
   conditions they will experience after birth, which are in turn strongly
   dependent on the levels of parental provisioning. Using cross-fostering
   experiments in canaries, we tested the role of maternal effects on
   parent-offspring coadaptation from two different approaches. First, we
   analyzed whether females deposit yolk testosterone in relation to their
   own or their partner's prospective parental provisioning, measured as
   the rate of parental feeding to foster nestlings. Second, we
   investigated whether females deposit yolk testosterone in relation to
   costs they incurred when raising a previous brood, as this likely
   impinges on their capacity to provide parental care in the near future.
   However, from the results of both experiments we have no evidence that
   canary females deposit yolk testosterone in order to match offspring
   begging to the levels of care they and/or their partners provide. We
   therefore found no evidence that yolk testosterone facilitates
   parent-offspring coadaptation. In addition, our results suggest that the
   functional consequences of yolk testosterone deposition may relate to
   hatching asynchrony since it primarily varied with egg laying order. (C)

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to estimate (co)variance components for
   weights at birth (BW), 30 days (W30d) and 90 days (W90d) of age, as well
   as average daily gain from birth to 30 days (ADG1) and from 30 to 90
   days (ADG2) of Sardi sheep. Records of 3709 lambs that descended from
   1170 dams and 85 sires were collected over a period of 21 years in the
   Kra Kra sheep farm. (Co) variance components and the corresponding
   genetic parameters were estimated under Restricted Maximum Likelihood
   (REML) method by fitting of six different animal models with ignoring or
   including maternal effects including maternal genetic or maternal
   permanent environmental effects. The best model was chosen based on
   Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). Bivariate analysis was performed
   using the most appropriate models obtained in univariate analysis. Age
   of dam, type of birth, sex of lamb and year of birth showed significant
   effects on studied traits, so they were considered as fixed effects in
   analyzing models. Direct heritability estimates for BW, W30d, W90d, ADG1
   and ADG2 were 0.07 +/- 0.02, 0.09 +/- 0.03, 0.05 +/- 0.02, 0.01 +/- 0.01
   and 0.05 +/- 0.02, respectively. Maternal heritability estimates were
   0.13 +/- 0.03 and 0.21 +/- 0.04 for BW and W30d, respectively. These
   results indicate that maternal effects on BW and W30d of Sardi lambs
   need to be considered in any selection programme undertaken in this
   breed. Maternal permanent environmental effects accounted for 11\%, 8\%
   and 8\% of phenotypic variance for W90d, ADG1 and ADG2, respectively.
   The direct genetic correlations between studied traits were positive in
   all cases and ranged from 0.23 for BW-ADG1 to 0.98 for W90d-ADG2. The
   corresponding phenotypic correlations varied from 0.01 for BW-ADG1 to
   0.92 for W30d- ADG1. The maternal additive genetic correlation between
   BW and W30d was 0.66. Also, the environmental correlations among studied
   traits varied from 0.04 for BW-ADG1 to 0.93 for W30d-ADG1. Annual
   genetic gains for direct and maternal additive genetic effects of
   studied traits were close to zero. Thus to realize a genetic progress,
   selection should be based on additive genetic values instead of
   phenotypic characteristics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are a major driver of social evolution,

   individuals. Specifically, we relied on recent work on social behaviour
   in fruit flies to examine whether IGEs cause 12 stimulus flies of
   distinct genotypes to alter social interactions within groups of six
   focal flies. The social behaviour of focals was significantly affected
   by the genotype of the stimulus flies. Focals were closer together when
   grouped with stimulus flies from genotypes that were close together than
   when grouped with stimulus flies from genotypes that were farther apart.
   A mechanism mediating this effect was the encounter rate between focal
   flies, which was lowest when the focal flies were grouped with stimulus
   flies of the more cohesive genotypes. (C) 2016 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Organizational processes during prenatal development can have long-term
   effects on an individual's phenotype. Because these early developmental
   stages are sensitive to environmental influences, mothers are in a
   unique position to alter their offspring's phenotype by differentially
   allocating resources to their developing young. However, such prenatal
   maternal effects are difficult to disentangle from other forms of
   parental care, additive genetic effects, and/or other forms of maternal
   inheritance, hampering our understanding of their evolutionary
   consequences. Here we used divergent selection lines for high and low
   prenatal maternal investment and their reciprocal line crosses in a
   precocial birdthe Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica)to quantify the
   relative importance of genes and prenatal maternal effects in shaping
   offspring phenotype. Maternal but not paternal origin strongly affected
   offspring body size and survival throughout development. Although the
   effects of maternal egg investment faded over time, they were large at
   key life stages. Additionally, there was evidence for other forms of
   maternal inheritance affecting offspring phenotype at later stages of
   development. Our study is among the first to successfully disentangle
   prenatal maternal effects from all other sources of confounding
   variation and highlights the important role of prenatal maternal
   provisioning in shaping offspring traits closely linked to fitness.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment of an animal is an especially interesting
   component of its environment because it can be shaped by both genetic
   and non-genetic variation among social partners. Indirect genetic
   effects (IGEs) are those created when genetic variation in social
   partners contributes to variation in an individual's phenotype; a
   potentially common form of IGE occurs when the expression of a
   behavioral phenotype depends on the particular genotypic combination of
   interacting individuals. Although IGEs can profoundly affect
   individual-and group-level fitness, population dynamics, and even
   community structure, understanding their importance is complicated by
   two inherent challenges: (1) identifying individuals with genetic
   differences in social interactions that can contribute to IGEs and (2)
   characterizing natural social interactions that potentially involve
   IGEs. As a first step toward addressing both these challenges in the
   same system, we investigated social interactions involving genetically
   distinct male color morphs in the poeciliid fish Gambusia holbrooki
   under natural and laboratory conditions. Previous work indicates that
   melanic (M) and silver (S) males differ in social behavior and in how
   conspecifics respond to them, suggesting the potential for IGEs. We used
   a combination of live and video recording of social groups in two
   natural populations and in the laboratory to determine the potential for
   IGEs to contribute to behavioral variation in this species. We found
   that M males had more social partners, and especially more female social
   partners than did S males, in nature and in the laboratory. These
   results suggest that both direct and indirect genetic effects have the
   potential to play a role in the expression and evolution of social
   behavior in G. holbrooki.}},

Title = {{Direct and indirect genetic and fine-scale location effects on breeding
   date in song sparrows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1613-1624}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. Quantifying direct and indirect genetic effects of interacting
   females and males on variation in jointly expressed life-history traits
   is central to predicting microevolutionary dynamics. However, accurately
   estimating sex-specific additive genetic variances in such traits
   remains difficult in wild populations, especially if related individuals
   inhabit similar fine-scale environments.
   2. Breeding date is a key life-history trait that responds to
   environmental phenology and mediates individual and population responses
   to environmental change. However, no studies have estimated female
   (direct) and male (indirect) additive genetic and inbreeding effects on
   breeding date, and estimated the cross-sex genetic correlation, while
   simultaneously accounting for fine-scale environmental effects of
   breeding locations, impeding prediction of microevolutionary dynamics.
   3. We fitted animal models to 38 years of song sparrow (Melospiza
   melodia) phenology and pedigree data to estimate sex-specific additive
   genetic variances in breeding date, and the cross-sex genetic
   correlation, thereby estimating the total additive genetic variance
   while simultaneously estimating sex-specific inbreeding depression. We
   further fitted three forms of spatial animal model to explicitly
   estimate variance in breeding date attributable to breeding location,
   overlap among breeding locations and spatial autocorrelation. We thereby
   quantified fine-scale location variances in breeding date and quantified
   the degree to which estimating such variances affected the estimated
   additive genetic variances.
   4. The non-spatial animal model estimated nonzero female and male
   additive genetic variances in breeding date (sex-specific
   heritabilities: 0.07 and 0.02, respectively) and a strong, positive
   cross-sex genetic correlation (0.99), creating substantial total
   additive genetic variance (0.18). Breeding date varied with female, but
   not male inbreeding coefficient, revealing direct, but not indirect,
   inbreeding depression. All three spatial animal models estimated small
   location variance in breeding date, but because relatedness and breeding
   location were virtually uncorrelated, modelling location variance did
   not alter the estimated additive genetic variances.
   5. Our results show that sex-specific additive genetic effects on
   breeding date can be strongly positively correlated, which would affect
   any predicted rates of microevolutionary change in response to sexually
   antagonistic or congruent selection. Further, we show that inbreeding
   effects on breeding date can also be sex specific and that genetic
   effects can exceed phenotypic variation stemming from fine-scale
   location-based variation within a wild population.}},

Abstract = {{Males of socially monogamous species can increase their siring success
   via within-pair and extra-pair fertilizations. In this study, we focused
   on the different sources of (co)variation between these siring routes,
   and asked how each contributes to total siring success. We quantified
   the fertilization routes to siring success, as well as behaviors that
   have been hypothesized to affect siring success, over a five-year period
   for a wild population of great tits Parus major. We considered siring
   success and its fertilization routes as ``interactive phenotypes{''}
   arising from phenotypic contributions of both members of the social
   pair. We show that siring success is strongly affected by the fecundity
   of the social (female) partner. We also demonstrate that a strong
   positive correlation between extra-pair fertilization success and
   paternity loss likely constrains the evolution of these two routes.
   Moreover, we show that more explorative and aggressive males had less
   extra-pair fertilizations, whereas more explorative females laid larger
   clutches. This study thus demonstrates that (co)variation in siring
   routes is caused by multiple factors not necessarily related to
   characteristics of males. We thereby highlight the importance of
   acknowledging the multilevel structure of male fertilization routes when
   studying the evolution of male mating strategies.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{6460-6472}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We use population genetic models to investigate the cooperative and
   conflicting synergistic fitness effects between genes from the nucleus
   and the mitochondrion. By varying fitness parameters, we examine the
   scope for conflict relative to cooperation among genomes and the utility
   of the gene's eye view analytical approach, which is based on the
   marginal average fitness of specific alleles. Because sexual conflict
   can maintain polymorphism of mitochondrial haplotypes, we can explore
   two types of evolutionary conflict (genomic and sexual) with one
   epistatic model. We find that the nuclear genetic architecture
   (autosomal, X-linked, or Z-linked) and the mating system change the
   regions of parameter space corresponding to the evolution by sexual and
   genomic conflict. For all models, regardless of conflict or cooperation,
   we find that population mean fitness increases monotonically as
   evolution proceeds. Moreover, we find that the process of gene frequency
   change with positive, synergistic fitnesses is self-accelerating, as the
   success of an allele in one genome or in one sex increases the frequency
   of the interacting allele upon which its success depends. This results
   in runaway evolutionary dynamics caused by the positive intergenomic
   associations generated by selection. An inbreeding mating system tends
   to further accelerate these runaway dynamics because it maintains
   favorable host-symbiont or male-female gene combinations. In contrast,
   where conflict predominates, the success of an allele in one genome or
   in one sex diminishes the frequency of the corresponding allele in the
   other, resulting in considerably slower evolutionary dynamics. The rate
   of change of mean fitness is also much faster with positive, synergistic
   fitnesses and much slower where conflict is predominant. Consequently,
   selection rapidly fixes cooperative gene combinations, while leaving
   behind a slowing evolving residue of conflicting gene combinations at
   mutation-selection balance. We discuss how an emphasis on marginal
   fitness averages may obscure the interdependence of allelic fitness
   across genomes, making the evolutionary trajectories appear independent
   of one another when they are not.}},

Abstract = {{A key requirement for social cooperation is the mitigation and/or social
   regulation of aggression towards other group members. Populations of the
   harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus show the alternate social
   phenotypes of queens founding nests alone (haplometrosis) or in groups
   of unrelated yet cooperative individuals (pleometrosis). Pleometrotic
   queens display an associated reduction in aggression. To understand the
   proximate drivers behind this variation, we placed foundresses of the
   two populations into social environments with queens from the same or
   the alternate population, and measured their behaviour and head gene
   expression profiles. A proportion of queens from both populations
   behaved aggressively, but haplometrotic queens were significantly more
   likely to perform aggressive acts, and conflict escalated more
   frequently in pairs of haplometrotic queens. Whole-head RNA sequencing
   revealed variation in gene expression patterns, with the two populations
   showing moderate differentiation in overall transcriptional profile,
   suggesting that genetic differences underlie the two founding
   strategies. The largest detected difference, however, was associated
   with aggression, regardless of queen founding type. Several modules of
   coregulated genes, involved in metabolism, immune system and neuronal
   function, were found to be upregulated in highly aggressive queens.
   Conversely, nonaggressive queens exhibited a striking pattern of
   upregulation in chemosensory genes. Our results highlight that the
   social phenotypes of cooperative vs. solitary nest founding tap into a
   set of gene regulatory networks that seem to govern aggression level. We
   also present a number of highly connected hub genes associated with
   aggression, providing opportunity to further study the genetic
   underpinnings of social conflict and tolerance.}},

Title = {{From facultative to obligatory parental care: Interspecific variation in
   offspring dependency on post-hatching care in burying beetles}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 5}},
Abstract = {{Studies on the evolution of parental care have focused primarily on the
   costs and benefits of parental care and the life-history attributes that
   favour it. However, once care evolves, offspring in some taxa appear to
   become increasingly dependent on their parents. Although offspring
   dependency is a central theme in family life, the evolutionary dynamics
   leading to it are not fully understood. Beetles of the genus Nicrophorus
   are well known for their elaborate biparental care, including
   provisioning of their young. By manipulating the occurrence of pre- or
   post-hatching care, we show that the offspring of three burying beetle
   species, N. orbicollis, N. pustulatus, and N. vespilloides, show
   striking variation in their reliance on parental care. Our results
   demonstrate that this variation within one genus arises through a
   differential dependency of larvae on parental feeding, but not on
   pre-hatching care. In N. pustulatus, larvae appear to be nutritionally
   independent of their parents, but in N. orbicollis, larvae do not
   survive in the absence of parental feeding. We consider evolutionary
   scenarios by which nutritional dependency may have evolved, highlighting
   the role of brood size regulation via infanticide in this genus.}},

Abstract = {{In animal contests, individuals respond plastically to the phenotypes of
   the opponents that they confront. These ``opponent{''}aEuro{''}or
   ``indirect{''}aEuro{''}effects are often repeatable, for example,
   certain opponents consistently elicit more or less aggressiveness in
   others. ``Personality{''} (repeatable among-individual variation in
   behavior) has been proposed as an important source of indirect effects.
   Here, we repeatedly assayed aggressiveness of wild-caught adult male
   field crickets Gryllus campestris in staged dyadic fights, measuring
   aggressiveness of both contestants. Measurements of their personality in
   nonsocial contexts (activity and exploration behavior) enabled us to ask
   whether personality caused indirect effects on aggressiveness. Activity,
   exploration, and aggressiveness were positively associated into a
   behavioral syndrome eliciting aggressiveness in conspecifics, providing
   direct evidence for the role of personality in causing indirect effects.
   Our findings imply that a multivariate view of phenotypes that includes
   indirect effects greatly improves our ability to understand the ecology
   and evolution of behavior.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{1062-1072}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In the past decade, ecologists have begun to more fully appreciate the
   role of evolution in explaining contemporary ecological processes.
   Evolution is most likely to affect ecological patterns when selection
   pressure is particularly strong, or when the generation time of at least
   one interacting species is relatively short. Interactions between plants
   and soil microbes are an excellent candidate for examining eco-evo
   interactions because interactions between organisms are tightly knit
   with the potential for species with relatively short generation times to
   impose strong selection on one another. Here, we examine the potential
   for eco-evolutionary dynamics in plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs). Genetic
   variation in plant traits and subsequent evolution of those traits can
   affect traits and species composition of soil microbial communities.
   Soil microbial communities can, in turn, alter the evolutionary
   trajectory of plant traits. Further, the direction and magnitude of PSFs
   can affect the plant community, which may alter the selection on plant
   traits via intra- and interspecific interactions. Finally, we consider
   how eco-evolutionary feedbacks might enhance or mitigate the effects of
   PSFs in driving the structure of natural plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial symbiont acquisition by hosts may determine the effectiveness
   of the mutualistic relationships. A mix of vertical and horizontal
   transmission may be advantageous for hosts by allowing plastic changes
   of microbial communities depending on environmental conditions.
   Plasticity is well known for gut microbiota but is poorly understood for
   other symbionts of wild animals. We here explore the importance of
   environmental conditions experienced by nestling hoopoes (Upupa epops)
   during the late nesting phase determining microbiota in their uropygial
   gland. In cross-fostering experiments of 8 days old nestlings,
   ``sibling-sibling{''} and ``mother-offspring{''} comparisons were used
   to explore whether the bacterial community naturally established in the
   uropygial gland of nestlings could change depending on experimental
   environmental conditions (i.e., new nest environment). We found that the
   final microbiome of nestlings was mainly explained by nest of origin.
   Moreover, cross-fostered nestlings were more similar to their siblings
   and mothers than to their stepsiblings and stepmothers. We also detected
   a significant effect of nest of rearing, suggesting that nestling
   hoopoes acquire most bacterial symbionts during the first days of life
   but that the microbiome is dynamic and can be modified along the
   nestling period depending on environmental conditions. Estimated effects
   of nest of rearing, but also most of those of nest of origin are
   associated to environmental characteristics of nests, which are extended
   phenotypes of parents. Thus, natural selection may favor the acquisition
   of appropriated microbial symbionts for particular environmental
   conditions found in nests.}},

Abstract = {{Lifetime genetic monogamy, by increasing sibling relatedness, has been

   Monogamy, however, could influence the subsequent evolution of

   exclusive, evolutionary processes that could explain the correlated
   evolution of monogamy and cooperation. Our analysis of these
   possibilities reveals that many ecological or social factors can affect
   all three variables of Hamilton's Rule simultaneously, thus calling for
   a more holistic, systems-level approach to studying the evolution of
   social traits. This perspective reveals novel dimensions to
   coevolutionary relationships and provides solutions for assigning
   causality in complex cases of correlated social trait evolution, such as
   the sequential evolution of monogamy and cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we demonstrate how simulation studies can be used to
   answer questions about identifiability and consequences of omitting
   effects from a model. The methodology is presented through a case study
   where identifiability of genetic and/or individual (environmental)
   maternal effects is explored. Our study system is a wild house sparrow
   (Passer domesticus) population with known pedigree. We fit
   pedigree-based (generalized) linear mixed models (animal models), with
   and without additive genetic and individual maternal effects, and use
   deviance information criterion (DIC) for choosing between these models.
   Pedigree and R-code for simulations are available. For this study
   system, the simulation studies show that only large maternal effects can
   be identified. The genetic maternal effect (and similar for individual
   maternal effect) has to be at least half of the total genetic variance
   to be identified. The consequences of omitting a maternal effect when it
   is present are explored. Our results indicate that the total (genetic
   and individual) variance are accounted for. When an individual
   (environmental) maternal effect is omitted from the model, this only
   influences the estimated (direct) individual (environmental) variance.
   When a genetic maternal effect is omitted from the model, both (direct)
   genetic and (direct) individual variance estimates are overestimated.}},

Volume = {{116}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects are an important force in nature, but the evolutionary
   dynamics of the traits that cause them are not well understood. Egg size
   is known to be a key mediator of prenatal maternal effects with an
   established genetic basis. In contrast to theoretical expectations for
   fitness-related traits, there is a large amount of additive genetic
   variation in egg size observed in natural populations. One possible
   mechanism for the maintenance of this variation is through genetic
   constraints caused by a shared genetic basis among traits. Here we
   created replicated, divergent selection lines for maternal egg
   investment in Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) to quantify the role of
   genetic constraints in the evolution of egg size. We found that egg size
   responds rapidly to selection, accompanied by a strong response in all
   egg components. Initially, we observed a correlated response in body
   size, but this response declined over time, showing that egg size and
   body size can evolve independently. Furthermore, no correlated response
   in fecundity (measured as the proportion of days on which a female laid
   an egg) was observed. However, the response to selection was
   asymmetrical, with egg size plateauing after one generation of selection
   in the high but not the low investment lines. We attribute this pattern
   to the presence of genetic asymmetries, caused by directional dominance
   or unequal allele frequencies. Such asymmetries may contribute to the
   evolutionary stasis in egg size observed in natural populations, despite
   a positive association between egg size and fitness.}},

Abstract = {{This study was carried out to investigate variance components, direct
   heritability, maternal genetic parameters, estimated breeding values
   (EBV) and factors affecting pre-weaning growth criteria of Romney sheep.
   Data were collected over the period from 2006 to 2012 with records of
   4989 lambs descended from 76 rams and 2190 ewes of Romney sheep
   maintained at S. Island of New Zealand via Gene Marker Lab., Faculty of
   Agric. and Life Sci., Lincoln Univ., New Zealand. Results proved that
   genetic and non-genetic factors affecting studied criteria had
   significant effects (P<0.05). Genetic and environmental estimates of
   live body weights at birth (LBW), weaning (LWW) and Kleiber ratio (KR)
   were 0.20 +/- 0.074, 0.15 +/- 0.042 and 0.14 +/- 0.052 for direct
   heritability (h(2)a +/- SE); 0.59 +/- 0.219, 0.41 +/- 0.023 and 0.08 +/-
   0.002 for maternal heritability (h(2)m +/- SE); 0.11684, 2.6378 and
   0.27565 for additive variances (sigma(2)a), 0.34596, 7.1179 and 0.14532
   for maternal variances (sigma(2)m); and 0.002395, 10.1262 and 0.509339
   for permanent environmental variances (sigma(2)e), respectively. EBV's
   of LBW, LWW and KR ranged from -0.555: 0.502, -1.554: 3.006 and -0.633:
   0.242 direct, -0.863: 0.954, -4.942: 2.554 and -0.469: 0.179 maternal
   for rams, respectively; and -0.664: 0.830, -2.996: 4.586 and -1.651:
   0.677 direct, 1.429: 1.142, -7.541: 4.920 and -1.223: 0.492 maternal for
   ewes, respectively. Results suggest the importance of considering the
   non-genetic factors in pre-weaning growth performance of lambs. Moderate
   heritability and positive coefficients of phenotypic and genetic
   correlation for studied criteria indicate to the possibility of
   improving them using traditional selection.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal genetic effects (MGEs), where genes expressed by mothers affect
   the phenotype of their offspring, are important sources of phenotypic
   diversity in a myriad of organisms. We use a single-locus model to
   examine how MGEs contribute patterns of heritable and nonheritable
   variation and influence evolutionary dynamics in randomly mating and
   inbreeding populations. We elucidate the influence of MGEs by examining
   the offspring genotype-phenotype relationship, which determines how MGEs
   affect evolutionary dynamics in response to selection on offspring
   phenotypes. This approach reveals important results that are not
   apparent from classic quantitative genetic treatments of MGEs. We show
   that additive and dominance MGEs make different contributions to
   evolutionary dynamics and patterns of variation, which are
   differentially affected by inbreeding. Dominance MGEs make the offspring
   genotype-phenotype relationship frequency dependent, resulting in the
   appearance of negative frequency-dependent selection, while additive
   MGEs contribute a component of parent-of-origin dependent variation.
   Inbreeding amplifies the contribution of MGEs to the additive genetic
   variance and, therefore enhances their evolutionary response.
   Considering evolutionary dynamics of allele frequency change on an
   adaptive landscape, we show that this landscape differs from the mean
   fitness surface, and therefore, under some condition, fitness peaks can
   exist but not be available to the evolving population.}},

Title = {{Adaptation to Temporally Fluctuating Environments by the Evolution of
   Maternal Effects}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{All organisms live in temporally fluctuating environments. Theory
   predicts that the evolution of deterministic maternal effects (i.e.,
   anticipatory maternal effects or transgenerational phenotypic
   plasticity) underlies adaptation to environments that fluctuate in a
   predictably alternating fashion over maternal-offspring generations. In
   contrast, randomizing maternal effects (i.e., diversifying and
   conservative bet-hedging), are expected to evolve in response to
   unpredictably fluctuating environments. Although maternal effects are
   common, evidence for their adaptive significance is equivocal since they
   can easily evolve as a correlated response to maternal selection and may
   or may not increase the future fitness of offspring. Using the
   hermaphroditic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we here show that the
   experimental evolution of maternal glycogen provisioning underlies
   adaptation to a fluctuating normoxia-anoxia hatching environment by
   increasing embryo survival under anoxia. In strictly alternating
   environments, we found that hermaphrodites evolved the ability to
   increase embryo glycogen provisioning when they experienced normoxia and
   to decrease embryo glycogen provisioning when they experienced anoxia.
   At odds with existing theory, however, populations facing irregularly
   fluctuating normoxia-anoxia hatching environments failed to evolve
   randomizing maternal effects. Instead, adaptation in these populations
   may have occurred through the evolution of fitness effects that
   percolate over multiple generations, as they maintained considerably
   high expected growth rates during experimental evolution despite
   evolving reduced fecundity and reduced embryo survival under one or two
   generations of anoxia. We develop theoretical models that explain why
   adaptation to a wide range of patterns of environmental fluctuations
   hinges on the existence of deterministic maternal effects, and that such
   deterministic maternal effects are more likely to contribute to
   adaptation than randomizing maternal effects.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Climate-driven warming is altering marine ecosystems at an unprecedented
   rate and evolutionary adaptation may represent the last resort for many
   ectothermic organisms to avoid local extinction. The first step to
   elucidate the potential for adaptation to unfavorable thermal conditions
   is to assess the degree of genotype-based variation in thermal reaction
   norms of vital fitness traits. Marine broadcast spawning fishes
   experience extremely high rates of mortality during early life stages.
   Paternally derived (genetic) variation underlying offspring fitness in
   adverse environmental conditions may therefore hold important
   implications for resilience. This study examined how males differ in
   their ability to sire viable offspring and whether the paternal
   contribution modified thermal reaction norms for hatching success in two
   replicated trials with cod Gadus morhua from the Northwest Atlantic
   (trial 1) and Baltic Sea (trial 2). Each trial included five temperature
   treatments (2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0 degrees C in trial 1, and 6.5, 8.0,
   9.5, 11.0, 12.5 degrees C in trial 2) encompassing optimum conditions as
   well as the amount of warming projected in various future pathways for
   the year 2100. In both trials, mean hatching success significantly
   decreased towards thermal extremes. However, half-sibling families
   varied in their response to different incubation temperatures as
   indicated by significant paternity x temperature interactions and
   crossing of reaction norms. The influence of paternity itself was highly
   significant and explained 56\% and 44\% of the observed variation in
   hatching success in trials 1 and 2, respectively. Early embryogenesis
   represented the most crucial developmental period in terms of thermal
   tolerance and paternally mediated variation in hatching success. High
   variation in daily embryo survival among half-sibling families and
   temperature treatments was observed during blastula and gastrulation
   stages (until 100\% epiboly), while almost no mortality occurred during
   subsequent development and throughout the hatching period. The observed
   magnitude of genetic variation underlying thermal reaction norms for
   embryo viability represents a relevant resource for adaptive responses
   (favorable selection) of cod populations exposed to environmental
   variability and/or directional changes, such as ongoing ocean warming.

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are the basis of social interactions
   among conspecifics, and can affect genetic variation of nonsocial and
   social traits. We used flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) of two
   phenotypically distinguishable populations to estimate genetic
   (co)variances and the effect of IGEs on three life-history traits:
   development time (DT), growth rate (GR), and pupal body mass (BM). We
   found that GR was strongly affected by social environment with IGEs
   accounting for 18\% of the heritable variation. We also discovered a
   sex-specific social effect: male ratio in a group significantly affected
   both GR and BM; that is, beetles grew larger and faster in male-biased
   social environments. Such sex-specific IGEs have not previously been
   demonstrated in a nonsocial insect. Our results show that beetles that
   achieve a higher BM do so via a slower GR in response to social
   environment. Existing models of evolution in age-structured or
   stage-structured populations do not account for IGEs of social cohorts.
   It is likely that such IGEs have played a key role in the evolution of
   developmental plasticity shown by Tenebrionid larvae in response to
   density. Our results document an important source of genetic variation
   for GR, often overlooked in life-history theory.}},

Title = {{Theoretical Predictions for Sociogenomic Data: The Effects of Kin
   Selection and Sex-Limited Expression on the Evolution of Social Insect
   Genomes}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Kin selection theory has always been explicitly genetic and has long
   been invoked to explain the evolution of the sterile worker caste in the
   social insects. However, sociogenomic studies of the evolution and
   genomic basis of social insect caste have been largely disconnected from
   kin selection theory and other related genetic theories of social
   evolution. Two previous population genetic models make testable
   predictions for patterns of sequence diversity for genes shaped
   indirectly by kin selection compared to genes shaped directly by natural
   selection, but there is some confusion in the literature regarding the
   predicted effects of kin selection and sex-limited expression on
   molecular evolution. We review the previous models and then use a simple
   parental effect model to clarify that the two factors, kin selection and
   sex-limited expression, are distinct and each has a separate effect on
   the expected patterns of molecular evolution. We further build on the
   previous models to show how categories of genes in social insect genomes
   with diverse combinations of fitness effects (direct, parental, sib, and
   offspring) and patterns of sex-limitation are predicted to evolve. We
   discuss how caste- and sex-specific transcriptomic profiling, coupled
   with population genomic data, can be used to identify different
   functional categories of genes and subsequently test whether observed
   patterns of molecular evolution fit theoretical predictions.}},

Volume = {{282}},

Abstract = {{As individual success often comes at the expense of others, interactions
   between the members of a species are frequently antagonistic, especially
   in the context of reproduction. In theory, this conflict may be reduced
   in magnitude when kin interact, as cooperative behaviour between
   relatives can result in increased inclusive fitness. Recent tests of the
   potential role of cooperative behaviour between brothers in Drosophila
   melanogaster have proved to be both exciting and controversial. We set
   out to replicate these experiments, which have profound implications for
   the study of kin selection and sexual conflict, and to expand upon them
   by also examining the potential role of kinship between males and
   females in reproductive interactions. While we did observe reduced
   fighting and courtship effort between competing brothers, contrary to
   previous studies we did not detect any fitness benefit to females as a
   result of the modification of male antagonistic behaviours. Furthermore,
   we did not observe any differential treatment of females by their
   brothers, as would be expected if the intensity of sexual conflict was
   mediated by kin selection. In the light of these results, we propose an
   alternative explanation for observed differences in male-male conflict
   and provide preliminary empirical support for this hypothesis.}},

Title = {{Genetic parameter estimates for growth and reproductive traits in Lori
   sheep}},
Journal = {{SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{35-42}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Lori sheep is one of the well adapted and relatively heavy breeds in
   mountainous regions of Iran, primarily reared for mutton production. The
   current study was conducted to estimate the (co) variance components and
   genetic parameters by restricted maximum likelihood method using six
   univariate models for growth and four univariate models for reproductive
   traits. Data and pedigree information were collected at Agricultural
   Organization of Lorestan province, west of Iran from 2001 to 2012.
   Studied growth traits were birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW),
   6-month weight (6MW), average daily gain from birth to weaning
   (ADG(0-3)), average daily gain from birth to 6-month (ADG(0-6)), average
   daily gain from weaning to 6-month (ADG(3-6)), and corresponding Kleiber
   ratio (KR0-3, KR0-6, KR3-6). Reproductive traits were litter size at
   birth (LSB), litter size at weaning (LSW), litter mean weight per
   lambing (LMWL), litter mean weight per lamb weaned (LMWLW), total litter
   weight at birth (TLWB) and total litter weight at weaning (TLWW).
   Moreover, multivariate analyses were performed to estimate covariance
   between traits. Direct heritability estimates (h(a)(2)) for growth
   traits ranged from 0.000 (ADG(0-3) and KR0-3) to 0.156 (6MW). Maternal
   heritability (h(m)(2)) decreased from 0.110 at birth to 0.022 at 6-month
   weight. The ratio of maternal permanent environmental variance to
   phenotypic variance (pe(2)) persisted into the post-weaning growth
   period and it was 0.115, 0.080,0.087 and 0.081, for BW,ADG(0-6),KR0-3
   and KR0-6, respectively. Estimates of h(a)(2) for reproductive traits
   were significant for LSB, LSW, LMWL and LMWLW being 0.175, 0.213, 0.088
   and 0.034, respectively, while TLWB and TLWW were more affected by the
   permanent environmental effects of ewes. Service sire effects (S-2) were
   significant for LMWL. Genetic correlations between growth traits ranged
   from -0.425 (BW-KR0-3) to 1.000 (6MW-ADG(0-3), 6MW-KR0-3,
   ADG(0-3)-ADG(3)-ADG(3-6)-KR0-3 and KR0-3-KR0-6), and phenotypic
   correlations ranged from -0.341 (ADG(0-3)-KR3-6) to 0.990
   (6MW-ADG(0-6)). Genetic correlations between reproductive traits were
   higher than phenotypic ones, and ranged from -0.986 (ISB-LMWLW) to 0.999
   (LMWLW-TLWB). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Predicting direct and indirect breeding values for survival time in
   laying hens using repeated measures}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Minimizing bird losses is important in the commercial layer
   industry. Selection against mortality is challenging because
   heritability is low, censoring is high, and individual survival depends
   on social interactions among cage members. With cannibalism, mortality
   depends not only on an individual's own genes (direct genetic effects;
   DGE) but also on genes of its cage mates (indirect genetic effects;
   IGE). To date, studies using DGE-IGE models have focussed on survival
   time but their shortcomings are that censored records were considered as
   exact lengths of life and models assumed that IGE were continuously
   expressed by all cage members even after death. However, since dead
   animals no longer express IGE, IGE should ideally be time-dependent in
   the model. Neglecting censoring and timing of IGE expression may reduce
   accuracy of estimated breeding values (EBV). Thus, our aim was to
   improve prediction of breeding values for survival time in layers that
   present cannibalism.
   Methods: We considered four DGE-IGE models to predict survival time in
   layers. One model was an analysis of survival time and the three others
   treated survival in consecutive months as a repeated binomial trait
   (repeated measures models). We also tested whether EBV were improved by
   including timing of IGE expression in the analyses. Approximate EBV
   accuracies were calculated by cross-validation. The models were fitted
   to survival data on two purebred White Leghorn layer lines W1 and WB,
   each having monthly survival records over 13 months.
   Results: Including the timing of IGE expression in the DGE-IGE model
   reduced EBV accuracy compared to analysing survival time. EBV accuracy
   was higher when repeated measures models were used. However, there was
   no universal best model. Using repeated measures instead of analysing
   survival time increased EBV accuracy by 10 to 21 and 2 to 12 \% for W1
   and WB, respectively. We showed how EBV and variance components
   estimated with repeated measures models can be translated into survival
   time.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that prediction of breeding values for
   survival time in laying hens can be improved using repeated measures
   models. This is an important result since more accurate EBV contribute
   to higher rates of genetic gain.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{367-376}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In recent years, there have been many calls for an extended evolutionary
   synthesis, based in part upon growing evidence for nongenetic mechanisms
   of inheritance, i.e., similarities in phenotype between parents and
   offspring that are not due to shared genes. While there has been an
   impressive marshalling of evidence for diverse forms of nongenetic
   inheritance (epigenetic, ecological, behavioural and symbolic), there
   have been relatively few studies trying to integrate the different forms
   of inheritance into a common conceptual structure, a development that
   would be important to formalize elements of the extended evolutionary
   synthesis. Here, we propose a framework for an extended view of
   inheritance and introduce some conceptual distinctions that we believe,
   are important to this issue. In this framework, the phenotype is
   conceived of as a dynamic entity, its state, at any point in time
   resulting from intertwined effects of previous phenotypic state, and of
   hereditary materials (DNA and otherwise) and environment. We contrast
   our framework with the standard gene-based view of inheritance, and also
   discuss our framework in the specific context of recent attempts to
   accommodate nongenetic inheritance within the framework of classical
   quantitative genetics and the Price equation. In particular, we believe
   that the extended view of inheritance and effects on the phenotype
   developed here is particularly well-suited to individual-based
   simulation studies of evolutionary dynamics. The results of such
   simulations, in turn, could be useful for assessing, how well extended
   models based on quantitative genetics or the Price equation perform at
   capturing complex evolutionary dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Gardner (2015) recently developed a model of a `Genetical Theory of
   Multilevel Selection, which is a thoughtfully developed, but flawed
   model. The model's flaws appear to be symptomatic of common
   misunderstandings of the multi level selection (MLS) literature and the
   recent quantitative genetic literature. I use Gardner's model as a guide
   for highlighting how the MLS literature can address the misconceptions
   found in his model, and the kin selection literature in general. I
   discuss research on the efficacy of group selection, the roll of
   indirect genetic effects in affecting the response to selection and the
   heritability of group-level traits. I also discuss why the Price
   multilevel partition should not be used to partition MLS, and why
   contextual analysis and, by association, direct fitness are appropriate
   for partitioning MLS. Finally, I discuss conceptual issues around
   questions concerning the level at which fitness is measured, the units
   of selection, and I present a brief outline of a model of selection in
   class-structured populations. I argue that the results derived from the
   MLS research tradition can inform kin selection research and models, and
   provide insights that will allow researchers to avoid conceptual flaws
   such as those seen in the Gardner model.}},

Title = {{Estimation of genetic parameters and maternal effects for body weight at
   different ages in D'man sheep}},
Journal = {{SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{27-35}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to estimate the genetic parameters for
   birth weight (BW), weight at 30 days (W30), 90 days (W90) and 135 days
   (W135) of D'man sheep. Records used in the study were collected over a
   period of 25 years (1988-2012) from 4728 lambs that descended from 129
   sires and 621 dams. (Co) variance components and genetic parameters were
   estimated with univariate and bivariate animal models using the
   restricted maximum likelihood (REML) procedure. Age of dam, type of
   birth, sex of lamb and period of birth showed significant effects on
   studied weights, so they were considered as in the analysis models.
   Twelve different animal models were fitted by including or excluding
   maternal additive genetic effects, maternal permanent environmental
   effect, maternal temporary environmental effect and covariance between
   direct-maternal additive genetic effects. The most appropriate model for
   each trait was determined based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC).
   Bivariate analysis was performed using the most appropriate models
   obtained in univariate analysis. Based on the best model, direct
   heritability estimates were 0.05 0.02, 0.03 1 0.02, 0.08 0.03 and 0.12
   0.04 for BW, W30, W90 and W135, respectively. Maternal effects
   significantly influenced the growth traits. The maternal heritability
   for BW, W30 and W90 were 0.10 0.02, 0.07 1 0.03 and 0.07 0.03,
   respectively. Direct-maternal additive genetic correlations were
   negative and medium ranging from -0.04 to -0.54 for BW, W90 and W135,
   but positive and medium to high for W30 (0.25-0.71). The maternal
   permanent environmental effects as a proportion of total variance were
   0.10, 0.05 and 0.09 for W30, W90 and W135, respectively. The maternal
   temporary environmental effects were 0.18, 0.09, 0.08 and 0.07 for BW,
   W30, W90 and W135, respectively. The estimates of direct genetic
   correlation between BW-W30, BW-W90, BW-W135, W30-W90, W30-W135 and
   W90-W135 were 0.841 0.23, 0.66 0.24, 0.81 0.15, 0.921 0.09, 0.93 0.05,
   1.00 0.01, respectively. The estimates of the phenotypic correlation
   among traits were positive and ranged from 0.31 for BW-W135 to 0.87 for
   W90-W135. In conclusion, maternal effects on weights of D'man sheep are
   important and need to be considered in any selection programme
   undertaken for this breed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{282}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypes expressed in a social context are not only a function of the
   individual, but can also be shaped by the phenotypes of social partners.
   These social effects may play a major role in the evolution of
   cooperative breeding if social partners differ in the quality of care
   they provide and if individual carers adjust their effort in relation to
   that of other carers. When applying social effects models to wild study
   systems, it is also important to explore sources of individual
   plasticity that could masquerade as social effects. We studied offspring
   provisioning rates of parents and helpers in a wild population of
   long-tailed tits Aegithalos caudatus using a quantitative genetic
   framework to identify these social effects and partition them into
   genetic, permanent environment and current environment components.
   Controlling for other effects, individuals were consistent in their
   provisioning effort at a given nest, but adjusted their effort based on
   who was in their social group, indicating the presence of social
   effects. However, these social effects differed between years and social
   contexts, indicating a current environment effect, rather than
   indicating a genetic or permanent environment effect. While this study
   reveals the importance of examining environmental and genetic sources of
   social effects, the framework we present is entirely general, enabling a
   greater understanding of potentially important social effects within any
   ecological population.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{1021-1029}},
Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Males adjust both courtship effort and ejaculate expenditure when mating
   with females that are coated in the chemical cues of other males. Using
   a manipulative approach, we show that male flour beetles use the
   chemical cues of rival males left behind on virgin female cuticles to
   assess sperm competition risk. These cues do not make virgin females
   more chemically similar to mated females but appear to allow males to
   indirectly assess competition within the population.Males can gather
   information on the risk and intensity of sperm competition from their
   social environment. Recent studies have implicated chemosensory cues,
   for instance cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) in insects, as a key source
   of this information. Here, using the broad-horned flour beetle ( we
   investigated the importance of contact-derived rival male CHCs in
   informing male perception of sperm competition risk and intensity. We
   experimentally perfumed virgin females with male CHCs via direct
   intersexual contact and measured male pre- and post-copulatory
   investment in response to this manipulation. Using chemical analysis, we
   verified that this treatment engendered changes to perfumed female CHC
   profiles, but did not make perfumed females ``smell{''} mated. Despite
   this, males responded to these chemical changes. Males increased
   courtship effort under low levels of perceived competition (from 1-3
   rivals), but significantly decreased courtship effort as perceived
   competition rose (from 3-5 rivals). Furthermore, our measurement of
   ejaculate investment showed that males allocated significantly more
   sperm to perfumed females than to control females. Together, these
   results suggest that changes in female chemical profile elicited by
   contact with rival males do not provide males with information on female
   mating status, but rather inform males of the presence of rivals within
   the population and thus provide a means for males to indirectly assess
   the risk of sperm competition.}},

Abstract = {{The timing of transition out of one life-history phase determines where
   in the seasonal succession of environments the next phase is spent.
   Shifts in the general environment (e.g., seasonal climate) affect the
   expected fitness for particular transition dates. Variation in
   transition date also leads to temporal variation in the social
   environment. For instance, early transition may confer a competitive
   advantage over later individuals. If so, the social environment will
   impose frequency- and density-dependent selection components. In effect,
   the general environment imposes hard selection, whereas the social
   environment imposes soft selection on phenology. We examined hard and
   soft selection on seedling emergence time in an experiment on Brassica
   rapa. In monoculture (uniform social environment), early emergence
   results in up to a 1.5-fold increase in seed production. In bicultures
   (heterogeneous social environment), early-emerging plants capitalized on
   their head start, suppressing their late neighbors and increasing their
   fitness advantage to as much as 38-fold, depending on density. We
   devised a novel adaptation of contextual analysis to partition total
   selection (i.e., cov(, z)) into the hard and soft components. Hard and
   soft components had similar strengths at low density, whereas soft
   selection was five times stronger than hard at high density.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one
   individual alter the expression of traits in social partners. Previous
   studies focused on the evolutionary consequences and evolutionary
   dynamics of IGEs, using equilibrium solutions to predict phenotypes in
   subsequent generations. However, whether or not such steady states may
   be reached may depend on the dynamics of interactions themselves.
   Results
   In our study, we focus on the dynamics of social interactions and
   indirect genetic effects and investigate how they modify phenotypes over
   time. Unlike previous IGE studies, we do not analyse evolutionary
   dynamics; rather we consider within-individual phenotypic changes, also
   referred to as phenotypic plasticity. We analyse iterative interactions,
   when individuals interact in a series of discontinuous events, and
   investigate the stability of steady state solutions and the dependence
   on model parameters, such as population size, strength, and the nature
   of interactions. We show that for interactions where a feedback loop
   occurs, the possible parameter space of interaction strength is fairly
   limited, affecting the evolutionary consequences of IGEs. We discuss the
   implications of our results for current IGE model predictions and their
   limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation in fitness is required for the adaptive evolution of
   any trait but natural selection is thought to erode genetic variance in
   fitness. This paradox has motivated the search for mechanisms that might
   maintain a population's adaptive potential. Mothers make many
   contributions to the attributes of their developing offspring and these
   maternal effects can influence responses to natural selection if
   maternal effects are themselves heritable. Maternal genetic effects
   (MGEs) on fitness might, therefore, represent an underappreciated source
   of adaptive potential in wild populations. Here we used two decades of
   data from a pedigreed wild population of North American red squirrels to
   show that MGEs on offspring fitness increased the population's
   evolvability by over two orders of magnitude relative to expectations
   from direct genetic effects alone. MGEs are predicted to maintain more
   variation than direct genetic effects in the face of selection, but we
   also found evidence of maternal effect trade-offs. Mothers that raised
   high-fitness offspring in one environment raised low-fitness offspring
   in another environment. Such a fitness trade-off is expected to maintain
   maternal genetic variation in fitness, which provided additional
   capacity for adaptive evolution beyond that provided by direct genetic
   effects on fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Friend of a friend relationships, or the indirect connections between
   people, influence our health, wellbeing, financial success and
   reproductive output. As with humans, social behaviours in other animals
   often occur within a broad interconnected network of social ties. Yet
   studies of animal social behaviour tend to focus on associations between
   pairs of individuals. With the increase in popularity of social network
   analysis, researchers have started to look beyond the dyad to examine
   the role of indirect connections in animal societies. Here, I provide an
   overview of the new knowledge that has been uncovered by these studies.
   I focus on research that has addressed both the causes of social
   behaviours, i.e. the cognitive and genetic basis of indirect
   connections, as well as their consequences, i.e. the impact of indirect
   connections on social cohesion, information transfer, cultural practices
   and fitness. From these studies, it is apparent that indirect
   connections play an important role in animal behaviour, although future
   research is needed to clarify their contribution. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{Parents of many species provision their young, and the extent of
   parental provisioning constitutes a major component of the offspring's
   social environment. Thus, a change in parental provisioning can alter
   selection on offspring, resulting in the coevolution of parental and
   offspring traits. Although this reasoning is central to our evolutionary
   understanding of family life, there is little direct evidence that
   selection by parents causes evolutionary change in their offspring. Here
   we use experimental evolution to examine how populations of burying
   beetles adapt to a change in posthatching parental provisioning. We
   measured the performance of larvae descended from lab populations that
   had been maintained with and without posthatching parental care (Full
   Care and No Care populations). We found that adaptation to the absence
   of posthatching care led to rapid and consistent changes in larval
   survival in the absence of care. Specifically, larvae from No Care
   populations had higher survival in the absence of care than larvae from
   Full Care populations. Other measures of larval performance, such as the
   ability of larvae to consume a breeding carcass and larval mass at
   dispersal, did not differ between the Full Care and No Care populations.
   Nevertheless, our results show that populations can adapt rapidly to a
   change in the extent of parental care and that experimental evolution
   can be used to study such adaptation.}},

   selection analysis reveals fitness consequences of interspecific

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In social species, fitness consequences are associated with both
   individual and social phenotypes. Social selection analysis has
   quantified the contribution of conspecific social traits to individual
   fitness. There has been no attempt, however, to apply a social selection
   approach to quantify the fitness implications of heterospecific social
   phenotypes. Here, we propose a novel social selection based approach
   integrating the role of all social interactions at the community level.
   We extended multilevel selection analysis by including a term accounting
   for the group phenotype of heterospecifics. We analyzed nest activity as
   a model social trait common to two species, the lesser kestrel (Falco
   naumanni) and jackdaw (Corvus monedula), nesting in either single- or
   mixed-species colonies. By recording reproductive outcome as a measure
   of relative fitness, our results reveal an asymmetric system wherein
   only jackdaw breeding performance was affected by the activity
   phenotypes of both conspecific and heterospecific neighbors. Our model
   incorporating heterospecific social phenotypes is applicable to animal
   communities where interacting species share a common social trait, thus
   allowing an assessment of the selection pressure imposed by
   interspecific interactions in nature. Finally, we discuss the potential
   role of ecological limitations accounting for random or preferential
   assortments among interspecific social phenotypes, and the implications
   of such processes to community evolution.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{950-968}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Existing insight suggests that maternal effects have a substantial
   impact on evolution, yet these predictions assume that maternal effects
   themselves are evolutionarily constant. Hence, it is poorly understood
   how natural selection shapes maternal effects in different ecological
   circumstances. To overcome this, the current study derives an
   evolutionary model of maternal effects in a quantitative genetics
   context. In constant environments, we show that maternal effects evolve
   to slight negative values that result in a reduction of the phenotypic
   variance (canalization). By contrast, in populations experiencing abrupt
   change, maternal effects transiently evolve to positive values for many
   generations, facilitating the transmission of beneficial maternal
   phenotypes to offspring. In periodically fluctuating environments,
   maternal effects evolve according to the autocorrelation between
   maternal and offspring environments, favoring positive maternal effects
   when change is slow, and negative maternal effects when change is rapid.
   Generally, the strongest maternal effects occur for traits that
   experience very strong selection and for which plasticity is severely
   constrained. By contrast, for traits experiencing weak selection,
   phenotypic plasticity enhances the evolutionary scope of maternal
   effects, although maternal effects attain much smaller values
   throughout. As weak selection is common, finding substantial maternal
   influences on offspring phenotypes may be more challenging than
   anticipated.}},

Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{602-610}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection acting on small initial differences in mating signals
   and mate preferences can enhance signal-preference codivergence and
   reproductive isolation during speciation. However, the origin of initial
   differences in sexual traits remains unclear. We asked whether biotic
   environments, a source of variation in sexual traits, may provide a
   general solution to this problem. Specifically, we asked whether genetic
   variation in biotic environments provided by host plants can result in
   signal-preference phenotypic covariance in a host-specific,
   plant-feeding insect. We used a member of the Enchenopa binotata species
   complex of treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to assess patterns of
   variation in male mating signals and female mate preferences induced by
   genetic variation in host plants. We employed a novel implementation of
   a quantitative genetics method, rearing field-collected treehoppers on a
   sample of naturally occurring replicated host plant clone lines. We
   found remarkably high signal-preference covariance among host plant
   genotypes. Thus, genetic variation in biotic environments influences the
   sexual phenotypes of organisms living on those environments in a way
   that promotes assortative mating among environments. This consequence
   arises from conditions likely to be common in nature (phenotypic
   plasticity and variation in biotic environments). It therefore offers a
   general answer to how divergent sexual selection may begin.}},

Title = {{A genetic study on sexual dimorphism of bodyweight in sheep}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{101-106}},
Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic basis of
   sexual dimorphism of bodyweight in Zandi sheep. To do this, a pedigree
   including 1450 dams and 170 sires was used. Six bivariate animal models
   were applied for investigating direct and maternal effects for three
   age-specific bodyweights (bodyweight at birth, 3 and 6 months of age) in
   male and female Zandi lambs. The variance components were estimated via
   REML procedure. Males were, respectively, 6\%, 7\% and 9\% heavier than
   females at birth, weaning and 6 months of age. Estimates of sexual
   dimorphism levels (expressed as M/F) were 1.11 at birth, 1.07 at weaning
   and 1.09 at 6 months of age, which indicated relatively low levels of
   sexual size dimorphism in the traits studied. Except for birthweight,
   for which estimates of additive genetic, residual and phenotypic
   variances as well as direct heritability and additive coefficient of
   variation were higher in females, for other traits studied, estimates
   were higher in males. However, regarding direct and maternal effects,
   none of the differences between the sexes was significant, indicating no
   need for sexual selection. Cross-sex genetic correlations were 0.862 at
   birth, 0.918 at weaning and 0.922 at 6 months of age, which highlighted
   birthweight as the most dimorphic trait. It was concluded that, owing to
   possible contribution of sexual chromosomes to variation of
   growth-related traits, bodyweight in male and female lambs may not be
   under the exactly same genetic control.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are heritable effects of an individual
   on phenotypic values of others, and may result from social interactions.
   We determined the behavioural consequences of selection for IGEs for
   growth (IGEg) in pigs in a G x E treatment design. Pigs (n = 480) were
   selected for high versus low IGEg with a contrast of 14 g average daily
   gain and were housed in either barren or straw-enriched pens (n = 80).
   High IGEg pigs showed from 8 to 23 weeks age 40 \% less aggressive
   biting (P = 0.006), 27 \% less ear biting (P = 0.03), and 40 \% less
   biting on enrichment material (P = 0.005). High IGEg pigs had a lower
   tail damage score (high 2.0; low 2.2; P = 0.004), and consumed 30 \%
   less jute sacks (P = 0.002). Selection on high IGEg reduced biting
   behaviours additive to the, generally much larger, effects of
   straw-bedding (P < 0.01), with no G x E interactions. These results show
   opportunities to reduce harmful biting behaviours in pigs.}},

Abstract = {{The social complexity that characterizes the eusocial insects strongly
   affects all aspects of social insect life, including the molecular and
   evolutionary genetic basis of social insect traits. Quantitative genetic
   theory and empirical approaches have been developed over the past 60
   years specifically to study the genetic implications of social
   interactions. Surprisingly, given the obvious biological importance of
   social interactions in social insects, this research tradition has been
   and continues to be widely overlooked throughout the social insect
   literature, including in recent sociogenomic studies focused on
   understanding the molecular underpinnings of social life. Instead, the
   overwhelming majority of social insect genetic research has relied on
   conventional genetic approaches developed for solitary organisms focused
   on the one-to-one association of an individual's genes to its own
   traits. I survey social insect studies that conclusively demonstrate the
   importance of indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which arise from social
   interactions, for social insect trait expression and evolution. I
   explain why these genetically based social effects are expected to be
   ubiquitous in social insects and I explain the relevance of the IGE
   framework, originally developed within quantitative genetics, for
   molecular genetic studies of social insect traits such as behaviour and
   caste. I discuss the problems of ignoring IGEs and relying solely on
   conventional direct genetic effect approaches. Finally, I discuss the
   strong potential of using the IGE approach and other more
   systems-level-focused approaches to complement conventional reductionist
   approaches in elucidating the genetic basis of social insect trait
   expression and evolution.}},

Title = {{Methods to address poultry robustness and welfare issues through
   breeding and associated ethical considerations}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{As consumers and society in general become more aware of ethical and
   moral dilemmas associated with intensive rearing systems, pressure is
   put on the animal and poultry industries to adopt alternative forms of
   housing. This presents challenges especially regarding managing
   competitive social interactions between animals. However, selective
   breeding programs are rapidly advancing, enhanced by both genomics and
   new quantitative genetic theory that offer potential solutions by
   improving adaptation of the bird to existing and proposed production
   environments. The outcomes of adaptation could lead to improvement of
   animal welfare by increasing fitness of the animal for the given
   environments, which might lead to increased contentment and decreased
   distress of birds in those systems. Genomic selection, based on dense
   genetic markers, will allow for more rapid improvement of traits that
   are expensive or difficult to measure, or have a low heritability, such
   as pecking, cannibalism, robustness, mortality, leg score, bone
   strength, disease resistance, and thus has the potential to address many
   poultry welfare concerns. Recently selection programs to include social
   effects, known as associative or indirect genetic effects (IGEs), have
   received much attention. Group, kin, multi-level, and multi-trait
   selection including IGEs have all been shown to be highly effective in
   reducing mortality while increasing productivity of poultry layers and
   reduce or eliminate the need for beak trimming. Multi-level selection
   was shown to increases robustness as indicated by the greater ability of
   birds to cope with stressors. Kin selection has been shown to be easy to
   implement and improve both productivity and animal well-being.
   Management practices and rearing conditions employed for domestic animal
   production will continue to change based on ethical and scientific
   results. However, the animal breeding tools necessary to provide an
   animal that is best adapted to these changing conditions are readily
   available and should be used, which will ultimately lead to the best
   possible outcomes for all impacted.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Social interactions between individuals living in a group can have both
   positive and negative effects on welfare, productivity, and health of
   these individuals. Negative effects of social interactions in livestock
   are easier to observe than positive effects. For example, laying hens
   may develop feather pecking, which can cause mortality due to
   cannibalism, and pigs may develop tail biting or excessive aggression.
   Several studies have shown that social interactions affect the genetic
   variation in a trait. Genetic improvement of socially-affected traits,
   however, has proven to be difficult until relatively recently. The use
   of classical selection methods, like individual selection, may result in
   selection responses opposite to expected, because these methods neglect
   the effect of an individual on its group mates (social genetic effects).
   It has become clear that improvement of socially-affected traits
   requires selection methods that take into account not only the direct
   effect of an individual on its own phenotype but also the social genetic
   effects, also known as indirect genetic effects, of an individual on the
   phenotypes of its group mates. Here, we review the theoretical and
   empirical work on social genetic effects, with a focus on livestock.
   First, we present the theory of social genetic effects. Subsequently, we
   evaluate the evidence for social genetic effects in livestock and other
   species, by reviewing estimates of genetic parameters for direct and
   social genetic effects. Then we describe the results of different
   selection experiments. Finally, we discuss issues concerning the
   implementation of social genetic effects in livestock breeding programs.
   This review demonstrates that selection for socially-affected traits,
   using methods that target both the direct and social genetic effects, is
   a promising, but sometimes difficult to use in practice, tool to
   simultaneously improve production and welfare in livestock.}},

Abstract = {{Forces shaping an individual's phenotype are complex and include
   transgenerational effects. Despite low investment into reproduction, a
   father's environment and phenotype can shape its offspring's phenotype.
   Whether and when such paternal effects are adaptive, however, remains
   elusive. Using three-spined sticklebacks in controlled infection
   experiments, we show that sperm deficiencies in exposed males compared
   to their unexposed brothers functionally translated into reduced
   reproductive success in sperm competition trials. In non-competitive
   fertilisations, offspring of exposed males suffered significant costs of
   reduced hatching success and survival but they reached a higher body
   condition than their counterparts from unexposed fathers after
   experimental infection. Interestingly, those benefits of paternal
   infection did not result from increased resistance but from increased
   tolerance to the parasite. Altogether, these results demonstrate that
   parasite resistance and tolerance are shaped by processes involving both
   genetic and non-genetic inheritance and suggest a context-dependent
   adaptive value of paternal effects.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Together with the avoidance of any negative impact of inbreeding,
   preservation of genetic variability for life-history traits that could
   undergo future selective pressure is a major issue in endangered species
   management programmes. However, most of these programmes ignore that,
   apart from the direct action of genes on such traits, parents, as
   contributors of offspring environment, can influence offspring
   performance through indirect parental effects (when parental genotype
   and phenotype exerts environmental influences on offspring phenotype
   independently of additive genetic effects). Using quantitative genetic
   models, we estimated the additive genetic variance for juvenile survival
   in a population of the endangered Cuvier's gazelle kept in captivity
   since 1975. The dataset analyzed included performance recording for 700
   calves and a total pedigree of 740 individuals. Results indicated that
   in this population juvenile survival harbors significant additive
   genetic variance. The estimates of heritability obtained were in general
   moderate (0.115-0.457) and not affected by the inclusion of inbreeding
   in the models. Maternal genetic contribution to juvenile survival seems
   to be of major importance in this gazelle's population as well. Indirect
   genetic and indirect environmental effects assigned to mothers (i.e.,
   maternal genetic and maternal permanent environmental effects) roughly
   explain a quarter of the total variance estimated for the trait
   analyzed. These findings have major evolutionary consequences for the
   species as show that offspring phenotypes can evolve strictly through
   changes in the environment provided by mothers. They are also relevant
   for the captive breeding programme of the species. To take into account,
   the contribution that mothers have on offspring phenotype through
   indirect genetic effects when designing pairing strategies might serve
   to identify those females with better ability to recruit, and,
   additionally, to predict reliable responses to selection in the captive
   population.}},

Title = {{Selection Based on Indirect Genetic Effects for Growth, Environmental
   Enrichment and Coping Style Affect the Immune Status of Pigs}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{Pigs living in intensive husbandry systems may experience both acute and
   chronic stress through standard management procedures and limitations in
   their physical and social environment, which may have implications for
   their immune status. Here, the effect of a new breeding method where
   pigs were selected on their heritable influence on their pen mates'
   growth, and environmental enrichment on the immune status of pigs was
   investigated. Hereto, 240 pigs with a relatively positive genetic effect
   on the growth of their pen mates (+SBV) and 240 pigs with a relatively
   negative genetic effect on the growth of their pen mates (-SBV) were
   housed in barren or straw-enriched pens from 4 to 23 weeks of age (n =
   80 pens in total). A blood sample was taken from the pigs before, three
   days after a 24 h regrouping test, and at week 22. In addition, effects
   of coping style, as assessed in a backtest, and gender were also
   investigated. Mainly, +SBV were found to have lower leukocyte,
   lymphocyte and haptoglobin concentrations than -SBV pigs. Enriched
   housed pigs had a lower neutrophil to lymphocyte (N:L) ratio and lower
   haptoglobin concentrations, but had higher antibody titers specific for
   Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) than barren housed pigs. No interactions
   were found between SBV class and housing. Furthermore, pigs with a
   proactive coping style had higher alternative complement activity and,
   in the enriched pens, higher antibody titers specific for KLH than pigs
   with a reactive coping style. Lastly, females tended to have lower
   leukocyte, but higher haptoglobin concentrations than castrated males.
   Overall, these results suggest that +SBV pigs and enriched housed pigs
   were less affected by stress than -SBV and barren housed pigs,
   respectively. Moreover, immune activation might be differently organized
   in individuals with different coping styles and to a lesser extent in
   individuals of opposite genders.}},

Abstract = {{Populations evolve in response to the external environment, whether
   abiotic (e. g., climate) or biotic (e. g., other conspecifics). We
   investigated how adaptation to biotic, heritable environments differs
   from adaptation to abiotic, nonheritable environments. We found that,
   for the same selection coefficients, the coadaptive process between
   genes and heritable environments is much faster than genetic adaptation
   to an abiotic nonheritable environment. The increased rate of adaptation
   results from the positive association generated by reciprocal selection
   between the heritable environment and the genes responding to it. These
   associations result in a runaway process of adaptive coevolution, even
   when the genes creating the heritable environment and genes responding
   to the heritable environment are unlinked. Although tightening the
   degree of linkage accelerates the coadaptive process, the acceleration
   caused by a comparable amount of inbreeding is greater, because
   inbreeding has a cumulative effect on reducing functional recombination
   over generations. Our results suggest that that adaptation to local
   abiotic environmental variation may result in the rapid diversification
   of populations and subsequent reproductive isolation not directly but
   rather via its effects on heritable environments and the genes
   responding to them.}},

Abstract = {{Many species spend their lives in close association with other
   organisms, and the environments provided by those organisms can play an
   important role as causes of variation in phenotypes. When this is the
   case, the genotypes of the individuals constituting the environment may
   influence the phenotypes of individuals living in that environment. When
   these effects are between heterospecifics, interspecific indirect
   genetic effects (IIGEs) occur. Several studies have detected IIGEs, but
   whether IIGEs contribute to variation in sexually selected traits
   remains virtually unexplored. We assessed how mate preferences in a
   plant-feeding insect are influenced by the genotype of their host plant.
   We established clone lines of a sample of host plant genotypes
   constituting the background biotic environment for a random sample of
   insects that we reared on them. We found that the insects' mate
   preferences varied according to the clone line on which they developed.
   These results demonstrate that genetic variation in host plants has
   cross-trophic consequences on a trait that has strong effects on fitness
   and interpopulation dynamics such as diversification in communication
   systems. We discuss how IIGEs on mate preferences may influence the way
   in which selection acts, including the maintenance of variation and the
   promotion of evolutionary divergence.}},

Journal = {{HEREDITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{364-374}},

Abstract = {{Infectious diseases have a major role in evolution by natural selection
   and pose a worldwide concern in livestock. Understanding quantitative
   genetics of infectious diseases, therefore, is essential both for
   understanding the consequences of natural selection and for designing
   artificial selection schemes in agriculture. The basic reproduction
   ratio, R-0, is the key parameter determining risk and severity of
   infectious diseases. Genetic improvement for control of infectious
   diseases in host populations should therefore aim at reducing R-0. This
   requires definitions of breeding value and heritable variation for R-0,
   and understanding of mechanisms determining response to selection. This
   is challenging, as R-0 is an emergent trait arising from interactions
   among individuals in the population. Here we show how to define breeding
   value and heritable variation for R-0 for genetically heterogeneous host
   populations. Furthermore, we identify mechanisms determining utilization
   of heritable variation for R-0. Using indirect genetic effects,
   next-generation matrices and a SIR (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered)
   model, we show that an individual's breeding value for R-0 is a function
   of its own allele frequencies for susceptibility and infectivity and of
   population average susceptibility and infectivity. When interacting
   individuals are unrelated, selection for individual disease status
   captures heritable variation in susceptibility only, yielding limited
   response in R-0. With related individuals, however, there is a secondary
   selection process, which also captures heritable variation in
   infectivity and additional variation in susceptibility, yielding
   substantially greater response. This shows that genetic variation in
   susceptibility represents an indirect genetic effect. As a consequence,
   response in R-0 increased substantially when interacting individuals
   were genetically related.}},

Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{Recent years have seen increasing interest in indirect genetic effects,
   i.e. influences on the phenotype that depend on the genotype of other
   conspecific individuals; however, the empirical evidence for such
   effects is still limited, especially in wild plant species. The present
   study of the clonal herb Sedum album assessed direct and indirect
   genetic effects on performance-related traits in a 4-year experiment
   with clonally replicated genotypes, grown in pairs and differing in
   anthocyanin pigmentation to allow separation of individuals during data
   collection. In agreement with the existence of indirect genetic effects,
   the experimentally-paired plants not only expressed their own genotype
   but were also affected by the genotype of their pair mate. The effect of
   neighbour genotype explained up to one-fourth of the variation in
   performance and most likely resulted from competition, imposed by the
   close physical contact between paired individuals and the limiting
   conditions used in the garden environment. Indirect genetic effects from
   competition have the potential to enhance the efficacy of group-level
   selection relative to individual selection, given the nutrient-poor and
   spatially-confined substrate available to plants of S. album in the

Title = {{Indirect genetic effects underlie oxygen-limited thermal tolerance
   within a coastal population of chinook salmon}},
Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{281}},
Number = {{1789}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{With global temperatures projected to surpass the limits of thermal
   tolerance for many species, evaluating the heritable variation
   underlying thermal tolerance is critical for understanding the potential
   for adaptation to climate change. We examined the evolutionary potential
   of thermal tolerance within a population of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus
   tshawytscha) by conducting a full-factorial breeding design and
   measuring the thermal performance of cardiac function and the critical
   thermal maximum (CTmax) of offspring from each family. Additive genetic
   variation in offspring phenotypewas mostly negligible, although these
   direct genetic effects explained 53\% of the variation in resting heart
   rate (f(H)). Conversely, maternal effects had a significant influence on
   resting f(H), scope for f(H), cardiac arrhythmia temperature and CTmax.
   These maternal effects were associated with egg size, as indicated by
   strong relationships between the mean egg diameter of mothers and
   offspring thermal tolerance. Because egg size can be highly heritable in

Abstract = {{Parenting behaviors, such as the provisioning of food by parents to
   offspring, are known to be highly responsive to changes in environment.
   However, we currently know little about how such flexibility affects the
   ways in which parenting is adapted and evolves in response to
   environmental variation. This is because few studies quantify how
   individuals vary in their response to changing environments, especially
   social environments created by other individuals with which parents
   interact. Social environmental factors differ from nonsocial factors,
   such as food availability, because parents and offspring both contribute
   and respond to the social environment they experience. This
   interdependence leads to the coevolution of flexible behaviors involved
   in parenting, which could, paradoxically, constrain the ability of
   individuals to rapidly adapt to changes in their nonsocial environment.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal capacity is a key life-history trait especially in species
   inhabiting fragmented landscapes. Evolutionary models predict that,
   given sufficient heritable variation, dispersal rate responds to natural
   selection imposed by habitat loss and fragmentation. Here, we estimate
   phenotypic variance components and heritability of flight and resting
   metabolic rates (RMRs) in an ecological model species, the Glanville
   fritillary butterfly, in which flight metabolic rate (FMR) is known to
   correlate strongly with dispersal rate. We modelled a two-generation
   pedigree with the animal model to distinguish additive genetic variance
   from maternal and common environmental effects. The results show that
   FMR is significantly heritable, with additive genetic variance
   accounting for about 40\% of total phenotypic variance; thus, FMR has
   the potential to respond to selection on dispersal capacity. Maternal
   influences on flight metabolism were negligible. Heritability of flight
   metabolism was context dependent, as in stressful thermal conditions,
   environmentally induced variation dominated over additive genetic
   effects. There was no heritability in RMR, which was instead strongly
   influenced by maternal effects. This study contributes to a mechanistic
   understanding of the evolution of dispersal-related traits, a pressing
   question in view of the challenges posed to many species by changing
   climate and fragmentation of natural habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The fitness consequences of extreme competitive interactions such as
   cannibalism are often governed by the environment because the costs and
   benefits of such behaviors depend on the ecological and social context
   of the participants. However, most studies of context-dependent
   cannibalism are conducted under extreme circumstances or examine only a
   single environmental context, conditions that are unlikely to exist in
   natural populations. In this study, we tested the effect of multiple
   environmental contexts on the frequency of cannibalism in forked fungus
   beetle larvae (Bolitotherus cornutus), which develop in 1 of 3 different
   fungus species. We paired larvae in laboratory trials and measured the
   effect of 1) ecological context (the 3 fungi) and 2) the relatedness of
   the paired larvae on the frequency of cannibalism. We found a strong
   effect of ecological context on cannibalism: larvae in 1 fungus
   cannibalized nearly twice as often as larvae in the other two. We did
   not detect an effect of relatedness on cannibalism in the 1 species of
   fungus in which trials were conducted. Cannibalism conferred benefits in
   the form of accelerated growth rates in all measured traits relative to
   noncannibals. However, contrary to most studies, cannibalism was most
   common in the highest quality fungus, contradicting the hypothesis that
   cannibalism occurs in poor environments to compensate for resource
   deficiencies. We discuss alternative mechanisms that may drive the
   ecological context dependence of cannibalism in B. cornutus and
   emphasize the importance of studying context-dependent behavior in
   naturally occurring environments.}},

Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1871-1882}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one
   individual alter the phenotype of an interacting partner. IGEs can
   dramatically affect the expression and evolution of social traits.
   However, the interacting phenotype(s) through which they are transmitted
   are often unknown, or cryptic, and their detection would enhance our
   ability to accurately predict evolutionary change. To illustrate this
   challenge and possible solutions to it, we assayed male leg-tapping
   behavior using inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster paired with a
   common focal male strain. The expression of tapping in focal males was
   dependent on the genotype of their interacting partner, but this strong
   IGE was cryptic. Using a multiple-regression approach, we identified
   male startle response as a candidate interacting phenotype: the longer
   it took interacting males to settle after being startled, the less focal
   males tapped them. A genome-wide association analysis identified
   approximately a dozen candidate protein-coding genes potentially
   underlying the IGE, of which the most significant was slowpoke. Our
   methodological framework provides information about candidate phenotypes
   and candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms that underpin a strong yet
   cryptic IGE. We discuss how this approach can facilitate the detection
   of cryptic IGEs contributing to unusual evolutionary dynamics in other
   study systems.}},

Title = {{Indirect genetic effects and inbreeding: consequences of BLUP selection
   for socially affected traits on rate of inbreeding}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Social interactions often occur among living organisms,
   including aquatic animals. There is empirical evidence showing that
   social interactions may genetically affect phenotypes of individuals and
   their group mates. In this context, the heritable effect of an
   individual on the phenotype of another individual is known as an
   Indirect Genetic Effect (IGE). Selection for socially affected traits
   may increase response to artificial selection, but also affect rate of
   inbreeding.
   Methods: A simulation study was conducted to examine the effect of Best
   Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) selection for socially affected traits
   on the rate of inbreeding. A base scenario without IGE and three
   alternative scenarios with different magnitudes of IGE were simulated.
   In each generation, 25 sires and 50 dams were mated, producing eight
   progeny per dam. The population was selected for 20 generations using
   BLUP. Individuals were randomly assigned to groups of eight members in
   each generation, with two families per group, each contributing four
   individuals. ``Heritabilities{''} (for both direct and indirect genetic
   effects) were equal to 0.1, 0.3 or 0.5, and direct-indirect genetic
   correlations were -0.8, -0.4, 0, 0.4, or 0.8. The rate of inbreeding was
   calculated from generation 10 to 20.
   Results: For the base scenario, the rates of inbreeding were 4.09, 2.80
   and 1.95\% for ``heritabilities{''} of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5, respectively.
   Overall, rates of inbreeding for the three scenarios with IGE ranged
   from 2.21 to 5.76\% and were greater than for the base scenarios. The
   results show that social interaction within groups of two families
   increases the resemblance between estimated breeding values of
   relatives, which, in turn, increases the rate of inbreeding.
   Conclusion: BLUP selection for socially affected traits increased the
   rate of inbreeding. To maintain inbreeding at an acceptable rate, a
   selection algorithm that restricts the increase in mean kinship, such as
   optimum contribution selection, is required.}},

Abstract = {{Tolerance to competition has been hypothesized to reduce the negative
   impact of plant-plant competition on fitness. Although competitive
   interactions are a strong selective force, an analysis of net selection
   on tolerance to competition is absent in the literature. Using 55
   full/half-sibling families from 18 maternal lines in the crop weed
   Ipomoea purpurea, we measured fitness and putative tolerance traits when
   grown with and without competition in an agricultural field. We tested
   for the presence of genetic variation for tolerance to competition and
   determined if there were costs and benefits of this trait. We also
   assessed correlations between tolerance and potential tolerance traits.
   We uncovered a fitness benefit of tolerance in the presence of
   competition and a cost in its absence. We failed to detect evidence of
   additive genetic variation underlying tolerance, but did uncover the
   presence of a significant maternal-line effect for tolerance, which
   suggests its evolutionary trajectory is not easily predicted. The cost
   of tolerance is likely due to later initiation of flowering of tolerant
   individuals in the absence of competition, whereas relative growth rate
   was found to positively covary with tolerance in the presence of
   competition, and can thus be considered a tolerance trait.}},

   either elevated polyandry or enforced monandry. Gene expression
   evolution following mating system manipulation resulted in 14\% of the
   transcriptome of virgin females being altered. Polyandrous females
   elevated expression of a greater number of genes normally enriched in
   ovaries and associated with mitosis and meiosis, which might reflect
   female investment into reproductive functions. Monandrous females showed
   a greater number of genes normally enriched for expression in somatic
   tissues, including the head and gut and associated with visual
   perception and metabolism, respectively. By comparing our data with a
   previous study of sex differences in gene expression in this species, we
   found that the majority of the genes that are differentially expressed
   between females of the selection treatments show female-biased
   expression in the wild-type population. A striking exception is genes
   associated with male-specific reproductive tissues (in D.melanogaster),
   which are upregulated in polyandrous females. Our results provide
   experimental evidence for a role of sex-specific selection arising from
   differing sexual interactions with males in promoting rapid evolution of
   the female transcriptome.}},

Title = {{Plumage condition in laying hens: genetic parameters for direct and
   indirect effects in two purebred layer lines}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Feather pecking is a major welfare issue in laying hen
   industry that leads to mortality. Due to a ban on conventional cages in
   the EU and on beak trimming in some countries of the EU, feather pecking
   will become an even bigger problem. Its severity depends both on the
   victim receiving pecking and on its group mates inflicting pecking
   (indirect effects), which together determine plumage condition of the
   victim. Plumage condition may depend, therefore, on both the direct
   genetic effect of an individual itself and on the indirect genetic
   effects of its group mates. Here, we present estimated genetic
   parameters for direct and indirect effects on plumage condition of
   different body regions in two purebred layer lines, and estimates of
   genetic correlations between body regions.
   Methods: Feather condition scores (FCS) were recorded at 40 weeks of age
   for neck, back, rump and belly and these four scores were added-up into
   a total FCS. A classical animal model and a direct-indirect effects
   model were used to estimate genetic parameters for FCS. In addition, a
   bivariate model with mortality (0/ 1) was used to account for mortality
   before recording FCS. Due to mortality during the first 23 weeks of
   laying, 5363 (for W1) and 5089 (for WB) FCS records were available.
   Results: Total heritable variance for FCS ranged from 1.5\% to 9.8\% and
   from 9.8\% to 53.6\% when estimated respectively with the classical
   animal and the direct-indirect effects model. The direct-indirect
   effects model had a significantly higher likelihood. In both lines, 70\%
   to 94\% of the estimated total heritable variation in FCS was due to
   indirect effects. Using bivariate analysis of FCS and mortality did not
   affect estimates of genetic parameters. Genetic correlations were high
   between adjacent regions for FCS on neck, back, and rump but moderate to
   low for belly with other regions.
   Conclusion: Our results show that 70\% to 94\% of the heritable
   variation in FCS relates to indirect effects, indicating that methods of
   genetic selection that include indirect genetic effects offer
   perspectives to improve plumage condition in laying hens. This, in turn
   could reduce a major welfare problem.}},

Abstract = {{We survey the population genetic basis of social evolution, using a
   logically consistent set of arguments to cover a wide range of
   biological scenarios. We start by reconsidering Hamilton's (Hamilton
   1964 J. Theoret. Biol. 7, 1-16 (doi: 10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4))
   results for selection on a social trait under the assumptions of
   additive gene action, weak selection and constant environment and
   demography. This yields a prediction for the direction of allele
   frequency change in terms of phenotypic costs and benefits and
   genealogical concepts of relatedness, which holds for any frequency of
   the trait in the population, and provides the foundation for further
   developments and extensions. We then allow for any type of gene
   interaction within and between individuals, strong selection and
   fluctuating environments and demography, which may depend on the
   evolving trait itself. We reach three conclusions pertaining to
   selection on social behaviours under broad conditions. (i) Selection can
   be understood by focusing on a one-generation change in mean allele
   frequency, a computation which underpins the utility of reproductive
   value weights; (ii) in large populations under the assumptions of
   additive gene action and weak selection, this change is of constant sign
   for any allele frequency and is predicted by a phenotypic selection
   gradient; (iii) under the assumptions of trait substitution sequences,
   such phenotypic selection gradients suffice to characterize long-term
   multidimensional stochastic evolution, with almost no knowledge about
   the genetic details underlying the coevolving traits. Having such simple
   results about the effect of selection regardless of population structure
   and type of social interactions can help to delineate the common
   features of distinct biological processes. Finally, we clarify some
   persistent divergences within social evolution theory, with respect to
   exactness, synergies, maximization, dynamic sufficiency and the role of
   genetic arguments.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple organisms can sometimes affect a common phenotype. For example,
   the portion of a leaf eaten by an insect is a joint phenotype of the
   plant and insect and the amount of food obtained by an offspring can be
   a joint trait with its mother. Here, I describe the evolution of joint
   phenotypes in quantitative genetic terms. A joint phenotype for multiple
   species evolves as the sum of additive genetic variances in each
   species, weighted by the selection on each species. Selective conflict
   between the interactants occurs when selection takes opposite signs on
   the joint phenotype. The mean fitness of a population changes not just
   through its own genetic variance but also through the genetic variance
   for its fitness that resides in other species, an update of Fisher's
   fundamental theorem of natural selection. Some similar results, using
   inclusive fitness, apply to within-species interactions. The models
   provide a framework for understanding evolutionary conflicts at all

Abstract = {{Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness revolutionized our understanding
   of the evolution of social interactions. Surprisingly, an incorporation
   of Hamilton's perspective into the quantitative genetic theory of
   phenotypic evolution has been slow, despite the popularity of
   quantitative genetics in evolutionary studies. Here, we discuss several
   versions of Hamilton's rule for social evolution from a quantitative
   genetic perspective, emphasizing its utility in empirical applications.
   Although evolutionary quantitative genetics offers methods to measure
   each of the critical parameters of Hamilton's rule, empirical work has
   lagged behind theory. In particular, we lack studies of selection on
   altruistic traits in the wild. Fitness costs and benefits of altruism
   can be estimated using a simple extension of phenotypic selection
   analysis that incorporates the traits of social interactants. We also
   discuss the importance of considering the genetic influence of the
   social environment, or indirect genetic effects (IGEs), in the context
   of Hamilton's rule. Research in social evolution has generated an
   extensive body of empirical work focusing-with good reason-almost solely
   on relatedness. We argue that quantifying the roles of social and
   non-social components of selection and IGEs, in addition to relatedness,
   is now timely and should provide unique additional insights into social
   evolution.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Volume = {{91}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects are powerful forces of adaptive evolution but their
   widespread implications, especially in human-disturbed environments, are
   still being realized. Here we examine the role of maternal effects in
   shaping fitness-related behaviour and life-history traits in black widow
   spiders, Latrodectus hesperus. We test the prediction that adult
   foraging success shapes maternal body condition, fecundity and egg
   investment, and that maternal prey abundance has a positive,
   cross-generational effect on a number of important offspring traits. Our
   results suggest that maternal foraging success is indeed translated into
   positive effects on maternal body condition, eggsac mass, egg number,
   egg mass, egg size, egg density and development rate. Maternal feeding
   had no effect on sibling cannibalism. Interestingly, despite the
   statistically significant effects of maternal food regime on offspring
   parameters listed above, some mothers in the high-food treatment
   nevertheless made low-density eggs and some mothers in the low-food
   treatment made high-density eggs. Thus, maternal egg investment, and
   several other life-history variables, were influenced by a family effect
   that cannot be explained solely by our manipulation of maternal
   foraging. For example, a strong effect of family on the latency to
   sibling cannibalism, in the absence of any link between maternal food
   regime, egg density and cannibalism, suggests that direct genetic
   effects, rather than maternal effects, may explain this fitness-related
   behavioural trait. We discuss the implications of these findings for our
   understanding of the behaviour, ecology and evolution of this and other
   arthropods, with particular reference to the possibility that maternal
   effects may facilitate rapid evolution to human-disturbed habitats. (C)

Title = {{The Evolution of Multivariate Maternal Effects}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in predicting the social and ecological
   contexts that favor the evolution of maternal effects. Most predictions
   focus, however, on maternal effects that affect only a single character,
   whereas the evolution of maternal effects is poorly understood in the
   presence of suites of interacting traits. To overcome this, we simulate
   the evolution of multivariate maternal effects (captured by the matrix
   M) in a fluctuating environment. We find that the rate of environmental
   fluctuations has a substantial effect on the properties of M: in slowly
   changing environments, offspring are selected to have a multivariate
   phenotype roughly similar to the maternal phenotype, so that M is
   characterized by positive dominant eigenvalues; by contrast, rapidly
   changing environments favor Ms with dominant eigenvalues that are
   negative, as offspring favor a phenotype which substantially differs
   from the maternal phenotype. Moreover, when fluctuating selection on one
   maternal character is temporally delayed relative to selection on other
   traits, we find a striking pattern of cross-trait maternal effects in
   which maternal characters influence not only the same character in
   offspring, but also other offspring characters. Additionally, when
   selection on one character contains more stochastic noise relative to
   selection on other traits, large cross-trait maternal effects evolve
   from those maternal traits that experience the smallest amounts of
   noise. The presence of these cross-trait maternal effects shows that
   individual maternal effects cannot be studied in isolation, and that
   their study in a multivariate context may provide important insights
   about the nature of past selection. Our results call for more studies
   that measure multivariate maternal effects in wild populations.}},

Title = {{Modelling of feather pecking behavior in beak-trimmed and

Volume = {{93}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Because of a ban on the use of beak trimming in some European countries,
   feather pecking is becoming a substantial problem in the layer industry,
   both from animal welfare and economic points of view. The feather
   condition score (FCS) as a measure of feather damage has been shown to
   be closely related to feather pecking behavior in laying hens housed in
   groups. To obtain a better understanding of genetic and other biological
   mechanisms underlying feather pecking behavior, data on FCS of a
   population of 2,724 female offspring from crossing 50 male W1 and 907
   female WB purebred lines were used. The offspring of 25 sires were
   beak-trimmed, and the offspring of another 25 sires were
   non-beak-trimmed. Titers of plasma natural antibody (NAb) isotypes IgM
   and IgG binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin at 24 wk of age were measured.
   Feather condition was scored at 53 wk of age. In the first part of the
   present study, we estimated genetic parameters for FCS with 2 variance
   components models: a traditional linear animal model and a model
   combining direct and associative genetic effects. In the second part of
   the present study, a trait-based analysis for FCS was conducted to
   investigate whether NAb isotype titers can explain variation in FCS
   among individuals, by fitting a linear mixed model. Though the estimated
   associative genetic variance was substantial, associative effects for
   FCS were not statistically significant in both populations (P = 0.09 in
   beak-trimmed birds, and P = 0.08 in non-beak-trimmed birds). This
   suggests an insufficient number of records on FCS. Individual's NAb
   isotypes titers did not show direct effect for FCS of itself, but
   individual's IgG titers showed a suggestive effect on the FCS of cage
   mates (associative effect) in beak-trimmed laying hens, which need
   further confirmation.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Social selection and indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are established
   concepts in both behavioural ecology and evolutionary genetics. While
   IGEs describe effects of an individual's genotype on phenotypes of
   social partners (and may thus affect their fitness indirectly), the
   concept of social selection assumes that a given phenotype in one
   individual affects the fitness of other individuals directly. Although
   different frameworks, both have been used to investigate the evolution
   of social traits, such as cooperative behaviour. Despite their
   similarities (both concepts consider interactions among individuals),
   they differ in the type of interaction. It remains unclear whether the
   two concepts make the same predictions about evolutionary trajectories
   or not. To address this question, we investigate four possible scenarios
   of social interactions and compare the effects of IGEs and social
   selection for trait evolution in a multi-trait multi-member model. We
   show that the two mechanisms can yield similar evolutionary outcomes and
   that both can create selection pressure at the group level. However, the
   effect of IGEs can be stronger due to the possibility of feedback loops.
   Finally, we demonstrate that IGEs, but not social selection gradients,
   may lead to differences in the direction of evolutionary response
   between genotypes and phenotypes.}},

Title = {{The multivariate egg: quantifying within- and among-clutch correlations

   multivariate mixed models}},
Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{174}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Egg components are important mediators of prenatal maternal effects in
   birds and other oviparous species. Because different egg components can
   have opposite effects on offspring phenotype, selection is expected to
   favour their mutual adjustment, resulting in a significant covariation
   between egg components within and/or among clutches. Here we tested for
   such correlations between maternally derived yolk immunoglobulins and
   yolk androgens in great tit (Parus major) eggs using a multivariate
   mixed-model approach. We found no association between yolk
   immunoglobulins and yolk androgens within clutches, indicating that
   within clutches the two egg components are deposited independently.
   Across clutches, however, there was a significant negative relationship
   between yolk immunoglobulins and yolk androgens, suggesting that
   selection has co-adjusted their deposition. Furthermore, an experimental
   manipulation of ectoparasite load affected patterns of covariance among
   egg components. Yolk immunoglobulins are known to play an important role
   in nestling immune defence shortly after hatching, whereas yolk
   androgens, although having growth-enhancing effects under many
   environmental conditions, can be immunosuppressive. We therefore
   speculate that variation in the risk of parasitism may play an important
   role in shaping optimal egg composition and may lead to the observed
   pattern of yolk immunoglobulin and yolk androgen deposition across
   clutches. More generally, our case study exemplifies how multivariate
   mixed-model methodology presents a flexible tool to not only quantify,
   but also test patterns of (co)variation across different organisational
   levels and environments, allowing for powerful hypothesis testing in
   ecophysiology.}},

Title = {{Epistasis between adults and larvae underlies caste fate and fitness in
   a clonal ant}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In social species, the phenotype and fitness of an individual depend in
   part on the genotype of its social partners. However, how these indirect
   genetic effects affect genotype fitness in competitive situations is
   poorly understood in animal societies. We therefore studied phenotypic
   plasticity and fitness of two clones of the ant Cerapachys biroi in
   monoclonal and chimeric colonies. Here we show that, while clone B has
   lower fitness in isolation, surprisingly, it consistently outcompetes
   clone A in chimeras. The reason is that, in chimeras, clone B produces
   more individuals specializing in reproduction rather than cooperative
   tasks, behaving like a facultative social parasite. A cross-fostering
   experiment shows that the proportion of these individuals depends on
   intergenomic epistasis between larvae and nursing adults, explaining the
   flexible allocation strategy of clone B. Our results suggest that
   intergenomic epistasis can be the proximate mechanism for social
   parasitism in ants, revealing striking analogies between social insects
   and social microbes.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{55-64}},

Abstract = {{1Both abiotic and biotic gradients exist in soils, and several of these
   gradients have been shown to select for plant traits. Moreover, plants
   possess a multitude of traits that can lead to strong niche construction
   (i.e. plant-induced changes to soils). Our objectives in this paper are
   to outline both empirical and theoretical evidence for the evolutionary
   consequences of plant-soil linkages and feedbacks on plants along soil
   heterogeneity gradients. We describe a simple mathematical model of
   plant evolution to explore the relationship between the sign and
   magnitude of feedback and the divergence of plant traits. We also
   constructed an individual-based simulation model to study the conditions
   under which plant-soil feedbacks occur, niche construction evolves, and
   plant traits diverge. This approach allows us to address specific
   hypotheses regarding relationships between positive and negative
   plant-soil feedback with variation in niche construction, the strength
   of selective gradients and the relative importance of local adaptation
   vs. feedbacks. The models suggest that feedbacks between soils and
   plants may commonly result in evolutionary interactions. The simulation
   model indicates that plant traits can diverge with niche construction
   and traits can be selected for in response to niche construction.
   However, the magnitude of feedbacks and how strongly they evolve depends
   on the amount of gene flow and the strength of selective gradients over
   time. These results suggest that plant-soil feedback can lead to
   evolution in plants and reveals new research directions for further
   inquiry. Questions addressing trade-offs and relationships between
   positive and negative feedbacks as well as adaptation and maladaptation
   of plant traits represent important frontiers in plant-soil feedback
   studies.}},

   examine how an individual male's identity may be related to phenotypic
   variation in short-term female fecundity in the model species,
   Drosophila melanogaster. The effect of male identity on short-term
   fecundity stimulation of females was repeatable across time and
   accounted for over a fifth of the total observed phenotypic variation in
   fecundity in two independent populations. The functional explanations
   for these results and the implications for our understanding of the
   factors that contribute to the adaptive significance of mating
   preferences and/or sexual conflict are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of a pig is not only affected by its own genes, but also by
   the genes of its pen mates. This indirect effect on a pig's growth is
   represented as social breeding value (SBV) in a newly developed breeding
   model. It has been hypothesized that pigs could affect their pen mates'
   growth through their behavior. We investigated whether pigs selected for
   a relatively positive (+SBV) or negative genetic effect (-SBV) on the
   growth of their pen mates and kept in either barren or straw-enriched
   pens differ in fearfulness. Effects of coping style, as assessed in a
   backtest, and gender were also investigated. Pigs (n = 480) were
   subjected to a group-wise novel rope test and human approach test and
   individually to a novel environment test in which after 5 min a bucket
   was lowered from the ceiling. In the novel rope test +SBV pigs were
   faster than SBV pigs to touch a rope (P<0.01) and in the novel
   environment test +SBV pigs showed less locomotion than SBV pigs after
   introduction of the bucket (P<0.05). Furthermore, straw-enriched pigs
   were faster than barren housed pigs to touch a rope in the novel rope
   test (P<0.10) and faster to approach (P<0.05) and touch a person
   (P<0.05) in the human approach test, suggesting that they are less
   fearful or more curious than pigs in barren housing. Straw-enriched pigs
   also had lower salivary cortisol concentrations than barren housed pigs
   (P<0.001). Pigs classified as high-resisting in the backtest spent more
   time near the person in the human approach test (P<0.10) and showed more
   locomotion (P<0.10) and vocalizations (P<0.001) after introduction of
   the bucket in the novel environment test than low-resisting pigs. Gilts
   appeared less fearful than barrows, because they were faster to touch a
   rope in the novel rope test (P<0.05) and faster to approach (P<0.05) and
   touch a person (P<0.10) in the human approach test. In addition, in the
   novel environment test, gilts were more calm (P<0.05) in the period
   before the bucket was introduced, paid more attention to the bucket once
   it was lowered (P<0.10) and were overall more active (P<0.01). Gilts
   also had lower basal cortisol concentrations than barrows (P<0.001).
   Overall, these results suggest that +SBV pigs might be less fearful than
   SBV pigs. Furthermore, the response of pigs in novelty tests seems to
   depend also on their housing conditions, coping style, and gender. (C)

Abstract = {{Maternal effects can dramatically influence the evolutionary process, in
   some cases facilitating and in others hindering adaptive evolution.
   Maternal effects have been incorporated into quantitative genetic models
   using two theoretical frameworks: the variance-components approach,
   which partitions variance into direct and maternal components, and the
   trait-based approach, which assumes that maternal effects are mediated
   by specific maternal traits. Here, we demonstrate parallels between
   these models and test their ability to predict evolutionary change.
   First, we show that the two approaches predict equivalent responses to
   selection in the absence of maternal effects mediated by traits that are
   themselves maternally influenced. We also introduce a correction factor
   that may be applied when such cascading maternal effects are present.
   Second, we use several maternal effect models, as well as the standard
   breeder's equation, to predict evolution in response to artificial
   selection on flowering time in American bellflower, Campanulastrum
   americanum. Models that included maternal effects made much more
   accurate predictions of selection response than the breeder's equation.
   Maternal effect models differed somewhat in their fit, with a version of
   the trait-based model providing the best fit. We recommend fitting such
   trait-based models when possible and appropriate to make the most
   accurate evolutionary predictions.}},

Abstract = {{1Predicting the response of communities and ecosystems to range shifts
   as a consequence of global climate change is a critical challenge
   confronting modern evolutionary ecologists. Indirect genetic effects
   (IGEs) occur when the expression of genes in a conspecific neighbouring
   species affects the phenotype of a focal species, and the same concept
   applies for interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGEs) except that
   the neighbouring species is then required to be heterospecific. Theory
   and empirical data indicate that indirect genetic effects and
   interspecific indirect genetic effects have fundamental roles in
   understanding the consequences of genotypic diversity, evolutionary
   feedbacks, the co-evolutionary process and coadaptation and are a
   primary mechanism for the broad ecological and evolutionary dynamics
   that are likely to be a consequence of climate change. When indirect
   genetic effects and interspecific indirect genetic effects occur along
   environmental gradients, both positive and negative feedbacks can
   evolve, resulting in regions of strong local adaptation and competition
   as well as regions of complementarity and facilitation. Such
   evolutionary dynamics have direct consequences for how individuals
   interact and evolve in mixture and drive the services ecosystems
   provide. Integrating indirect genetic effects and interspecific indirect
   genetic effects, feedbacks and diversity effects along environmental
   gradients represents a major conceptual, theoretical and empirical
   frontier that must be considered to understand the whole-system
   consequences of climate change on biodiversity and the services
   ecosystems provide.}},

Abstract = {{Diversified cropping systems can have high soil microbial biomass and
   thus strong potential to reduce the weed seedbank through seed decay.
   This study, conducted in Iowa, USA, evaluated the hypothesis that weed
   seed decay is higher in a diversified 4-year
   maize-soyabean-oat/lucerne-lucerne cropping system than in a
   conventional 2-year maize-soyabean rotation. Mesh bags filled with
   either Setaria faberi or Abutilon theophrasti seeds and soil were buried
   at two depths in the maize phase of the two cropping systems and sampled
   over a 3-year period. Setaria faberi seed decay was consistently greater
   at 2cm than at 20cm burial depth and was higher in the more diverse
   rotation than in the conventional rotation in 1year. Abutilon
   theophrasti seeds decayed very little in comparison with seeds of
   S.faberi. Separate laboratory and field experiments confirmed
   differences in germination and seed decay among the seed lots evaluated
   each year. Fusarium, Pythium, Alternaria, Cladosporium and Trichoderma
   were the most abundant genera colonising seeds of both species. A
   glasshouse experiment determined a relationship between Pythium ultimum
   and S.faberi seed decay. Possible differences in seed susceptibility to
   decay indicate the need to evaluate weed seedbank dynamics in different
   cropping systems when evaluating overall population dynamics and
   formulating weed management strategies.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{18-24}},
Abstract = {{A broad variability of yolk androgen levels is considered as an
   important source of adaptive phenotypic plasticity. This variability of
   maternal androgen deposition is explained by environmental variation and
   also by genetic differences among avian mothers. We experimentally
   investigated such heritable variation of testosterone (T) levels in the
   egg through the bidirectional selection of Japanese quail. The response
   to selection for yolk T concentrations was evaluated in downward (low
   egg T, LET) and upward (high egg T, HET) directions over five
   generations. Moreover, the correlative response of circulating sex
   steroids to selection was examined by a comparison of plasma T and
   estradiol levels between the HET and LET females. We observed a distinct
   pattern of the response to selection in the HET and LET lines with the
   stronger response occurring in the upward direction and a limited
   potential for selection in the downward direction. In the HET line, the
   population mean increased more than double as compared to the initial
   population but it seems to be still below its plateau. The LET line
   reached the selection limit in the second generation suggesting that
   yolk T concentrations were close to their physiological minimum.
   Estradiol levels were higher in the circulation of the HET than LET
   females without changes in plasma T concentrations underlying specific
   control mechanisms for yolk and plasma hormone levels.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation in plants can influence the community structure of
   associated species, through both direct and indirect interactions.
   Herbivorous insects are known to feed on a restricted range of plants,
   and herbivore preference and performance can vary among host plants
   within a species due to genetically based traits of the plant (e.g.,
   defensive compounds). In a natural system, we expect to find genetic
   variation within both plant and herbivore communities and we expect this
   variation to influence species interactions. Using a three-species
   plant-aphid model system, we investigated the effect of genetic
   diversity on genetic interactions among the community members. Our
   system involved a host plant (Hordeum vulgare) that was shared by an
   aphid (Sitobion avenae) and a hemi-parasitic plant (Rhinanthus minor).
   We showed that aphids cluster more tightly in a genetically diverse
   host-plant community than in a genetic monoculture, with host-plant
   genetic diversity explaining up to 24\% of the variation in aphid
   distribution. This is driven by differing preferences of the aphids to
   the different plant genotypes and their resulting performance on these
   plants. Within the two host-plant diversity levels, aphid spatial
   distribution was influenced by an interaction among the aphid's own
   genotype, the genotype of a competing aphid, the origin of the parasitic
   plant population, and the host-plant genotype. Thus, the overall outcome
   involves both direct (i.e., host plant to aphid) and indirect (i.e.,
   parasitic plant to aphid) interactions across all these species. These
   results show that a complex genetic environment influences the
   distribution of herbivores among host plants. Thus, in genetically
   diverse systems, interspecific genetic interactions between the host
   plant and herbivore can influence the population dynamics of the system
   and could also structure local communities. We suggest that direct and
   indirect genotypic interactions among species can influence community
   structure and processes.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGE) occur when the genotype of an individual
   affects the phenotypic trait value of another conspecific individual.
   IGEs can have profound effects on both the magnitude and the direction
   of response to selection. Models of inheritance and response to
   selection in traits subject to IGEs have been developed within two
   frameworks; a trait-based framework in which IGEs are specified as a
   direct consequence of individual trait values, and a variance-component
   framework in which phenotypic variance is decomposed into a direct and
   an indirect additive genetic component. This work is a selective review
   of the quantitative genetics of traits affected by IGEs, with a focus on
   modelling, estimation and interpretation issues. It includes a
   discussion on variance-component vs trait-based models of IGEs, a review
   of issues related to the estimation of IGEs from field data, including
   the estimation of the interaction coefficient W (psi), and a discussion
   on the relevance of IGEs for response to selection in cases where the
   strength of interaction varies among pairs of individuals. An
   investigation of the trait-based model shows that the interaction
   coefficient W may deviate considerably from the corresponding regression
   coefficient when feedback occurs. The increasing research effort devoted
   to IGEs suggests that they are a widespread phenomenon, probably
   particularly in natural populations and plants. Further work in this
   field should considerably broaden our understanding of the quantitative
   genetics of inheritance and response to selection in relation to the
   social organisation of populations.}},

Abstract = {{Social dynamics, the emergent effects of interactions within structured
   groups, play a key role in shaping social phenotypes and fitness. We
   examined the potential positive and negative effects of social dynamics
   in simple groups, by creating social groups of harvester ant queens with
   2 alternate nest-founding strategies, solitary versus cooperative. We
   compared social interactions, survival, and nest productivity of pairs
   containing queens from the cooperative founding population, the normally
   solitary founding population, or mixed pairs of the 2 types. Expressed
   social phenotypes of queens in pairs depended strongly on the lineage of
   the other queen. Two behaviors, aggression and brood care, showed simple
   social dynamical effects. Aggression escalated in pairs of normally
   solitary queens, whereas queens in cooperative pairs coordinated brood
   output, leading to more efficient worker production. These dynamics had
   context-based fitness consequences, such that cooperative queens gained
   a survival advantage in cooperative pairs, but neither type of queen
   experienced an advantage or disadvantage in ``mixed{''} associations.
   The interplay between social dynamics and fitness in these associations
   provides an empirical example of social selection. It captures a likely
   scenario of the transition to and the early evolution of cooperative
   living, in which cooperative individuals interact with solitary
   individuals who lack a priori strategies for cooperation or cheating.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of avian species have shown that maternal effects mediated by
   the transfer of egg hormones can profoundly affect offspring phenotype
   and fitness. We previously demonstrated that the injection of a
   physiological amount of testosterone (T) in the eggs of ring-necked
   pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) disrupted the covariation among male
   morphological traits at sexual maturity and positively affected male
   mating success. Here, we investigate whether egg T exposure affected
   adult male circulating T levels at the onset of the breeding season
   (reflecting gonadal maturation), and the relationship between
   circulating T and male traits. Egg T exposure did not affect pre-mating
   plasma T. T levels were not associated with the expression of secondary
   sexual and non-sexual traits or socio-sexual behaviour (social rank,
   overall fighting ability and mating success). However, wattle brightness
   decreased with increasing circulating T in males hatched from T-eggs
   (T-males) but not among control males. In dyadic encounters during the
   peak mating period, control males with higher pre-mating T levels had
   higher chances of being dominant over other control males. However,
   higher pre-mating T levels did not predict success in male-male
   competition in encounters involving T-males. We suggest that the
   long-term effects of egg T on male phenotype do not originate from
   differential gonadal maturation according to egg T treatment. Rather,
   prenatal androgens may have priming effects on functioning of target
   tissues, translating into differential phenotypic effects according to
   androgen exposure during embryonic development.}},

Abstract = {{Replicated selection experiments provide a powerful way to study how
   multiple adaptive solutions may lead to differences in the
   quantitative-genetic architecture of selected traits and whether this
   may translate into differences in the timing at which evolutionary
   limits are reached. We analyze data from 31 generations (n = 17,988) of
   selection on voluntary wheel running in house mice. The rate of initial
   response, timing of selection limit, and height of the plateau varied
   significantly between sexes and among the four selected lines. Analyses
   of litter size and realized selection differentials seem to rule out
   counterposing natural selection as a cause of the selection limits.
   Animal-model analyses showed that although the additive genetic variance
   was significantly lower in selected than control lines, both before and
   after the limits, the decrease was not sufficient to explain the limits.
   Moreover, directional selection promoted a negative covariance between
   additive and maternal genetic variance over the first 10 generations.
   These results stress the importance of replication in selection studies
   of higher-level traits and highlight the fact that long-term predictions
   of response to selection are not necessarily expected to be linear
   because of the variable effects of selection on additive genetic
   variance and maternal effects.}},

Abstract = {{Many social behaviors are triggered by social partners. For example,
   cells in a multicellular organism often become soma via extrinsically
   regulated differentiation, while individuals in a eusocial colony often
   become helpers via extrinsic caste determination. One explanation for
   social triggering is that it informs when it is beneficial to express
   the behavior. Alternatively, social triggering can represent
   manipulation where social partners partially or completely control the
   focal individual''s behavior. For instance, caste determination in
   primitively eusocial taxa is typically accomplished via differential
   feeding or dominance hierarchies, suggesting some manipulation. However,
   selection would favor resistance if manipulation is detrimental to
   manipulated parties, and the outcome of the manipulation conflict
   remains intricate. We analyze the coevolution of manipulation and
   resistance in a simple but general setting. We show that, despite
   possible resistance, manipulated behavior can be established under less
   stringent conditions than spontaneous (i.e., nonmanipulated) behavior
   because of resistance costs. The existence of this advantage might
   explain why primitive eusocial behavior tends to be triggered socially
   and coercively. We provide a simple condition for the advantage of
   manipulated behavior that may help infer whether a socially triggered
   behavior is manipulated. We illustrate our analysis with a hypothetical
   example of maternal manipulation relevant to primitive eusociality.}},

Abstract = {{Pigs housed together in a group influence each other's growth. Part of
   this effect is genetic and can be represented in a social breeding
   value. It is unknown, however, which traits are associated with social
   breeding values. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate
   whether personality and response to novelty could be associated with
   social breeding values for growth in piglets. Female and castrated male
   piglets from 80 litters, with either an estimated relative positive or
   negative social breeding value (+SBV or -SBV) for growth, were
   individually tested in a backtest and novel environment test, and
   group-wise in a novel object (i.e., a feeder with feed) test and human
   approach test. All tests were performed during the suckling period. No
   differences between +SBV and -SBV piglets were found for the frequency
   and latency of struggling and vocalizing in the backtest (at least, P >
   0.30). In the novel object test, piglets with a +SBV for growth touched
   the feeder faster than piglets with -SBV for growth (P = 0.01) and were
   more frequently present near the person in the human approach test (P <
   0.01). No behavioral differences between +SBV and -SBV pig-lets were
   found in the novel environment test (at least, P > 0.40), but piglets
   that struggled more in the backtest walked more in this test (P = 0.02).
   Behavior was affected by gender in each test. Female piglets were faster
   than castrated male piglets to start struggling in the backtest (P =
   0.047). In the novel object test, females were faster than males to
   touch the feeder and sample the feed. In the human approach test, they
   were also faster than male piglets to touch a person (all, P < 0.001).
   Females were also more frequently present near the feeder (P < 0.001)
   and person (P = 0.03). In the novel environment test, female piglets
   explored the floor more (P = 0.046), produced less low-(P = 0.04) and
   high-pitched vocalizations (P = 0.02), and defecated (P = 0.08) and
   urinated less than male piglets (P < 0.01). It was concluded that +SBV
   and -SBV piglets do not differ in their response to the backtest, and
   only subtle differences were found in their response to novelty. More
   research is warranted to identify the traits underlying SBV for growth
   in pigs. Moreover, castrated male piglets seemed to react more fearfully
   to each test than female piglets.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a vast literature on the factors controlling adult size, few
   studies have investigated how maternal size affects offspring size
   independent of direct genetic effects, thereby separating prenatal from
   postnatal influences. I used a novel experimental design that combined a
   cross-fostering approach with phenotypic manipulation of maternal body
   size that allowed me to disentangle prenatal and postnatal maternal
   effects. Using the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides as model
   organism, I found that a mother's body size affected egg size as well as
   the quality of postnatal maternal care, with larger mothers producing
   larger eggs and raising larger offspring than smaller females. However,
   with respect to the relative importance of prenatal and postnatal
   maternal effects on offspring growth, only the postnatal effects were
   important in determining offspring body size. Thus, prenatal effects can
   be offset by the quality of postnatal maternal care. This finding has
   implications for the coevolution of prenatal and postnatal maternal
   effects as they arise as a consequence of maternal body size. In
   general, my study provides evidence that there can be transgenerational
   phenotypic plasticity, with maternal size determining offspring size
   leading to a resemblance between mothers and their offspring above and
   beyond any direct genetic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Outbreeding between segregating populations can be important from an
   evolutionary, conservation and economical-agricultural perspective.
   Whether and how outbreeding influences maternal effects in wild
   populations has rarely been studied, despite both the prominent maternal
   influence on early offspring survival and the known presence of fitness
   effects resulting from outbreeding in many taxa. We studied several
   traits during the yolk-feeding stage in multigenerational crosses
   between a wild and a domesticated Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)
   population up to their third-generation hybrid in a common laboratory
   environment. Using cross-means analysis, we inferred that maternal
   additive outbreeding effects underlie most offspring traits but that
   yolk mass also underlies maternal dominant effects. As a consequence of
   the interplay between additive and dominant maternally controlled
   traits, offspring from first-generation hybrid mothers expressed an
   excessive proportion of residual yolk mass, relative to total mass, at
   the time of first feeding. Their residual yolk mass was 23-97\% greater
   than those of other crosses and 31\% more than that predicted by a
   purely additive model. Offspring additive, epistatic and epistatic
   offspring-by-maternal outbreeding effects appeared to further modify
   this largely maternally controlled cross-means pattern, resulting in an
   increase in offspring size with the percentage of domesticated alleles.
   Fitness implications remain elusive because of unknown
   phenotype-by-environment interactions. However, these results suggest
   how mechanistically co-adapted genetic maternal control on early
   offspring development can be disrupted by the effects of combining
   alleles from divergent populations. Complex outbreeding effects at both
   the maternal and offspring levels make the prediction of hybrid
   phenotypes difficult.}},

Abstract = {{Parents can influence the phenotype of their offspring through various
   mechanisms, besides the direct effect of heredity. Such parental effects
   are little explored in parasitic organisms, perhaps because in many
   parasites, per capita investment into offspring is low. I investigated
   whether parental identity, beyond direct genetic effects, could explain
   variation in the performance of the tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus in
   its first intermediate host, a copepod. I first determined that two
   breeding worms could be separated from one another after similar to 48h
   of in vitro incubation and that the isolated worms continued producing
   outcrossed eggs, that is, rates self-fertilization did not increase
   after separation. Thus, from a breeding pair, two sets of genetically
   comparable eggs can be collected that have unambiguous parental
   identities. In an infection experiment, I found that the development of
   larval worms tended to vary between the two parental worms within
   breeding pairs, but infection success and growth rate in copepods did
   not. Accounting for this parental effect decreased the estimated
   heritability for development by nearly half. These results suggest that
   larval performance is not simply a function of a worm's genotype; who
   mothered or fathered an offspring can also affect offspring fitness,
   contradicting the perhaps naive idea that parasites simply produce large
   quantities of uniformly low-quality offspring.}},

Title = {{Using pooled data to estimate variance components and breeding values
   for traits affected by social interactions}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{45}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Through social interactions, individuals affect one
   another's phenotype. In such cases, an individual's phenotype is
   affected by the direct (genetic) effect of the individual itself and the
   indirect (genetic) effects of the group mates. Using data on individual
   phenotypes, direct and indirect genetic (co)variances can be estimated.
   Together, they compose the total genetic variance that determines a
   population's potential to respond to selection. However, it can be
   difficult or expensive to obtain individual phenotypes. Phenotypes on
   traits such as egg production and feed intake are, therefore, often
   collected on group level. In this study, we investigated whether direct,
   indirect and total genetic variances, and breeding values can be
   estimated from pooled data (pooled by group). In addition, we determined
   the optimal group composition, i.e. the optimal number of families
   represented in a group to minimise the standard error of the estimates.
   Methods: This study was performed in three steps. First, all research
   questions were answered by theoretical derivations. Second, a simulation
   study was conducted to investigate the estimation of variance components
   and optimal group composition. Third, individual and pooled survival
   records on 12 944 purebred laying hens were analysed to investigate the
   estimation of breeding values and response to selection.
   Results: Through theoretical derivations and simulations, we showed that
   the total genetic variance can be estimated from pooled data, but the
   underlying direct and indirect genetic (co)variances cannot. Moreover,
   we showed that the most accurate estimates are obtained when group
   members belong to the same family. Additional theoretical derivations
   and data analyses on survival records showed that the total genetic
   variance and breeding values can be estimated from pooled data.
   Moreover, the correlation between the estimated total breeding values
   obtained from individual and pooled data was surprisingly close to one.
   This indicates that, for survival in purebred laying hens, loss in
   response to selection will be small when using pooled instead of
   individual data.
   Conclusions: Using pooled data, the total genetic variance and breeding
   values can be estimated, but the underlying genetic components cannot.
   The most accurate estimates are obtained when group members belong to
   the same family.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{280}},
Number = {{1763}},
Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Patterns of phenotypic variation arise in part from plasticity owing to
   social interactions, and these patterns contribute, in turn, to the form
   of selection that shapes the variation we observe in natural
   populations. This proximate-ultimate dynamic brings genetic variation in
   social environments to the forefront of evolutionary theory. However,
   the extent of this variation remains largely unknown. Here, we use a
   member of the Enchenopa binotata species complex of treehoppers
   (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to assess how mate preferences are influenced
   by genetic variation in the social environment. We used full-sibling
   split-families as `treatment' social environments, and reared focal
   females alongside each treatment family, describing the mate preferences
   of the focal females. With this method, we detected substantial genetic
   variation in social influence on mate preferences. The mate preferences
   of focal females varied according to the treatment families along with
   which they grew up. We discuss the evolutionary implications of the
   presence of such genetic variation in social influence on mate
   preferences, including potential contributions to the maintenance of
   genetic variation, the promotion of divergence, and the adaptive
   evolution of social effects on fitness-related traits.}},

Abstract = {{This article is part of a Special Issue ``Puberty and Adolescence{''}.
   The onset of reproduction is preceded by a host of organismal
   adjustments and transformations, involving morphological, physiological,
   and behavioral changes. In highly social mammals, including humans and
   most nonhuman primates, the timing and nature of maturational processes
   are affected by the animal's social milieu as well as its ecology. Here,
   we review a diverse set of findings on how maturation unfolds in wild
   baboons in the Amboseli basin of southern Kenya, and we place these
   findings in the context of other reports of maturational processes in
   primates and other mammals. First, we describe the series of events and
   processes that signal maturation in female and male baboons. Sex
   differences in age at both sexual maturity and first reproduction
   documented for this species are consistent with expectations of life
   history theory; males mature later than females and exhibit an
   adolescent growth spurt that is absent or minimal in females. Second, we
   summarize what we know about sources of variance in the timing of
   maturational processes including natal dispersal. In Amboseli,
   individuals in a food-enhanced group mature earlier than their
   wild-feeding counterparts, and offspring of high-ranking females mature
   earlier than offspring of low-ranking females. We also report on how
   genetic admixture, which occurs in Amboseli between two closely related
   baboon taxa, affects individual maturation schedules. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Indirect Genetic Effects and Housing Conditions in Relation to
   Aggressive Behaviour in Pigs}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Indirect Genetic Effects (IGEs), also known as associative effects, are
   the heritable effects that an individual has on the phenotype of its
   social partners. Selection for IGEs has been proposed as a method to
   reduce harmful behaviours, in particular aggression, in livestock and
   aquaculture. The mechanisms behind IGEs, however, have rarely been
   studied. The objective was therefore to assess aggression in pigs which
   were divergently selected for IGEs on growth (IGEg). In a one generation
   selection experiment, we studied 480 offspring of pigs (Sus scrofa) that
   were selected for relatively high or low IGEg and housed in homogeneous
   IGEg groups in either barren or enriched environments. Skin lesion
   scores, a proxy measure of aggression, and aggressive behaviours were
   recorded. The two distinct IGEg groups did not differ in number of skin
   lesions, or in amount of reciprocal fighting, both under stable social
   conditions and in confrontation with unfamiliar pigs in a 24 h
   regrouping test. Pigs selected for a positive effect on the growth of
   their group members, however, performed less non-reciprocal biting and
   showed considerably less aggression at reunion with familiar group
   members after they had been separated during a 24 h regrouping test. The
   enriched environment was associated with more skin lesions but less
   non-reciprocal biting under stable social conditions. Changes in
   aggression between pigs selected for IGEg were not influenced by GxE
   interactions with regard to the level of environmental enrichment. It is
   likely that selection on IGEg targets a behavioural strategy, rather
   than a single behavioural trait such as aggressiveness.}},

Abstract = {{In some animals, offspring begging is elicited by parents through
   behavioural or morphological signals. The red spot on the lower mandible
   in adult gulls is one of the best-known examples of a signal triggering
   chick begging. We examined whether the begging response of chicks
   (pecking for food and the chatter call for drawing parental attention)
   was affected by the spot size within the natural range of variation on a
   dummy head. Using a cross-fostering experiment, we examined whether
   these responses covary with the size of the genetic or social parent's
   spot. We found that the natural variation in size of this parental
   signal strongly influenced intensity of chick begging. Pecking increased
   when chicks were stimulated by a larger red spot. Additionally, pecking
   intensity increased in chicks reared by mothers with a large red spot,
   suggesting that this begging component is influenced by previous
   experience. In contrast, chick hatching order affected the number of
   chatter calls produced in relation to the size of the red spot on the
   dummy, suggesting the presence of different begging strategies according
   to brood hierarchy. The differential call response to a small/large red
   spot on the dummy was positively correlated with the original mothers'
   red spot size and negatively with that of the original fathers. These
   results suggest a genetic correlation between biased chick response for
   a large spot and parental signal in contrasting patterns for mothers and
   fathers. Our results suggest that the parental red spot and offspring
   begging are traits subject to coevolution. (C) 2013 The Association for

Abstract = {{Kin selection theory is a kind of causal analysis. The initial form of
   kin selection ascribed cause to costs, benefits and genetic relatedness.
   The theory then slowly developed a deeper and more sophisticated
   approach to partitioning the causes of social evolution. Controversy
   followed because causal analysis inevitably attracts opposing views. It
   is always possible to separate total effects into different component
   causes. Alternative causal schemes emphasize different aspects of a
   problem, reflecting the distinct goals, interests and biases of
   different perspectives. For example, group selection is a particular
   causal scheme with certain advantages and significant limitations.
   Ultimately, to use kin selection theory to analyse natural patterns and
   to understand the history of debates over different approaches, one must
   follow the underlying history of causal analysis. This article describes
   the history of kin selection theory, with emphasis on how the causal
   perspective improved through the study of key patterns of natural
   history, such as dispersal and sex ratio, and through a unified approach
   to demographic and social processes. Independent historical developments
   in the multivariate analysis of quantitative traits merged with the
   causal analysis of social evolution by kin selection.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted comparing multilevel selection in Japanese
   quail for 43 days weight and survival with birds housed in either kin
   (K) or random (R) groups. Multilevel selection significantly reduced
   mortality (6.6\% K vs. 8.5\% R) and increased weight (1.30 g/MG K vs.
   0.13 g/MG R) resulting in response an order of magnitude greater with
   Kin than Random. Thus, multilevel selection was effective in reducing
   detrimental social interactions, which contributed to improved weight
   gain. The observed rates of response did not differ significantly from
   expected, demonstrating that current theory is adequate to explain
   multilevel selection response. Based on estimated genetic parameters,
   group selection would always be superior to any other combination of
   multilevel selection. Further, near optimal results could be attained
   using multilevel selection if 20\% of the weight was on the group
   component regardless of group composition. Thus, in nature the
   conditions for multilevel selection to be effective in bringing about
   social change maybe common. In terms of a sustainability of breeding
   programs, multilevel selection is easy to implement and is expected to
   give near optimal responses with reduced rates of inbreeding as compared
   to group selection, the only requirement is that animals be housed in
   kin groups.}},

Abstract = {{Mate choice often depends on the properties of both sexes, such as the
   preference and responsiveness of the female and the sexual display
   traits of the male. Quantitative genetic studies, however, traditionally
   explore the outcome of an interaction between males and females based
   solely on the genotype of one sex, treating the other sex as a source of
   environmental variance. Here, we use a half-sib breeding design in the
   field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus, to estimate the additive genetic
   contribution of both partners to three steps of the mate choice process:
   the time taken to mate; the duration of spermatophore attachment; and
   the intensity of mate guarding. Rather than each sex contributing
   equally to the interactions, we found that genetic variation for latency
   to mate and spermatophore attachment was sex-specific, and in the case
   of mate-guarding intensity, largely absent. For a given interaction,
   genetic variation in one sex also appears to be largely independent of
   the other, and is also uncorrelated with the other traits. We discuss
   how pre- and postcopulatory interactions have the potential to evolve as
   an interacting phenotype, but that any coevolution between these traits,
   due to sexual selection or sexual conflict, may be limited.}},

Abstract = {{Variation among aphid genotypes leads them to preferentially colonize
   different host-plant genotypes. In a natural community, different
   genotypes within a species are expected to coexist on a single host
   plant, and these aphids can interact, potentially, altering host-plant
   preferences. Using a model aphid (Sitobion avenae) and barley (Hordeum
   vulgare) system, we compared aphid preference and performance in one- or
   two-genotype colonies in pots with genetically diverse host plants (6
   genotypes) or genetically uniform host plants (1 genotype per pot).
   Aphid host preference was shown to differ when a second aphid genotype
   was present, with one aphid genotype exhibiting a preference change due
   to the genotypic identity of the second aphid. The population growth
   rate of the aphids was not influenced by the competitor, and thus, we
   conclude that these effects are due to aphid distribution (preference)
   rather than effects through performance. Our work demonstrates that
   within a complex ecological community, an individual's behavior can be
   influenced by interactions with other genotypes within the same species,
   as well as interactions with genotypes of other species.}},

Abstract = {{The evolutionary study of social systems in non-human primates has long
   been focused on ecological determinants. The predictive value of
   socio-ecological models remains quite low, however, in particular
   because such equilibrium models cannot integrate the course of history.
   The use of phylogenetic methods indicates that many patterns of primate
   societies have been conserved throughout evolutionary history. For
   example, the study of social relations in macaques revealed that their
   social systems are made of sets of correlated behavioural traits. Some
   macaque species are portrayed by marked social intolerance, a steep
   dominance gradient and strong nepotism, whereas others display a higher
   level of social tolerance, relaxed dominance and a weaker influence of
   kinship. Linkages between behavioural traits occur at different levels
   of organization, and act as constraints that limit evolutionary
   responses to external pressures. Whereas these constraints can exert
   strong stabilizing selection that opposes the potential changes required
   by the ecological environment, selective mechanisms may have the
   potential to switch the whole social system from one state to another by
   acting primarily on some key behavioural traits that could work as
   pacemakers.}},

Title = {{Disentangling spatio-temporal processes in a hierarchical system: a case
   study in fisheries discards}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, various spatial and temporal methodologies were
   developed to investigate the processes that drive ecological and
   evolutionary patterns. However, these methods frequently fail to
   acknowledge that the observed patterns result from the overlap of
   different underlying processes. In order to understand how the patterns
   are formed, we must have recourse to methods that allow us to
   disentangle these simultaneous processes. Here we develop a hierarchical
   spatial predictive process (PP) combined with a separable temporal PP to
   disentangle and describe those overlapping processes in one very
   frequent setting in ecology and evolution: multilevel spatio-temporally
   indexed data. We present our methodology through a case study of
   fisheries discards and investigate for example whether the inclusion of
   the hierarchical structure and the temporal processes of the system
   alter the observed spatial patterns. Recently it is recognized that
   understanding the processes driving discards is essential to sustainably
   manage and conserve marine resources. The results show that
   consideration of multiple underlying processes dramatically changes the
   pattern and characteristics of the discards hot- and coldspots. In the
   Irish Sea, the inclusion of the hierarchical structure of the system
   leads to the reduction of the hot- and coldspots. Simultaneously, our
   model identifies key bi-annual fluctuations in the temporal process
   which, together with the variance associated at the level of individual
   fishing trips in the hierarchical structure of the data explained most
   of the variance driving discards. Whether the hierarchical, spatial and
   temporal processes are considered together or not can profoundly alter
   our understanding of what constitutes an appropriate mitigation measure.
   Misidentification of hotspots can culminate in inappropriate mitigation
   practices which can sometimes be irreversible. As the proposed method
   offers a unified approach for understanding the processes that drive
   observed patterns, many areas in ecology such as conservation and
   epidemiological studies can benefit from its use, increasing the
   effectiveness of management plans.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to estimate (co) variance components

   series of six univariate linear animal models was used to estimate
   phenotypic variance and its direct, maternal and residual components. In
   addition, bivariate analyses were done to estimate (co) variance
   components between traits. Estimates of direct heritability (h(2)) were
   0.10, 0.11, 0.16, 0.09, 0.13, 0.13, 0.15 and 0.08 for ADGa, ADGb, ADGc,
   ADGd, KRa, KRb, KRc and KRd, respectively and indicate that in Mehraban
   sheep genes contribute very little to the variance of the growth rate
   and Kleiber ratio. Estimates of maternal heritability (m(2)) were 0.10,
   0.08 and 0.05 for ADGa, KRa and KRb, respectively. Direct additive
   genetic correlations ranged from -0.32 (KRa-KRd) to 0.99 (ADGb-KRb) and
   phenotypic correlations ranged from -0.53 (ADGa-ADGd) to 0.99
   (ADGa-KRa). Estimates of direct heritability and genetic correlations
   show that genetic improvement in efficiency of feed utilization through
   selection programmes is possible, though it would generate a relatively

Abstract = {{Provisioning behavior in altricial birds is often used to measure
   parental investment and is assumed to have fitness consequences to the
   parents providing it, with the benefits outweighing the costs. Here we
   investigate the fitness costs and benefits (parent survival and
   offspring recruitment) of provisioning behavior in wild house sparrows
   Passer domesticus, using long-term data from a pedigreed isolated
   population. We disentangled the long-term fitness consequences in terms
   of number of recruits, of provisioning behavior from those of other
   parental investments and individual quality through a cross-foster
   design. We accounted for extra-pair offspring in all analyses.
   Provisioning behavior confers social fitness benefits in terms of the
   number of recruits to both parents. Only in females we detected an
   influence individual quality: female sparrows with high provisioning
   frequencies were associated with more genetic recruits than those who
   provided food less frequently to their young, even though foster parents
   reared the offspring. We detected a relationship between annual survival
   probability and provisioning behavior only in males, but not in females.
   This finding, together with indirect benefits differing by sex,
   indicates that different selection pressures are acting on the sexes.
   Our study can show that it is justified to use provisioning behavior as
   a form of parental investment sensu Trivers, since we show that this
   behavior is costly to parents and that the genetic fitness benefits
   exceed the costs.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural traits that are consistent over time and in different
   contexts are often referred to as personality traits. These traits
   influence fitness because they play a major role in foraging,

   because, theoretically, they are under strong selection. Boldness and
   aggressiveness are two personality traits that have been shown to affect
   fitness. By crossing single males to multiple females, we estimated the
   heritability of boldness and aggressiveness in the zebrafish, Danio
   rerio. The additive genetic variance was statistically significant for
   both traits and the heritability estimates (95 \% confidence intervals)
   for boldness and aggressiveness were 0.76 (0.49, 0.90) and 0.36 (0.10,
   0.72) respectively. Furthermore, there were significant maternal effects
   accounting for 18 and 9 \% of the proportion of phenotypic variance in

Abstract = {{Genetic correlations between traits can constrain responses to natural
   selection. To what extent such correlations limit adaptation depends on
   patterns of directional selection. I derive the expected rate of
   adaptation (or evolvability) under randomly changing selection
   gradients. When directional selection gradients have an arbitrary
   covariance matrix, the average rate of adaptation depends on genetic
   correlations between traits, contrary to the isotropic case investigated
   in previous studies. Adaptation may be faster on average with more
   genetic correlation between traits, if these traits are selected to
   change jointly more often than the average pair of traits. However,
   natural selection maximizes the long-term fitness of a population, not
   necessarily its rate of adaptation. I therefore derive the average lag
   load caused by deviations of the mean phenotype from an optimum, under
   several forms of environmental changes typically experienced by natural
   populations, both stochastic and deterministic. Simple formulas are
   produced for how the G matrix affects long-term fitness in these
   contexts, and I discuss how their parameters can be estimated

Title = {{Birthweight discordant female twins and their offspring: is the
   intergenerational influence on birthweight due to genes or environment?}},
Journal = {{HUMAN REPRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Does the intergenerational influence on birthweight and birth length
   remain within female dizygotic and monozygotic twin pairs?
   The intergenerational influence on birthweight and birth length remained
   within dizygotic but not within monozygotic twin pairs.
   Low birthweight is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in
   both the short and long term; therefore it is important to understand
   determinants of fetal growth. There is a known intergenerational
   association between parents and offsprings size at birth.
   This is a register-based cohort study with a nested within-twin-pair
   comparison. The study is retrospective, but based on prospectively
   collected information. The study population included 8685 monozygotic
   and like-sexed dizygotic female twins born in Sweden from 1926 to 1985,
   who had given birth to their first infant between 1973 and 2009.
   This study is set in Sweden and used data from the Swedish Twin Register
   and the Swedish Medical Birth Register. We used generalized estimating
   equations to obtain regression coefficients with 95 confidence intervals
   (CI) for the outcomes: offspring birthweight and birth length. To
   control for genetic and shared environmental factors, we performed
   within-twin-pair analyses in 1479 dizygotic and 1526 monozygotic twin
   pairs.
   In the cohort of both dizygotic and monozygotic twins, there was an
   association between mothers and offsprings size at birth.
   Within-dizygotic twin pairs, a 500-g increase from the twin pairs mean
   birthweight was associated with increased offspring birthweight {[}70 g
   (95 CI: 35106)] and birth length {[}0.22 cm (95 CI: 0.070.38)]. The
   corresponding increase in birth length of 1 cm was estimated to increase
   offsprings birthweight by 26g (95 CI: 1240) and birth length by 0.11 cm
   (95 CI: 0.040.17). Within-monozygotic twin pairs there were no such
   associations.
   This study is limited to twins who themselves or whose co-twin
   voluntarily responded to questionnaires.
   The intergenerational influence on size at birth is suggested to be due
   to direct or indirect genetic factors.

Abstract = {{Available experimental evidence suggests that there are genetic
   differences in the abilities of trees to compete for resources, in
   addition to non-genetic differences due to micro-site variation. The use
   of indirect genetic effects within the framework of linear mixed model
   methodology has been proposed for estimating genetic parameters and
   responses to selection in the presence of genetic competition. In this
   context, an individual's total breeding value reflects the effects of
   its direct breeding value on its own phenotype and its competitive
   breeding value on the phenotype of its neighbours. The present study
   used simulated data to investigate the relevance of accounting for
   competitive effects at the genetic and non-genetic levels in terms of
   the estimation of (co)variance components and selection response.
   Different experimental designs that resulted in different genetic
   relatedness levels within a neighbourhood and survival were other key
   issues examined. Variances estimated for additive genetic and residual
   effects tended to be biased under models that ignored genetic
   competition. Models that fitted competition at the genetic level only
   also resulted in biased (co)variance estimates for direct additive,
   competitive additive and residual effects. The ability to detect the
   correct model was reduced when relatedness within a neighbourhood was
   very low and survival decreased. Selection responses changed
   considerably between selecting on breeding value estimates from a model
   ignoring genetic competition and total breeding estimates using the
   correct model. Our results suggest that considering a genetic basis to
   competitive ability will be important to optimise selection programmes
   for genetic improvement of tree species.}},

Title = {{The Afterlife of Interspecific Indirect Genetic Effects: Genotype
   Interactions Alter Litter Quality with Consequences for Decomposition
   and Nutrient Dynamics}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Aboveground-belowground linkages are recognized as divers of community
   dynamics and ecosystem processes, but the impacts of plant-neighbor
   interactions on these linkages are virtually unknown. Plant-neighbor
   interactions are a type of interspecific indirect genetic effect (IIGE)
   if the focal plant's phenotype is altered by the expression of genes in
   a neighboring heterospecific plant, and IIGEs could persist after plant
   senescence to affect ecosystem processes. This perspective can provide
   insight into how plant-neighbor interactions affect evolution, as IIGEs
   are capable of altering species interactions and community composition
   over time. Utilizing genotypes of Solidago altissima and Solidago
   gigantea, we experimentally tested whether IIGEs that had affected
   living focal plants would affect litter decomposition rate, as well as
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) dynamics after the focal plant
   senesced. We found that species interactions affected N release and
   genotype interactions affected P immobilization. From a previous study
   we knew that neighbor genotype influenced patterns of biomass allocation
   for focal plants. Here we extend those previous results to show that
   these changes in biomass allocation altered litter quality, that then
   altered rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling. Our results provide
   insights into above- and belowground linkages by showing that, through
   their effects on plant litter quality (e.g., litter lignin: N), IIGEs
   can have afterlife effects, tying plant-neighbor interactions to
   ecosystem processes. This holistic approach advances our understanding
   of decomposition and nutrient cycling by showing that evolutionary
   processes (i.e., IIGEs) can influence ecosystem functioning after plant
   senescence. Because plant traits are determined by the combined effects
   of genetic and environmental influences, and because these traits are
   known to affect decomposition and nutrient cycling, we suggest that
   ecosystem processes can be described as gene-less products of genetic
   interactions among the species comprising ecological communities.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are heritable effects of individuals on
   trait values of their conspecifics. IGEs may substantially affect
   response to selection, but empirical studies on IGEs are sparse and
   their magnitude and correlation with direct genetic effects are largely
   unknown in plants.
   Here we used linear mixed models to estimate genetic (co) variances
   attributable to direct and indirect effects for growth and foliar
   disease damage in a large pedigreed population of Eucalyptus globulus.
   We found significant IGEs for growth and disease damage, which increased
   with age for growth. The correlation between direct and indirect genetic
   effects was highly negative for growth, but highly positive for disease
   damage, consistent with neighbour competition and infection,
   respectively. IGEs increased heritable variation by 71\% for disease
   damage, but reduced heritable variation by 85\% for growth, leaving
   nonsignificant heritable variation for later age growth. Thus, IGEs are
   likely to prevent response to selection in growth, despite a
   considerable ordinary heritability.
   IGEs change our perspective on the genetic architecture and potential
   response to selection. Depending on the correlation between direct and
   indirect genetic effects, IGEs may enhance or diminish the response to
   natural or artificial selection compared with that predicted from
   ordinary heritability.}},

Title = {{Relationship between growth rate and oral manipulation, social nosing,

Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{1-2}},

Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Pigs may affect each other's health, welfare and productivity through
   their behaviour. The effect of a pig on the growth rate of its pen mates
   is partly heritable and is referred to as its social genetic effect.
   Social genetic effects, also known as indirect genetic effects, have
   been found in a number of livestock breeds, in natural and laboratory
   populations, and in plant breeding and forestry, and have become an
   important research topic in recent years. In pigs, social genetic
   effects are hypothesized to be related to behaviour. The mechanism
   behind social genetic effects for growth, as well as the relationship
   between behaviours and growth itself, is largely unknown. To gain
   insight in the mechanism behind social genetic effects, we investigated
   the relationship between behaviours and growth rate in pigs. On a
   commercial pig farm, 398 finishing pigs in 50 pens (eight pigs/pen) were
   observed at 12 weeks of age using 2-min instantaneous scan sampling for
   6 h during daytime. For 324 observed pigs, growth rate during the
   finishing period was known. The relationship between behaviours and
   growth rate during the finishing period was analysed with behaviour as
   explanatory variable in a mixed model. Results show that time spent
   giving behaviours, like oral manipulation, social nosing, aggression and
   belly nosing, was not related to own growth rate. Receiving behaviours,
   however, did relate to growth. Pigs that received more oral
   manipulation, observed as tail biting, ear biting and paw biting, grew
   less well (P < 0.05). Growth rate was 43(+/- 17) g/d lower in pigs that
   received oral manipulation during more than 2\% of the observations as
   compared to pigs that did not receive oral manipulation. Pigs that
   received social nosing, a gentle touch or sniff at any part of the body,
   had a higher growth rate (P < 0.05): growth rate differed 29(+/- 17)0
   between pigs that received social nosing during more than 2\% of
   observations as compared to not receiving social nosing at all.
   Receiving aggression and belly nosing, a forceful rubbing of the belly,
   did not influence growth rate. In conclusion, receiving oral
   manipulation and social nosing related to growth rate. This suggests
   that pigs selected for positive social genetic effects for growth may
   potentially show behavioural changes. Effects of selection for social
   genetic effects on behaviour and growth will be studied in future
   research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Interactions among Individuals Affect Direct Genetic Effects}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Traditional quantitative genetics assumes that an individual's phenotype
   is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. For many
   animals, part of the environment is social and provided by parents and
   other interacting partners. When expression of genes in social partners
   affects trait expression in a focal individual, indirect genetic effects
   occur. In this study, we explore the effects of indirect genetic effects
   on the magnitude and range of phenotypic values in a focal individual in
   a multi-member model analyzing three possible classes of interactions
   between individuals. We show that social interactions may not only cause
   indirect genetic effects but can also modify direct genetic effects.
   Furthermore, we demonstrate that both direct and indirect genetic
   effects substantially alter the range of phenotypic values, particularly
   when a focal trait can influence its own expression via interactions
   with traits in other individuals. We derive a function predicting the
   relative importance of direct versus indirect genetic effects. Our model
   reveals that both direct and indirect genetic effects can depend to a
   large extent on both group size and interaction strength, altering group
   mean phenotype and variance. This may lead to scenarios where between
   group variation is much higher than within group variation despite
   similar underlying genetic properties, potentially affecting the level
   of selection. Our analysis highlights key properties of indirect genetic
   effects with important consequences for trait evolution, the level of
   selection and potentially speciation.}},

Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of how genetic effects arising from parental care influence
   the evolution of offspring traits comes almost exclusively from studies
   of maternal care. However, males provide care in some taxa, and often
   this care differs from females in quality or quantity. If variation in
   paternal care is genetically based then, like maternal care and maternal
   effects, paternal effects may have important consequences for the
   evolution of offspring traits via indirect genetic effects (IGEs). IGEs
   and directindirect genetic covariances associated with parental care can
   contribute substantially to total heritability and influence predictions
   about how traits respond to selection. It is unknown, however, if the
   magnitude and sign of parental effects arising from fathers are the same
   as those arising from mothers. We used a reciprocal cross-fostering
   experiment to quantify environmental and genetic effects of paternal
   care on offspring performance in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus
   vespilloides. We found that IGEs were substantial and direct-indirect
   genetic covariances were negative. Combined, these patterns led to low
   total heritabilities for offspring performance traits. Thus, under
   paternal care, offspring performance traits are unlikely to evolve in
   response to selection, and variation in these traits will be maintained
   in the population despite potentially strong selection on these traits.
   These patterns are similar to those generated by maternal care,
   indicating that the genetic effects of care on offspring performance are
   independent of the caregiver's sex.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important defenses for the eggs of ovipositing female
   organisms is to avoid being laid in the same habitat as their predators.
   However, for most organisms, completely avoiding an offspring's
   predators is not possible. One mechanism that has been largely
   overlooked is for females to partition an oviposition site into
   microhabitats that differ in quality for offspring survival. We
   conducted a series of experiments to examine whether female newts avoid
   microhabitats utilized by their offspring's primary predator, caddisfly
   larvae. Female newts avoided laying eggs near predatory caddisflies and
   shifted egg laying upward in the water column when provided with a
   vertical dimension. Caddisflies were attracted to chemical stimuli from
   female newts and their eggs, yet primarily used benthic areas in
   experimental chambers. Finally, results from a field experiment indicate
   that the behavioral strategy employed by female newts increases
   offspring survival. This subset of non-genetic maternal effects,
   micro-oviposition avoidance, is likely an important yet underexplored
   mechanism by which females increase offspring survival.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects can be adaptive and because of their intrinsic time
   delays may have important effects on population dynamics. In
   vertebrates, and increasingly invertebrates, it is well established that
   offspring defence is in part determined by maternal parasite exposure.
   It has also been suggested that there may be indirect maternal effects
   on immunity mediated by other components of the maternal environment,
   including density and resource availability. Here, we examine the effect
   maternal resource availability has on the immunity of offspring in an
   insect-virus system. We use five different maternal resource levels and
   examine immunity in the offspring both directly, by challenge with a
   virus, and by measuring a major component of the immune system, across
   three offspring environments. Both the direct infection assay and the
   measure of immunocompetence show clearly that offspring from mothers in
   poor environments are more resistant to parasites. This may result from
   life-history optimization of mothers in poor environments, or because
   the poor environment acts as a cue for higher disease risk in the next
   generation. This emphasizes the importance of maternal effects on
   disease resistance, mediated through indirect environmental factors that
   will have important implications to both the ecological and evolutionary
   dynamics of host-parasite interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The family is an arena for conflicts between offspring, mothers and
   fathers that need resolving to promote the evolution of parental care
   and the maintenance of family life. Co-adaptation is known to contribute
   to the resolution of parent-offspring conflict over parental care by
   selecting for combinations of offspring demand and parental supply that
   match to maximize the fitness of family members. However, multiple
   paternity and differences in the level of care provided by mothers and
   fathers can generate antagonistic selection on offspring demand
   (mediated, for example, by genomic imprinting) and possibly hamper
   co-adaptation. While parent-offspring co-adaptation and parental
   antagonism are commonly considered two major processes in the evolution
   of family life, their co-occurrence and the evolutionary consequences of
   their joint action are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate the
   simultaneous and entangled effects of these two processes on outcomes of
   family interactions, using a series of breeding experiments in the
   European earwig, Forficula auricularia, an insect species with
   uniparental female care. As predicted from parental antagonism, we show
   that paternally inherited effects expressed in offspring influence both
   maternal care and maternal investment in future reproduction. However,
   and as expected from the entangled effects of parental antagonism and
   co-adaptation, these effects critically depended on postnatal
   interactions with caring females and maternally inherited effects
   expressed in offspring. Our results demonstrate that parent-offspring
   co-adaptation and parental antagonism are entangled key drivers in the
   evolution of family life that cannot be fully understood in isolation.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of theoretical models incorporate phenotypes expressed in the

   generate dynamics that alter evolution. This has proven to be a
   challenging and controversial proposition. However, several recent
   modelling frameworks provide insight: indirect genetic effect (IGE)
   models, niche construction models, and evolutionary feedback models.
   These distinct approaches converge upon the observation that gene action
   at a distance generates feedback that expands the range of trait values
   and evolutionary rates that we should expect to observe in empirical
   studies. Such conceptual replication provides solid evidence that traits
   with extended effects have important evolutionary consequences, but more
   empirical work is needed to evaluate the predictive power of different
   modelling approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Through social interactions, individuals can affect one another's
   phenotype. The heritable effect of an individual on the phenotype of a
   conspecific is known as an indirect genetic effect (IGE). Although IGEs
   can have a substantial impact on heritable variation and response to
   selection, little is known about the genetic architecture of traits
   affected by IGEs. We studied IGEs for survival in domestic chickens
   (Gallus gallus), using data on two purebred lines and their reciprocal
   cross. Birds were kept in groups of four. Feather pecking and
   cannibalism caused mortality, as beaks were kept intact. Survival time
   was shorter in crossbreds than in purebreds, indicating outbreeding
   depression and the presence of nonadditive genetic effects. IGEs
   contributed the majority of heritable variation in crossbreds (87 and
   72\%) and around half of heritable variation in purebreds (65 and 44\%).
   There was no evidence of dominance variance, neither direct nor
   indirect. Absence of dominance variance in combination with considerable
   outbreeding depression suggests that survival is affected by many loci.
   Direct-indirect genetic correlations were moderately to highly negative
   in crossbreds (-0.37 +/- 0.17 and -0.83 +/- 0.10), but low and not
   significantly different from zero in purebreds (-0.20 +/- 0.21 and -0.28
   +/- 0.18). Consequently, unlike purebreds, crossbreds would fail to
   respond positively to mass selection. The direct genetic correlation
   between both crosses was high (0.95 +/- 0.23), whereas the indirect
   genetic correlation was moderate (0.41 +/- 0.26). Thus, for IGEs, it
   mattered which parental line provided the sire and which provided the
   dam. This indirect parent-of-origin effect appeared to be paternally
   transmitted and is probably Z chromosome linked.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one
   individual affect the phenotype of a conspecific. Theoretical models
   indicate that the evolutionary consequences of IGEs critically depend on
   the genetic architecture of interacting traits, and on the strength and
   direction of phenotypic effects arising from social interactions, which
   can be quantified by the interaction coefficient Psi. In the context of
   sexually selected traits, strong positive Psi tends to exaggerate
   evolutionary change, whereas negative Psi impedes sexual trait
   elaboration. Despite its theoretical importance, whether and how Psi
   varies among geographically distinct populations is unknown. Such
   information is necessary to evaluate the potential for IGEs to
   contribute to divergence among isolated or semi-isolated populations.
   Here, we report substantial variation in Psi for a behavioural trait
   involved in sexual selection in the field cricket Teleogryllus
   oceanicus: female choosiness. Both the strength and direction of Psi
   varied among geographically isolated populations. Psi also changed over
   time. In a contemporary population of crickets from Kauai, experience of
   male song increased female choosiness. In contrast, experience of male
   song decreased choosiness in an ancestral population from the same
   location. This rapid change corroborates studies examining the
   evolvability of Psi and demonstrates how interpopulation variation in
   the interaction coefficient might influence sexual selection and
   accelerate divergence of traits influenced by IGEs that contribute to
   reproductive isolation in nascent species or subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{Ornaments, weapons and aggressive behaviours may evolve in female
   animals by mate choice and intrasexual competition for mating
   opportunities-the standard forms of sexual selection in males. However,
   a growing body of evidence suggests that selection tends to operate in
   different ways in males and females, with female traits more often
   mediating competition for ecological resources, rather than mate
   acquisition. Two main solutions have been proposed to accommodate this
   disparity. One is to expand the concept of sexual selection to include
   all mechanisms related to fecundity; another is to adopt an alternative
   conceptual framework-the theory of social selection-in which sexual
   selection is one component of a more general form of selection resulting
   from all social interactions. In this study, we summarize the history of
   the debate about female ornaments and weapons, and discuss potential
   resolutions. We review the components of fitness driving ornamentation
   in a wide range of systems, and show that selection often falls outside
   the limits of traditional sexual selection theory, particularly in
   females. We conclude that the evolution of these traits in both sexes is
   best understood within the unifying framework of social selection.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the evolution of altruism requires knowledge of both its
   constraints and its drivers. Here we show that, paradoxically,
   ecological constraints on altruism may ultimately be its strongest
   driver. We construct a two-trait, coevolutionary adaptive dynamics model
   of social evolution in a genetically structured population with local
   resource competition. The intensity of local resource competition, which
   influences the direction and strength of social selection and which is
   typically treated as a static parameter, is here allowed to be an
   evolvable trait. Evolution of survival/fecundity altruism, which
   requires weak local competition, increases local competition as it
   evolves, creating negative environmental feedback that ultimately
   inhibits its further evolutionary advance. Alternatively, evolution of
   resource-based altruism, which requires strong local competition,
   weakens local competition as it evolves, also ultimately causing its own
   evolution to stall. When evolving independently, these altruistic
   strategies are intrinsically self-limiting. However, the coexistence of
   these two altruism types transforms the negative ecoevolutionary
   feedback generated by each strategy on itself into positive feedback on
   the other, allowing the presence of one trait to drive the evolution of
   the other. We call this feedback conversion reciprocal niche
   construction. In the absence of constraints, this process leads to
   runaway coevolution of altruism types. We discuss applications to the
   origins and evolution of eusociality, division of labor, the inordinate
   ecological success of eusocial species, and the interaction between
   technology and demography in human evolution. Our theory suggests that
   the evolution of extreme sociality may often be an autocatalytic
   process.}},

Abstract = {{A conspicuous feature of honey bee social biology is the division of
   labour between reproductive queens and functionally sterile workers.
   However, the sterility of workers is conditional and sensitive to
   genetic and environmental context. Despite this understanding, we do not
   yet know how effective differences in genotype versus differences in
   colony environment are for generating variation in levels of ovary
   activation in a population of workers. We therefore performed a field
   study and meta-analysis to estimate the standardized effect size g of
   broad `environmental' and `genetic' manipulations on worker ovary
   scores. Despite considerable differences in methodology and treatment
   among published studies, we report that both genetic and environmental
   manipulations were effective at generating differences in ovary
   phenotype between groups of worker bees. Our analysis found that
   environmental treatments, such as differences in pheromones and diet,
   had a larger mean effect on worker ovary activation scores than have
   genetic factors such as patriline or strain (g = 0.54 vs. 0.39). We
   conclude by discussing the biological significance of environmentally
   sensitive sterility in honey bee societies.}},

   profile (through RAPD-PCR analyses) and antimicrobial properties (by
   performing antagonistic tests against ten bacterial indicator strains)
   of the different isolates obtained from the uropygial glands of hoopoe
   females and nestlings. We found that the genetic profile of bacterial
   isolates was related to antimicrobial activity, as well as to individual
   host identity and the nest from which samples were obtained. This
   association suggest that variation in the inhibitory capacity of
   Enterococci symbionts should be under selection.}},

Title = {{Maternal effects on male weaponry: female dung beetles produce major
   sons with longer horns when they perceive higher population density}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Maternal effects are environmental influences on the
   phenotype of one individual that are due to the expression of genes in
   its mother, and are expected to evolve whenever females are better
   capable of assessing the environmental conditions that their offspring
   will experience than the offspring themselves. In the dung beetle
   Onthophagus taurus, conditional male dimorphism is associated with
   alternative reproductive tactics: majors fight and guard females whereas
   minors sneak copulations. Furthermore, variation in dung beetle
   population density has different fitness consequences for each male
   morph, and theory predicts that higher population density might select
   for a higher frequency of minors and/or greater expenditure on weaponry
   in majors. Because adult dung beetles provide offspring with all the
   nutritional resources for their development, maternal effects strongly
   influence male phenotype.
   Results: Here we tested whether female O. taurus are capable of
   perceiving population density, and responding by changing the phenotype
   of their offspring. We found that mothers who were reared with other
   conspecifics in their pre-mating period produced major offspring that
   had longer horns across a wider range of body sizes than the major
   offspring of females that were reared in isolation in their pre-mating
   period. Moreover, our results indicate that this maternal effect on male
   weaponry does not operate through the amount of dung provided by females
   to their offspring, but is rather transmitted through egg or brood mass
   composition. Finally, although theory predicts that females experiencing
   higher density might produce more minor males, we found no support for
   this, rather the best fitting models were equivocal as to whether fewer
   or the same proportions of minors were produced.
   Conclusions: Our study describes a new type of maternal effect in dung
   beetles, which probably allows females to respond to population density
   adaptively, preparing at least their major offspring for the sexual
   competition they will face in the future. This new type of maternal
   effect in dung beetles represents a novel transgenerational response of
   alternative reproductive tactics to population density.}},

Title = {{Artificial selection on flowering time: influence on reproductive

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{852-861}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Flowering time is frequently under selection due to a combination of
   abiotic, biotic and intrinsic factors. Evolution in response to this
   selection is likely to have broad effects, altering not only flowering
   time but reproductive phenology and, potentially, traits throughout the
   life cycle. We know little about the broader phenotypic changes
   associated with evolutionary shifts in flowering time, and the extent to
   which expression of these changes depends on local environmental
   conditions. 2. After three generations of selection for early- and
   late-flowering, we grew plants of the herb Campanulastrum americanum in
   contrasting light environments (light gap and understorey) in its home
   population. 3. Response to selection on flowering time and correlated
   responses in reproductive phenology were expressed across light
   environments with the reproduction of early-flowering lines being over 2
   weeks ahead of late-flowering lines. Plants in the understorey delayed
   initiation of flowering but accelerated flower deployment, fruit
   maturation and the end of reproduction, resulting in a condensed
   reproductive period. 4. Timing of seed dispersal influences whether
   offspring grow as annuals or biennials in C. americanum. Because
   evolution of flowering time shifted reproductive phenology, it is likely
   to alter life history frequency. In contrast, understorey habitats both
   delayed flowering and accelerated reproductive phenology, yielding no
   expected life history change. 5. Synthesis. Evolution of flowering time
   altered the phenology of all subsequent reproductive traits and is also
   likely to affect offspring traits. This ripple effect of changes in
   flowering time indicates that it is essential to recognize genetic and
   functional linkages among traits to understand potential life cycle
   consequences of selection on a single character.}},

Abstract = {{In many traits involved in social interactions, such as courtship and
   aggression, the phenotype is an outcome of interactions between
   individuals. Such traits whose expression in an individual is partly
   determined by the phenotype of its social partner are called interacting
   phenotypes. Quantitative genetic models suggested that interacting
   phenotypes can evolve much faster than nonsocial traits. Current models,
   however, consider the interaction between phenotypes of social partners
   as a fixed phenotypic response rule, represented by an interaction
   coefficient (?). Here, we extend existing theoretical models and
   incorporate the interaction coefficient as a trait that can evolve. We
   find that the evolution of the interaction coefficient can change
   qualitatively the predictions about the rate and direction of evolution
   of interacting phenotypes. We argue that it is crucial to determine
   whether and how the phenotypic response of an individual to its social
   partner can evolve to make accurate predictions about the evolution of
   traits involved in social interactions.}},

Abstract = {{In Drosophila melanogaster, biological rhythms, aggression and mating
   are modulated by group size and composition. However, the fitness
   significance of this group effect is unknown. By varying the composition
   of groups of males and females, we show that social context affects
   reproductive behaviour and offspring genetic diversity. Firstly, females
   mating with males from the same strain in the presence of males from a
   different strain are infecund, analogous to the Bruce effect in rodents,
   suggesting a social context-dependent inbreeding avoidance mechanism.
   Secondly, females mate more frequently in groups composed of males from
   more than one strain; this mitigates last male sperm precedence and
   increases offspring genetic diversity. However, smell-impaired Orco
   mutant females do not increase mating frequency according to group
   composition; this indicates that social context-dependent changes in
   reproductive behaviour depend on female olfaction, rather than direct
   male-male interactions. Further, variation in mating frequency in
   wild-type strains depends on females and not males. The data show that
   group composition can affect variance in the reproductive success of its
   members, and that females play a central role in this process. Social
   environment can thus influence the evolutionary process.}},

Abstract = {{The refutation of `soft' inheritance and establishment of Mendelian
   genetics as the exclusive model of heredity is widely portrayed as an
   iconic success story of scientific progress. Yet, we are witnessing a
   re-emergence of debate on the role of soft inheritance in heredity and
   evolution. I argue that this reversal reflects not only the weight of
   new evidence but also an important conceptual change. I show that the
   concept of soft inheritance rejected by 20th-century genetics differs
   fundamentally from the current concept of `nongenetic inheritance'.
   Moreover, whereas it has long been assumed that heredity is mediated by
   a single, universal mechanism, a pluralistic model of heredity is now
   emerging, based on a recognition of multiple, parallel mechanisms of
   inheritance.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The Price equation partitions total evolutionary change into two
   components. The first component provides an abstract expression of
   natural selection. The second component subsumes all other evolutionary
   processes, including changes during transmission. The natural selection
   component is often used in applications. Those applications attract
   widespread interest for their simplicity of expression and ease of
   interpretation. Those same applications attract widespread criticism by
   dropping the second component of evolutionary change and by leaving
   unspecified the detailed assumptions needed for a complete study of
   dynamics. Controversies over approximation and dynamics have nothing to
   do with the Price equation itself, which is simply a mathematical
   equivalence relation for total evolutionary change expressed in an
   alternative form. Disagreements about approach have to do with the
   tension between the relative valuation of abstract versus concrete
   analyses. The Price equation's greatest value has been on the abstract
   side, particularly the invariance relations that illuminate the
   understanding of natural selection. Those abstract insights lay the
   foundation for applications in terms of kin selection, information
   theory interpretations of natural selection and partitions of causes by
   path analysis. I discuss recent critiques of the Price equation by Nowak
   and van Veelen.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships among the members of a population can be visualized
   using individual networks, where each individual is a node connected to
   each other by means of links describing the interactions. The centrality
   of a given node captures its importance within the network. We
   hypothesize that in mutualistic networks, the centrality of a node
   should benefit its fitness. We test this idea studying eight
   individual-based networks originated from the interaction between
   Erysimum mediohispanicum and its flower visitors. In these networks,
   each plant was considered a node and was connected to conspecifics
   sharing flower visitors. Centrality indicates how well connected is a
   given E. mediohispanicum individual with the rest of the co-occurring
   conspecifics because of sharing flower visitors. The centrality was
   estimated by three network metrics: betweenness, closeness and degree.
   The complex relationship between centrality, phenotype and fitness was
   explored by structural equation modelling. We found that the centrality
   of a plant was related to its fitness, with plants occupying central
   positions having higher fitness than those occupying peripheral
   positions. The structural equation models (SEMs) indicated that the
   centrality effect on fitness was not merely an effect of the abundance
   of visits and the species richness of visitors. Centrality has an effect
   even when simultaneously accounting for these predictors. The SEMs also
   indicated that the centrality effect on fitness was because of the
   specific phenotype of each plant, with attractive plants occupying
   central positions in networks, in relation to the distribution of
   conspecific phenotypes. This finding suggests that centrality, owing to
   its dependence on social interactions, may be an appropriate surrogate
   for the interacting phenotype of individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Great progress has been made in understanding the genetic architecture
   of phenotypic variation, but it is almost entirely focused on how the
   genotype of an individual affects the phenotype of that same individual.
   However, in many species the genotype of the mother is a major
   determinant of the phenotype of her offspring. Therefore, a complete
   picture of genetic architecture must include these maternal genetic
   effects, but they can be difficult to identify because maternal and
   offspring genotypes are correlated and therefore, partially confounded.
   We present a conceptual framework that overcomes this challenge to
   separate direct and maternal effects in intact families through an
   analysis that we call ``statistical cross-fostering.{''} Our approach
   combines genotype data from mothers and their offspring to remove the
   confounding effects of the offspring's own genotype on measures of
   maternal genetic effects. We formalize our approach in an orthogonal
   model and apply this model to an experimental population of mice. We
   identify a set of six maternal genetic effect loci that explain a
   substantial portion of variation in body size at all ages. This
   variation would be missed in an approach focused solely on direct
   genetic effects, but is clearly a major component of genetic
   architecture. Our approach can easily be adapted to examine maternal
   effects in different systems, and because it does not require
   experimental manipulation, it provides a framework that can be used to
   understand the contribution of maternal genetic effects in both natural
   and experimental populations.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Whether to reproduce once or multiple times (semelparity vs.
   iteroparity) is a major life-history decision that organisms have to
   take. Mode of parity is usually considered a species characteristic.
   However, recent models suggested that population properties or
   condition-dependent fitness payoffs could help to maintain both
   life-history tactics within populations. In arthropods, semelparity was
   also hypothesised to be a critical pre-adaptation for the evolution of
   maternal care, semelparous females being predicted to provide more care
   due to the absence of costs on future reproduction. The aim of this
   study was to characterize potential fitness payoffs and levels of
   maternal care in semel- and itero-parous females of the European earwig
   Forficula auricularia. Based on 15 traits measured in 494 females and
   their nymphs, our results revealed that iteroparous females laid their
   first clutch earlier, had more eggs in their first clutch, gained more
   weight during the 2 weeks following hatching of the first clutch, but
   produced eggs that developed more slowly than semelparous females. Among
   iteroparous females, the sizes of first and second clutches were
   significantly and positively correlated, indicating no investment
   trade-off between reproductive events. Iteroparous females also provided
   more food than semelparous ones, a result contrasting with predictions
   that iteroparity is incompatible with the evolution of maternal care.
   Finally, a controlled breeding experiment reported full mating
   compatibility among offspring from females of the two modes of parity,
   confirming that both types of females belong to one single species.
   Overall, these results indicate that alternative modes of parity
   represent coexisting life-history tactics that are likely to be
   condition-dependent and associated with offspring development and
   specific levels of maternal care in earwigs.}},

Abstract = {{An approach frequently used to demonstrate a genetic basis for

   rearing designs, where observed differences are assumed to be
   attributable to primarily additive genetic effects. Here, in two common
   garden experiments, we employed factorial breeding designs between wild
   and domestic, and among wild populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus

   (VM) effects to the observed population differences for 17 life history
   and fitness-related traits. Our results show that, in general, maternal
   effects contribute more to phenotypic differences among populations than
   additive genetic effects. These results suggest that maternal effects
   are important in population phenotypic differentiation and also signify
   that the inclusion of the maternal source of variation is critical when
   employing models to test population differences in salmon, such as in

   life-history trade-off reconsidered}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 31}},
Abstract = {{Background: To maximize their fitness, parents are assumed to allocate
   their resources optimally between number and size of offspring. Although
   this fundamental life-history trade-off has been subject to long
   standing interest, its genetic basis, especially in wild mammals, still
   remains unresolved. One important reason for this problem is that a
   large multigenerational pedigree is required to conduct a reliable
   analysis of this trade-off.
   Results: We used the REML-animal model to estimate genetic parameters
   for litter size and individual birth size for a common Palearctic small
   mammal, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Even though a phenotypic
   trade-off between offspring number and size was evident, it was not
   explained by a genetic trade-off, but rather by negative correlations in
   permanent and temporary environmental effects. In fact, even positive
   genetic correlations were estimated between direct genetic effects for
   offspring number and size indicating that genetic variation in these two
   traits is not necessarily antagonistic in mammals.
   Conclusions: Our results have notable implications for the study of the
   life-history trade-off between offspring number and size in mammals. The
   estimated genetic correlations suggest that evolution of offspring
   number and size in polytocous mammals is not constrained by the
   trade-off caused by antagonistic selection responses per se, but rather
   by the opposing correlative selection responses in direct and maternal
   genetic effects for birth size.}},

Abstract = {{The phenotype of social animals can be influenced by genetic, maternal
   and environmental effects, which include social interactions during
   development. In social insects, the social environment and genetic
   origin of brood can each influence a whole suite of traits, from
   individual size to caste differentiation. Here, we investigate to which
   degree the social environment during development affects the survival
   and fungal resistance of ant brood of known maternal origin. We
   manipulated one component of the social environment, the worker/brood
   ratio, of brood originating from single queens of Formica selysi. We
   monitored the survival of brood and measured the head size and ability
   to resist the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana of the
   resulting callow workers. The worker/brood ratio and origin of eggs
   affected the survival and maturation time of the brood and the size of
   the resulting callow workers. The survival of the callow workers varied
   greatly according to their origin, both in controls and when challenged
   with B. bassiana. However, there was no interaction between the fungal
   challenge and either the worker/brood ratio or origin of eggs,
   suggesting that these factors did not affect parasite resistance in the
   conditions tested. Overall, the social conditions during brood rearing
   and the origin of eggs had a strong impact on brood traits that are
   important for fitness. We detected a surprisingly large amount of
   variation among queens in the survival of their brood reared in standard
   queenless conditions, which calls for further studies on genetic,
   maternal and social effects influencing brood development in the social
   insects.}},

Abstract = {{Past evolution determines the genetically determined available
   phenotypes in populations which affect ecological dynamics in
   communities, shaping in turn the selective pressures that further model
   phenotypes. Because an increase in temperature increases metabolic rates
   and encounter rates, climate change may have profound eco-evolutionary
   effects, possibly affecting the future persistence and functioning of
   food webs. We introduce a semi-spatially explicit individual-based model
   (IBM) framework to study functional eco-evolutionary dynamics in food
   webs. Each species embedded in the web includes 13 genetically
   determined and multidimensionally variable traits (the G matrix), 4 of
   which are flexible physiological and behavioural (personality) traits
   that respond to temperature. An increase in temperature and stronger
   correlation among traits leads to stronger trophic cascades but higher
   stochasticity, with higher probability of extinction for some trophic
   levels. A combination of the abiotic (temperature) and biotic
   (predators' presence/absence) matrix of selective agents (the O matrix)
   generates differential selection for activation energies for metabolic
   rates and several instances of correlational selection (selection in one
   trait changes with the levels of another), suggesting how global warming
   might favour certain trait combinations. Our results and the future
   prospects of this IBM approach open new avenues for climate change
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Intra- and interspecific plantplant interactions are fundamental to
   patterns of community assembly and to the mixture effects observed in
   biodiversity studies. Although much research has been conducted at the
   species level, very little is understood about how genetic variation
   within and among interacting species may drive these processes. Using
   clones of both Solidago altissima and Solidago gigantea, we found that
   genotypic variation in a plants neighbours affected both above- and
   belowground plant traits, and that genotype by genotype interactions
   between neighbouring plants impacted associated pollinator communities.
   The traits for which focal plant genotypic variation explained the most
   variation varied by plant species, whereas neighbour genotypic variation
   explained the most variation in coarse root biomass. Our results provide
   new insight into genotypic and species diversity effects in
   plantneighbour interactions, the extended consequences of diversity
   effects, and the potential for evolution in response to competitive or
   to facilitative plantneighbour interactions.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-19}},

Abstract = {{In a model based on the wasp family Vespidae, the origin of worker
   behaviour, which constitutes the eusociality threshold, is not based on
   relatedness, therefore the origin of eusociality does not depend on
   inclusive fitness, and workers at the eusociality threshold are not
   altruistic. Instead, incipient workers and queens behave selfishly and
   are subject to direct natural selection. Beyond the eusociality
   threshold, relatedness enables soft inheritance as the framework for
   initial adaptations of eusociality. At the threshold of irreversibility,
   queen and worker castes become fixed in advanced eusociality.
   Transitions from solitary to facultative, facultative to primitive, and
   primitive to advanced eusociality occur via exaptation, phenotypic
   accommodation and genetic assimilation. Multilevel selection
   characterizes the solitary to highly eusocial transition, but components
   of multilevel selection vary across levels of eusociality. Roles of
   behavioural flexibility and developmental plasticity in the evolutionary
   process equal or exceed those of genotype.}},

Abstract = {{Trade-offs occur when two traits have opposing fitness effects such that
   positive selection on one trait is constrained by the negative fitness
   consequences of the other trait. To understand why trade-off may arise
   we need to study the genetic and non-genetic factors that influence
   associated traits because these may respond differently to selective
   pressure. Research into trade-offs has largely focused on the genetic
   basis of associated traits, yet both maternal effects and epigenetic
   effects have recently been shown to affect life history traits that play
   a role in trade-offs. In this study, we analyze genetic, epigenetic and
   life-history predictors of one of the most important trade-offs, that
   between offspring number and offspring mortality. Using a large-scale
   3-generational intercross between two divergent mouse lines C57BL/6J and
   DBA/2J, we show that litter size differences between these lines,
   although significant, are surprisingly not the most important predictors
   of mortality. Offspring genotype, maternal effects and their
   interactions are the most influential factors determining mortality. We
   found significant paternal effects suggesting an important influence of
   paternal care or potentially the role of imprinted genes. Perhaps
   contrary to expectations our results further show that the trade-off
   between offspring number and mortality is not just a simple function of
   the two factors yielding, on average, an `optimal' litter size at
   weaning. Indeed if one focused on litter size and mortality alone, the
   slope of relationship is the same for the two lines, yet they differ in
   the number of young at weaning. Our study reveals that a perceived
   trade-off between two traits is governed by a more complex set of
   interactions between genetic and non-genetic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic selection is a major force shaping life on earth. In classical
   genetic theory, response to selection is the product of the strength of
   selection and the additive genetic variance in a trait. The additive
   genetic variance reflects a population's intrinsic potential to respond
   to selection. The ordinary additive genetic variance, however, ignores
   the social organization of life. With social interactions among
   individuals, individual trait values may depend on genes in others, a
   phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects. Models accounting for
   indirect genetic effects, however, lack a general definition of
   heritable variation. Here I propose a general definition of the
   heritable variation that determines the potential of a population to
   respond to selection. This generalizes the concept of heritable variance
   to any inheritance model and level of organization. The result shows
   that heritable variance determining potential response to selection is
   the variance among individuals in the heritable quantity that determines
   the population mean trait value, rather than the usual additive genetic
   component of phenotypic variance. It follows, therefore, that heritable
   variance may exceed phenotypic variance among individuals, which is
   impossible in classical theory. This work also provides a measure of the
   utilization of heritable variation for response to selection and
   integrates two well-known models of maternal genetic effects. The result
   shows that relatedness between the focal individual and the individuals
   affecting its fitness is a key determinant of the utilization of
   heritable variance for response to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Mothers are often the most important determinant of traits expressed by
   their offspring. These ``maternal effects{''} (MEs) are especially
   crucial in early development, but can also persist into adulthood. They
   have been shown to play a role in a diversity of evolutionary and
   ecological processes, especially when genetically based. Although the
   importance of MEs is becoming widely appreciated, we know little about
   their underlying genetic basis. We address the dearth of genetic data by
   providing a simple approach, using combined genotype information from
   parents and offspring, to identify ``maternal genetic effects{''} (MGEs)
   contributing to natural variation in complex traits. Combined with
   experimental cross-fostering, our approach also allows for the
   separation of pre- and postnatal MGEs, providing rare insights into
   prenatal effects. Applying this approach to an experimental mouse
   population, we identified 13 ME loci affecting body weight, most of
   which (12/13) exhibited prenatal effects, and nearly half (6/13)
   exhibiting postnatal effects. MGEs contributed more to variation in body
   weight than the direct effects of the offsprings' own genotypes until
   mice reached adulthood, but continued to represent a major component of
   variation through adulthood. Prenatal effects always contributed more
   variation than postnatal effects, especially for those effects that
   persisted into adulthood. These results suggest that MGEs may be an
   important component of genetic architecture that is generally overlooked
   in studies focused on direct mapping from genotype to phenotype. Our
   approach can be used in both experimental and natural populations,
   providing a widely practicable means of expanding our understanding of
   MGEs.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of infectious disease is increasingly recognized to be
   impacted by maternal effects, where the environmental conditions
   experienced by mothers alter resistance to infection in offspring,
   independent of heritability. Here, we studied how maternal effects (high
   or low food availability to mothers) mediated the resistance of the
   crustacean Daphnia magna to its bacterial parasite Pasteuria ramosa. We
   sought to disentangle maternal effects from the effects of host genetic
   background by studying how maternal effects varied across 24 host
   genotypes sampled from a natural population. Under low-food conditions,
   females produced offspring that were relatively resistant, but this
   maternal effect varied strikingly between host genotypes, i.e. there
   were genotype by maternal environment interactions. As infection with
   P.ramosa causes a substantial reduction in host fecundity, this maternal
   effect had a large effect on host fitness. Maternal effects were also
   shown to impact parasite fitness, both because they prevented the
   establishment of the parasites and because even when parasites did
   establish in the offspring of poorly fed mothers, and they tended to
   grow more slowly. These effects indicate that food stress in the
   maternal generation can greatly influence parasite susceptibility and
   thus perhaps the evolution and coevolution of host similar to parasite
   interactions.}},

Title = {{Maternal effects mediated by egg quality in the Yellow-legged Gull Larus
   michahellis in relation to laying order and embryo sex}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Maternal effects mediated by egg size and quality may
   profoundly affect offspring development and performance, and mothers may
   adjust egg traits according to environmental or social influences. In
   avian species, context-dependency of maternal effects may result in
   variation in egg composition, as well as in differential patterns of
   covariation among selected egg components, according to, for example,
   position in the laying sequence or offspring sex. We investigated
   variation in major classes of egg yolk components (carotenoids, vitamins
   and steroid hormones) in relation to egg size, position in the laying
   sequence and embryo sex in clutches of the Yellow-legged Gull (Larus
   michahellis). We also investigated their covariation, to highlight
   mutual adjustments, maternal constraints or trade-offs in egg
   allocation.
   Results: Laying sequence-specific patterns of allocation emerged:
   concentration of carotenoids and vitamin E decreased, while
   concentrations of androgens increased. Vitamin A, estradiol and
   corticosterone did not show any change. There was no evidence of
   sex-specific allocation or covariation of yolk components.
   Concentrations of carotenoids and vitamins were positively correlated.
   Egg mass decreased along the laying sequence, and this decrease was
   negatively correlated with the mean concentrations of carotenoids in
   clutches, suggesting that nutritionally constrained females lay low
   quality clutches in terms of carotenoid content. Finally, clutches with
   smaller decline in antioxidants between first-and last-laid eggs had a
   larger increase in yolk corticosterone, suggesting that a smaller
   antioxidant depletion along the laying sequence may entail a cost for
   laying females in terms of increased stress levels.
   Conclusions: Since some of the analyzed yolk components (e. g.
   testosterone and lutein) are known to exert sex-specific phenotypic
   effects on the progeny in this species, the lack of sex-specific egg
   allocation by mothers may either result from trade-offs between
   contrasting effects of different egg components on male and female
   offspring, or indicate that sex-specific traits are controlled primarily
   by mechanisms of sexual differentiation, including endogenous hormone
   production or metabolism of exogenous antioxidants, during embryonic
   development.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work we report evidence compatible with a maternal effect
   allele affecting left-right development and functional lateralization in
   vertebrates. Our study demonstrates that the increased frequency of
   reversed brain asymmetries in a zebrafish line isolated through a
   behavioral assay is due to selection of mother-of-snow-white (msw), a
   maternal effect allele involved in early stages of left-right
   development in zebrafish. msw homozygous females could be identified by
   screening of their progeny for the position of the parapineal organ
   because in about 50\% of their offspring we found an altered, either
   bilateral or right-sided, expression of lefty1 and spaw. Deeper
   investigations at earlier stages of development revealed that msw is
   involved in the specification and differentiation of precursors of the
   Kupffer's vesicle, a structure homologous to the mammalian node. To test
   the hypothesis that msw, by controlling Kupffer's vesicle morphogenesis,
   controls lateralized behaviors related to diencephalic asymmetries, we
   analyzed left-and right-parapineal offspring in a ``viewing test''. As a
   result, left-and right-parapineal individuals showed opposite and
   complementary eye preference when scrutinizing a model predator, and a
   different degree of lateralization when scrutinizing a virtual
   companion. As maternal effect genes are expected to evolve more rapidly
   when compared to zygotic ones, our results highlight the driving force
   of maternal effect alleles in the evolution of vertebrates behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{Studying the genetics of host shifts and range expansions in
   phytophagous insects contributes to our understanding of the evolution
   of host plant adaptation. We investigated the recent host range
   expansion to pea, in the pea-adapted strain (P-strain) of the
   crucifer-specialist diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera:
   Plutellidae). Larval survivorship on the novel host plant pea and a
   typical crucifer host (kale) was measured in reciprocal F(1), F(2) and
   backcrosses between the P-strain and a strain reared only on crucifers
   (C-strain). Reciprocal F(1) hybrids differed: offspring from P-strain
   mothers survived better on pea, indicating a maternal effect. However,
   no evidence for sex-linkage was found. Backcrosses to the P-strain
   produced higher survivorship on pea than C-strain backcrosses,
   suggesting recessive inheritance. In a linkage analysis with amplified
   fragment length polymorphism markers using P-strain backcrosses, two,
   four and five linkage groups contributing to survival on pea were
   identified in three different families respectively, indicating
   oligogenic inheritance. Thus, the newly evolved ability to survive on
   pea has a complex genetic basis, and the P-strain is still genetically
   heterogeneous and not yet fixed for all the alleles enabling it to
   survive on pea. Survivorship on kale was variable, but not related to
   survivorship on pea. This pattern may characterize the genetic
   inheritance of early host plant adaptation in oligophagous insect

Abstract = {{Social interactions often have major fitness consequences, but little is
   known about how specific interacting phenotypes affect the strength of
   natural selection. Social influences on the evolutionary process can be
   assessed using a multilevel selection approach that partitions the
   effects of social partner phenotypes on fitness (referred to as social
   or group selection) from those of the traits of a focal individual
   (nonsocial or individual selection). To quantify the contribution of
   social selection to total selection affecting a trait, the patterns of
   phenotypic association among interactants must also be considered. We
   estimated selection gradients on male body size in a wild population of
   forked fungus beetles (Bolitotherus cornutus). We detected positive
   nonsocial selection and negative social selection on body size operating
   through differences in copulation success, indicating that large males
   with small social partners had highest fitness. In addition, we found
   that, in low-density demes, the phenotypes of focal individuals were
   negatively correlated with those of their social partners. This pattern
   reversed the negative effect of group selection on body size and led to
   stronger positive selection for body size. Our results demonstrate
   multilevel selection in nature and stress the importance of considering
   social selection whenever conspecific interactions occur nonrandomly.}},

Abstract = {{Relatively few investigations explicitly test for concordant versus
   conflicting selection pressures from intrasexual versus intersexual
   selection. Here, we examine the effects of male body mass and behavioral
   type (BT) on reproductive success in the spider Anelosimus studiosus,
   with emphasis placed on the potential interaction between intrasexual
   and intersexual selection influences. Female A. studiosus exhibit either
   an aggressive-active or docile-passive BT, both of which co-occur in
   multifemale colonies. Males, in contrast, exhibit a more continuous
   distribution of behavioral tendencies. We investigated the male traits
   favored by females in five trial types: one docile female, one
   aggressive female, four docile females, four aggressive females, and two
   docile and two aggressive females. Male reproductive success was
   estimated by the number eggs produced by females following staged mating
   trials. In previous work, it was established that large aggressive males
   are favored in male male contests, an intrasexual effect. However, large
   aggressive males were not universally favored here. We failed to detect
   an effect of male body mass or aggressiveness on reproductive success in
   trials with all docile females; however, in situations involving
   aggressive females, large aggressive males experienced diminished
   reproductive success relative to small docile males. Large, aggressive
   males were also more likely to be attacked and killed by aggressive
   females in the first 20 min of staged encounters and were more likely to
   be found dead after 72 h of unobserved interactions. Taken together, our
   data suggest that the reproductive consequences of male traits differ
   based on (1) the aspect of sexual selection being considered
   (intrasexual versus intersexual) and (2) the BT of their prospective
   mates: large aggressive males enjoy advantages in intrasexual selection
   and when courting docile females and small docile males experience
   reduced risk of cannibalism and increased reproductive success with
   aggressive females.}},

Abstract = {{Harmful social behaviours are prevalent in commercial farming
   environments and their reduction through economically feasible husbandry
   changes is challenging. Selective breeding may offer a complementary
   approach to reduce the expression of these traits. This article explores
   the progress made in estimating the genetic contribution to harmful
   social behaviours, the likely consequences of selection on these for
   production or welfare relevant traits, and the barriers that constrain
   uptake of selection and how these may be overcome. Significant but often
   low heritabilities have been reported for all of the major harmful
   social behavioural traits which may reflect the difficulty of their
   measurement (pig aggression 0.04-0.43, tail biting 0.05-0.27 and
   savaging of piglets 0.02-0.9: feather pecking in layers 0.11-0.20). The
   need for sensitive, easily measured indicators of the likelihood of
   showing harmful behaviour and estimation of the economic and
   non-economic benefits of reducing the expression of these traits remain
   significant constraints to their selection. Routine genotyping and the
   use of this information for genome-wide selection is advancing rapidly
   for some species. This methodology is particularly attractive for traits
   that are difficult or costly to measure and may provide a way of
   selecting against harmful social behaviours. However, past selection on
   economic traits may have contributed to the expression of harmful
   behaviours which could be accelerated by the use of genomic information
   to more rapidly improve economic traits. Genome-wide selection therefore
   poses both a threat to welfare and significant possibilities to improve
   welfare depending on how it is used. Alternatively, selection on
   associative effects could allow the development of animals that coexist
   without depressing the growth performance of group members. As effects
   on group member growth probably operate through social interactions,
   this may offer an alternative route through which social behaviour can
   be improved without the need for behavioural phenotyping. Understanding
   precisely how behaviour will be affected by this approach is crucial and
   now beginning. Harmful social behaviours ought to respond to selection,
   albeit slowly, and are the kind of trait likely to benefit most from the
   carefully managed use of emerging breeding methods, with potential
   benefits for welfare. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY OF FRESHWATER FISH}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{328-345}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Quantitative genetic techniques are contributing greatly to our
   understanding of evolutionary processes in the wild. However, the vast
   majority of applications of quantitative genetic methodologies to
   natural populations have been conducted in very narrow ranges of the
   `life history space' expressed by organisms in nature. Recent and
   ongoing technological and analytical advances are making expansion of
   the taxonomic scope of such studies both possible and highly desirable.
   I review a number of ways in which fishes can be exploited to better
   understand the phenotypic expression of genetic variation in the wild.
   In particular, I argue that the culturability of fishes can be exploited
   in the execution of study designs where pedigrees can be manipulated,
   while maintaining the ecological relevance of phenotypic and genetic
   variation as expressed in the wild. In general, the model organisms
   which are currently most intensively studied in a quantitative genetic
   framework in the wild are not easily culturable. Thus, at least among
   vertebrates, the proposed approaches are uniquely suited to fishes. I
   highlight how fishes may provide particularly good models with which to
   study the genetic basis of variation in phenotypic plasticity, the
   genetic basis of the environmental dependence of genetic parameters and
   to detect adaptive phenotypic microevolution.}},

Title = {{Maternal and paternal contributions to egg size and egg number variation
   in the blackfin pearl killifish Austrolebias nigripinnis}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Reproductive effort, egg number and egg size are traditionally
   considered to be `female' life history traits. However, females often
   adjust the amount of resources allocated to reproduction depending on
   their mate, causing male environmental effects on life history traits.
   If females respond to male traits which are genetically variable, then
   male environmental effects contain indirect genetic effects. Estimates
   of how much of the total variation in life history traits originates
   from female effects versus male environmental effects, seems mostly
   lacking. We have investigated variation in rates of egg production and
   in egg size in the annual Argentinian blackfin pearl killifish
   Austrolebias nigripinnis, in a crossed design where males were exchanged
   repeatedly between females. Our analysis of phenotypic variance
   components of reproductive effort, egg size and egg number indicates
   that the amount of variation contributed by male environmental effects
   is equal (egg size, reproductive effort) or larger (egg number) than
   that between females. For egg size and number, we find that male
   environmental effects consist of a male random effect representing the
   average response of females to male phenotype, plus a female-male
   interaction term. This term can be understood as the deviation from the
   population mean of an individual female's response. For reproductive
   effort, we find that the male environmental effect consists of an
   interaction term only. Random effects on egg size and number
   additionally vary in magnitude depending on the weekday where we
   collected eggs, probably due to cyclic variation in experimental
   conditions. Since we find that both male phenotype and environmental
   conditions affect egg size and number as determined by females, our
   results suggest that selection on these life history traits will be
   frequency-dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Selection has led to the evolution of a variety of different mating
   strategies, each adapted to different competitive challenges. But what
   happens if the competitive challenges depend on the social environment?
   Here we discuss and review examples of socially cued anticipatory
   plasticity: irreversible developmental tactics in which resource
   allocation during the juvenile stage is altered to develop an
   appropriate phenotype for the competitive or mate choice environment
   that an individual encounters when mature. There are numerous
   theoretical and empirical examinations of the role of the social
   environment on the strength and direction of selection. However only a
   handful of empirical studies examine how the social environment affects
   juvenile allocation and whether such tactics are adaptive. The goal of
   this review is to synthesize current knowledge about socially cued
   anticipatory plasticity, including the sensory modalities that
   individuals use to predict the adult competitive and mating environment.
   We then outline the various factors that are necessary for the evolution
   of socially cued anticipatory plasticity and discuss how this can affect
   phenotypic evolution.. We conclude by suggesting some directions that
   future studies should take in order to understand how social variation
   can alter selection and the evolution of development.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of yolk androgens on postnatal growth of offspring have been
   widely studied but their physiological role in the growth control is not
   fully understood due to an inconsistency in obtained results. We
   investigated androgen-mediated maternal effects on postnatal growth in
   relation to endocrine control mechanisms using two lines of Japanese
   quail divergently selected for high (HET) and low (LET) egg testosterone
   (T) content. Embryonic growth did not differ between the lines. During
   the growth period HET quail were heavier and displayed longer tarsi as
   compared with LET quail, with more pronounced line differences in males
   than females. HET males were heavier than LET males from the age of 2
   weeks, reached the age of maximum growth rate earlier, and displayed
   higher asymptotic body weight than LET males. Accelerated growth in HET
   males was not accompanied by increased postembryonic plasma T
   concentrations. Plasma triiodothyronine levels did not differ between
   lines while plasma thyroxine levels were decreased in HET as compared
   with LET female chicks. Line differences in body weight disappeared in
   adult quail suggesting that yolk androgens, increased in a physiological
   way, resulted in stimulation of juvenile growth rate in precocial
   Japanese quail under stable social and environmental conditions. (c)

Abstract = {{Gene-environment correlation (rGE) occurs when an individual's genotype
   determines its choice of environment, generating a correlation between
   environment and genotype frequency. In particular, social rGE, caused by
   genetic variation in social environment choice, can critically determine
   both individual development and the course of social selection. Despite
   its foundational role in social evolution and developmental psychology
   theory, natural genetic variation in social environment choice has
   scarcely been examined empirically. Drosophila melanogaster provides an
   ideal system for investigating social rGE. Flies live socially in nature
   and have many opportunities to make social decisions; and natural,
   heterozygous genotypes may be replicated, enabling comparisons between
   genotypes across environments. Using this approach, I show that all
   aspects of social environment choice vary among natural genotypes,
   demonstrating pervasive social rGE. Surprisingly, genetic variation in
   group-size preference was density dependent, indicating that the
   behavioral and evolutionary consequences of rGE may depend on the
   context in which social decisions are made. These results provide the
   first detailed investigation of social rGE, and illustrate that that
   genetic variation may influence organismal performance by specifying the
   environment in which traits are expressed.}},

Abstract = {{Inheritance-the influence of ancestors on the phenotypes of their
   descendants-translates natural selection into evolutionary change. For
   the past century, inheritance has been conceptualized almost exclusively
   as the transmission of DNA sequence variation from parents to offspring
   in accordance with Mendelian rules, but advances in cell and
   developmental biology have now revealed a rich array of inheritance
   mechanisms. This empirical evidence calls for a unified conception of
   inheritance that combines genetic and nongenetic mechanisms and
   encompasses the known range of transgenerational effects, including the
   transmission of genetic and epigenetic variation, the transmission of
   plastic phenotypes (acquired traits), and the effects of parental
   environment and genotype on offspring phenotype. We propose a unified
   theoretical framework based on the Price equation that can be used to
   model evolution under an expanded inheritance concept that combines the
   effects of genetic and nongenetic inheritance. To illustrate the utility
   and generality of this framework, we show how it can be applied to a
   variety of scenarios, including nontransmissible environmental noise,
   maternal effects, indirect genetic effects, transgenerational epigenetic
   inheritance, RNA-mediated inheritance, and cultural inheritance.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal variation in selection can be generated by temporal variation
   in either the fitness surface or phenotypic distributions around a

   distributions over 2 years to investigate the causes of temporal
   variation in the form of sexual selection on body size in the damselfly
   Enallagma aspersum. Within a year, when the average female body size
   differed substantially from the average male body size, male body size
   experienced directional selection. In contrast, when male and female
   size distributions overlapped, male body size experienced stabilizing
   selection when variances in body size were large, but no appreciable
   selection when the variances in body size were small. The causes of
   temporal variation in the form of selection can only be inferred by
   accounting for changes in both the fitness surface and changes in the

Abstract = {{Recognition of relatives is often crucial for adaptive social behavior,
   but availability of recognition cues may limit adaptation. Social insect
   workers direct altruism toward relatives through nest mate recognition.
   We studied whether genetic diversity increases nest mate recognition cue
   diversity and weakens nest mate recognition behavior in the ant Formica
   fusca that has both multiple and single queen societies in sympatric
   populations. Despite larger genetic diversity in multiple queen than
   single queen colonies, we found no differences in chemical recognition
   cue diversity or aggression toward non-nest mates in behavioral
   bioassays. The results suggest that the relationship between individual
   genotypes and the colony chemical phenotype is a complex interaction of
   genes and the environment, including the social setting of the colony
   and that increase in genetic diversity does not increase cue diversity
   to levels that would cause informational constraints on recognition
   behavior in the species.}},

   methods that quantify the relative contributions of genetic and

Abstract = {{In many animal species, embryos are exposed to maternal hormones that
   affect their development. Maternal hormone transfer varies with
   environmental conditions of the mother and is often interpreted as being
   shaped by natural selection to adjust the offspring to prevailing
   environmental conditions. Such hormone transfer requires genetic
   variability, which has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. Our
   study reports direct evidence for additive genetic variance of maternal
   androgens through a bidirectional selection on yolk testosterone (T)
   levels in Japanese quail. Lines selected for high egg T (HET) and low
   egg T (LET) concentration differed in yolk levels of this androgen,
   resulting in high realized heritability (h(2) = 0.42). Correlated
   responses to selection on other gonadal hormones indicated that
   selection specifically targeted biologically active androgens. Eggs of
   HET quail contained higher androstenedione and lower estradiol
   concentrations than did those of LET quail, with no line differences in
   yolk progesterone concentration. Plasma T concentrations in adult
   females were not affected by selection, seriously challenging the
   hypothesis that transfer of maternal hormones to offspring is
   constrained by hormone levels in a mother's circulation. Our results
   suggest that transfer of maternal T represents an indirect genetic
   effect that has important consequences for the evolution of traits in
   offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence indicates that grassland community structure and species
   diversity are influenced by genetic variation within species. We review
   what is known regarding the impact of intraspecific diversity on
   grassland community structure, using an ancient limestone pasture as a
   focal example. Two genotype-dependent effects appear to modify community
   structure in this system. First, the abundance of individual constituent
   species can depend upon the combined influence of direct genetic effects
   stemming from individuals within the population. Second, the outcome of
   localized interspecific interactions occurring within the community can
   depend on the genotypes of participating individuals (indicating
   indirect genetic effects). Only genotypic interactions are thought to be
   capable of allowing the long-term coexistence of both genotypes and
   species. We discuss the implications of these effects for the
   maintenance of diversity in grasslands. Next, we present new
   observations indicating that losses of genotypic diversity from each of
   two species can be predicted by the abundance of other coexisting
   species within experimental grassland communities. These results suggest
   genotype-specific responses to abundance in other coexisting species. We
   conclude that both direct and indirect genetic effects are likely to
   shape community structure and species coexistence in grasslands,
   implying tight linkage between fine-scale genetic and community
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Studying the genetic basis of traits involved in ecological interactions
   is a fundamental part of elucidating the connections between
   evolutionary and ecological processes. Such knowledge allows one to link
   genetic models of trait evolution with ecological models describing
   interactions within and between species. Previous work has shown that
   connections between genetic and ecological processes in Arabidopsis
   thaliana may be mediated by the fact that quantitative trait loci (QTL)
   with `direct' effects on traits of individuals also have pleiotropic
   `indirect' effects on traits expressed in neighbouring plants. Here, we
   further explore these connections by examining functional relationships
   between traits affected directly and indirectly by the same QTL. We
   develop a novel approach using structural equation models (SEMs) to
   determine whether observed pleiotropic effects result from traits
   directly affected by the QTL in focal individuals causing the changes in
   the neighbours' phenotypes. This hypothesis was assessed using SEMs to
   test whether focal plant phenotypes appear to mediate the connection
   between the focal plants' genotypes and the phenotypes of their
   neighbours, or alternatively, whether the connection between the focal
   plants' genotypes and the neighbours' phenotypes is mediated by
   unmeasured traits. We implement this analysis using a QTL of major
   effect that maps to the well-characterized flowering locus, FRIGIDA. The
   SEMs support the hypothesis that the pleiotropic indirect effects of
   this locus arise from size and developmental timing-related traits in
   focal plants affecting the expression of developmental traits in their
   neighbours. Our findings provide empirical insights into the genetics
   and nature of intraspecific ecological interactions. Our technique holds
   promise in directing future work into the genetic basis and functional
   relationship of traits mediating and responding to ecological
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{A metacommunity can be defined as a set of communities that are linked
   by migration, and extinction and recolonization. In metacommunities,
   evolution can occur not only by processes that occur within communities
   such as drift and individual selection, but also by among-community
   processes, such as divergent selection owing to random differences among
   communities in species composition, and group and community-level
   selection. The effect of these among-community-level processes depends
   on the pattern of migration among communities. Migrating units may be
   individuals (migrant pool model), groups of individuals (single-species
   propagule pool model) or multi-species associations (multi-species
   propagule pool model). The most interesting case is the multi-species
   propagule pool model. Although this pattern of migration may a priori
   seem rare, it becomes more plausible in small well-defined `communities'
   such as symbiotic associations between two or a few species. Theoretical
   models and experimental studies show that community selection is
   potentially an effective evolutionary force. Such evolution can occur
   either through genetic changes within species or through changes in the
   species composition of the communities. Although laboratory studies show
   that community selection can be important, little is known about how
   important it is in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Food webs are networks of species that feed on each other. The role that
   within-population phenotypic and genetic variation plays in food web
   structure is largely unknown. Here, I show via simulation how variation
   in two key traits, growth rates and phenology, by influencing the
   variability of body sizes present through time, can potentially affect
   several structural parameters in the direction of enhancing food web
   persistence: increased connectance, decreased interaction strengths,
   increased variation among interaction strengths and increased degree of
   omnivory. I discuss other relevant traits whose variation could affect
   the structure of food webs, such as morphological and additional
   life-history traits, as well as animal personalities. Furthermore, trait
   variation could also contribute to the stability of food web modules
   through metacommunity dynamics. I propose future research to help
   establish a link between within-population variation and food web
   structure. If appropriately established, such a link could have
   important consequences for biological conservation, as it would imply
   that preserving (functional) genetic variation within populations could

Abstract = {{Social niche construction (SNC) occurs when animals actively shape their
   social environments. Currently the fitness consequences of SNC are
   poorly understood, and no study has examined whether variation in SNC
   has a genetic basis. Here we report the first instance of genetic
   variation in SNC by showing that Drosophila male aggression shapes the
   social environment. We allowed flies of different genotypes to interact
   in complex arenas; we measured the number and sex of individuals in the
   groups that formed and counted instances of mating. Arenas containing
   more aggressive male genotypes formed groups with fewer males,
   demonstrating that aggressive male genotypes experienced different
   social environments than nonaggressive genotypes. Further, genotypes
   with highest mating success were those whose SNC behavior generated the
   social environment in which they were most adept at mating: genotypes
   who mate most often after winning aggressive encounters benefit from
   aggressive SNC, while genotypes who mate most often after losing achieve
   high mating rates by forgoing aggression. The presence of these
   alternative strategies-which were robust across eight population
   densities-revealed that selection on aggression and context-dependent
   mating was disruptive, consistent with the hypothesis that SNC can
   maintain genetic variation in multiple behaviors.}},

Title = {{The past, present and future of reproductive skew theory and experiments}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{271-298}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A major evolutionary question is how reproductive sharing arises in
   cooperatively breeding species despite the inherent reproductive
   conflicts in social groups. Reproductive skew theory offers one
   potential solution: each group member gains or is allotted inclusive
   fitness equal to or exceeding their expectation from reproducing on
   their own. Unfortunately, a multitude of skew models with conflicting
   predictions has led to confusion in both testing and evaluating skew
   theory. The confusion arises partly because one set of models (the
   `transactional' type) answer the ultimate evolutionary question of what
   ranges of reproductive skew can yield fitness-enhancing solutions for
   all group members. The second set of models ('compromise') give an
   evolutionarily proximate, game-theoretic evolutionarily stable state
   (ESS) solution that determines reproductive shares based on relative
   competitive abilities. However, several predictions arising from
   compromise models require a linear payoff to increased competition and
   do not hold with non-linear payoffs. Given that for most species it may
   be very difficult or impossible to determine the true relationship
   between effort devoted to competition and reproductive share gained,
   compromise models are much less predictive than previously appreciated.
   Almost all skew models make one quantitative prediction (e.g. realized
   skew must fall within ranges predicted by transactional models), and two
   qualitative predictions (e.g. variation in relatedness or competitive
   ability across groups affects skew). A thorough review of the data finds
   that these three predictions are relatively rarely supported. As a
   general rule, therefore, the evolution of cooperative breeding appears
   not to be dependent on the ability of group members to monitor
   relatedness or competitive ability in order to adjust their behaviour
   dynamically to gain reproductive share. Although reproductive skew
   theory fails to predict within-group dynamics consistently, it does
   better at predicting quantitative differences in skew across populations
   or species. This suggests that kin selection can play a significant role
   in the evolution of sociality. To advance our understanding of
   reproductive skew will require focusing on a broader array of factors,
   such as the frequency of mistaken identity, delayed fitness payoffs, and
   selection pressures arising from across-group competition. We
   furthermore suggest a novel approach to investigate the sharing of
   reproduction that focuses on the underlying genetics of skew. A
   quantitative genetics approach allows the partitioning of variance in
   reproductive share itself or that of traits closely associated with skew
   into genetic and non-genetic sources. Thus, we can determine the
   heritability of reproductive share and infer whether it actually is the
   focus of natural selection. We view the `animal model' as the most
   promising empirical method where the genetics of reproductive share can
   be directly analyzed in wild populations. In the quest to assess whether
   skew theory can provide a framework for understanding the evolution of
   sociality, quantitative genetics will be a central tool in future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Natural selection operates both directly, via the impact of a trait upon
   the individual's own fitness, and indirectly, via the impact of the
   trait upon the fitness of the individual's genetically related social
   partners. These effects are often framed in terms of Hamilton's rule, rb
   - c > 0, which provides the central result of social-evolution theory.
   However, a number of studies have questioned the generality of
   Hamilton's rule, suggesting that it requires restrictive assumptions.
   Here, we use Fisher's genetical paradigm to demonstrate the generality
   of Hamilton's rule and to clarify links between different studies. We
   show that confusion has arisen owing to researchers misidentifying model
   parameters with the b and c terms in Hamilton's rule, and misidentifying
   measures of genotypic similarity or genealogical relationship with the
   coefficient of genetic relatedness, r. More generally, we emphasize the
   need to distinguish between general kin-selection theory that forms the
   foundations of social evolution, and streamlined kin-selection
   methodology that is used to solve specific problems.}},

Abstract = {{Cryptic evolution has been defined as adaptive evolutionary change being
   masked by concurrent environmental change. Empirical studies of cryptic
   evolution have usually invoked a changing climate and/or increasing
   population density as the form of detrimental environmental change
   experienced by a population undergoing cryptic evolution. However,
   Fisher (1958) emphasized that evolutionary change in itself is likely to
   be an important component of ``environmental deterioration,{''} a point
   restated by Cooke et al. (1990) in the context of intraspecific
   competition. In this form, environmental deterioration arises because a
   winning lineage has to compete against more winners in successive
   generations as the population evolves. This ``evolutionary environmental
   deterioration{''} has different implications for the selection and
   evolution of traits influenced by resource competition than general
   environmental change. We reformulate Cooke's model as a quantitative
   genetic model to show that it is identical in form to more recent
   developments proposed by quantitative geneticists. This provides a
   statistical framework for discriminating between the alternative
   hypotheses of environmental change and environmental deterioration
   caused by evolutionary change. We also demonstrate that in systems where
   no phenotypic change has occurred, there are many reasonable biological
   processes that will generate patterns in predicted breeding values that
   are consistent with what has been interpreted as cryptic evolution, and
   care needs to be taken when interpreting these patterns. These processes
   include mutation, sib competition, and invisible fractions.}},

Abstract = {{Mothers can modify the phenotype of their offspring both genetically and
   epigenetically, in response to the environment they experience. The role
   of maternal experience in affecting offspring clutch size is often
   difficult to measure, because parent-offspring conflict over this trait
   is common. In polyembryonic parasitoids, where each egg proliferates to
   form a clone of genetically identical siblings, the conflict is
   minimized. Therefore, they are good models for studying maternal effects
   on clutch size. In the haplodiploid parasitoid wasp Copidosoma koehleri,
   female clones contain more individuals than male clones. This may result
   from differences in genome size or in optimal body size between the
   sexes. Alternatively, maternal mating may mediate epigenetic
   physiological changes in eggs, leading to increased proliferation. We
   evaluated these hypotheses by comparing the body size and number of
   clone mates produced by mated versus virgin females. Sons of mated
   females were significantly smaller and formed larger clones than sons of
   virgins. Daughters formed the largest clones, but resembled sons of
   mated females in body size. Clone sizes of parents and offspring were
   not correlated. These findings suggest that both offspring sex and
   maternal experience (mating status) affect clone size, and that this
   trait's heritability is low. The increased proliferation by offspring of
   mated females may enhance paternal fitness by producing extra daughters,
   or benefit the offspring under conditions where the associated decrease
   in body size does not greatly reduce fitness. We estimated the
   contribution of large body size to male reproductive success through a
   mate choice assay. (C) 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{By determining access to limited resources, social dominance is often an
   important determinant of fitness. Thus, if heritable, standard theory
   predicts mean dominance should evolve. However, dominance is usually
   inferred from the tendency to win contests, and given one winner and one
   loser in any dyadic contest, the mean proportion won will always equal
   0.5. Here, we argue that the apparent conflict between quantitative
   genetic theory and common sense is resolved by recognition of indirect
   genetic effects (IGEs). We estimate selection on, and genetic
   (co)variance structures for, social dominance, in a wild population of
   red deer Cervus elaphus, on the Scottish island of Rum. While dominance
   is heritable and positively correlated with lifetime fitness, contest
   outcomes depend as much on the genes carried by an opponent as on the
   genotype of a focal individual. We show how this dependency imposes an
   absolute evolutionary constraint on the phenotypic mean, thus
   reconciling theoretical predictions with common sense. More generally,
   we argue that IGEs likely provide a widespread but poorly recognized
   source of evolutionary constraint for traits influenced by competition.}},

Abstract = {{Niche construction is an endogenous causal process in evolution,
   reciprocal to the causal process of natural selection. It works by
   adding ecological inheritance, comprising the inheritance of natural
   selection pressures previously modified by niche construction, to
   genetic inheritance in evolution. Human niche construction modifies
   selection pressures in environments in ways that affect both human
   evolution, and the evolution of other species. Human ecological
   inheritance is exceptionally potent because it includes the social
   transmission and inheritance of cultural knowledge, and material
   culture. Human genetic inheritance in combination with human cultural
   inheritance thus provides a basis for gene-culture coevolution, and
   multivariate dynamics in cultural evolution. Niche construction theory
   potentially integrates the biological and social aspects of the human
   sciences. We elaborate on these processes, and provide brief
   introductions to each of the papers published in this theme issue.}},

Abstract = {{Avian eggs are rich in carotenoids, which derive from maternal diet
   where they may be available in limiting amounts. Egg carotenoids may
   accomplish major roles in antioxidant protection or modulate
   physiological functions and growth, interfering with offspring redox
   status, potentially in a sex-dependent way. In this study of maternal
   effects in relation to sex and laying order of yellow-legged gull (Larus
   michahellis) chicks, we analyzed the consequences of increased yolk
   lutein concentration on plasma antioxidant capacity (AOC) and an index
   of early oxidative damage (reactive oxygen metabolites, ROM), till 9
   days after hatching. To this end, for the first time we directly
   manipulated yolk lutein, thus avoiding any effect on other components of
   egg quality due to maternal supplementation before laying. Lutein did
   not increase AOC but increased ROM in males and in first-laid chicks.
   Hence, lutein did not act as an antioxidant and determined increased
   early oxidative damage, possibly because of upregulation of immune or
   other physiological functions, but these effects were sex-related and
   apparent in first-laid chicks with larger yolk lutein supply. ROM
   positively covaried with AOC, suggesting a trade-off between AOC and
   oxidative damage. Moreover, lutein injection altered the covariation
   between body size or immunity and AOC or ROM. Carotenoids may thus not
   be major antioxidants in birds and rather affect redox status by
   increasing oxidative damage in a sex-dependent way and interfere with
   the resolution of growth trade-offs. In the absence of sex-related
   allocation, maternal decisions on egg carotenoid concentration may
   depend on the balance between divergent effects on either sex.}},

Abstract = {{Animal personality and behavioural syndromes have experienced rapid
   increase in interest in the last few years because of their possible
   role in the evolution of life histories. However, there is still a
   scarcity of studies concerning the mechanisms maintaining variation in
   behaviour as well as addressing their relationships to each other. In
   this paper, we tested the main assumptions of personality, focusing on
   the individual variability and repeatability of behaviour, and the
   identification of behavioural syndromes using the common vole (Microtus
   arvalis) as the species being studied. We also studied the effects of
   family group characters (group size, sex ratio and affinity to family)
   on the behaviour in this rodent. The animals were repeatedly tested in
   two behavioural experiments - novel environment (NE) test and radial-arm
   maze (RAM) test, from which seven personality traits were extracted. The
   study revealed that inter-individual variance in vole behaviour was
   consistent and repeatable. Individual-specific responses to NE
   corresponded with the performance in the maze, which revealed
   behavioural syndromes and possible trade-offs. Anxiety was determined by
   the size of the family group, whereas escape-related behaviours and
   maze-exploring tactic were more dependent on the affinity to the family.
   It seems that the development of personality traits we identified here
   is determined by the effects and structure of the family groups. Further
   studies are needed to confirm whether the observed variance in vole
   personalities is maintained by the fitness costs and benefits of the
   opposite tactics (here fast-random vs. slow-systematic exploration) in
   more natural circumstances.}},

Abstract = {{Yolk androgen deposition is a widely investigated maternal effect in
   birds, but its adaptive value is at present unclear. The offspring
   fitness correlates of natural yolk androgen levels are virtually
   unknown, whereas manipulations largely focused on testosterone and
   neglected other androgens. We determined yolk concentrations of the 2
   dominant androgens, androstenedione and testosterone, from all eggs in
   collared flycatcher clutches and followed the fate of individual
   offspring from these eggs in a crossfostering experiment. Yolk
   concentration of androstenedione was much higher than that of
   testosterone. Offspring from eggs with relatively higher androstenedione
   concentrations within a clutch were relatively large after hatching,
   grew slower thereafter, and had a higher recruitment rate in subsequent
   years. The increase of androstenedione with laying order and its
   within-clutch variance were negatively correlated with a
   condition-dependent female ornament, perhaps indicating compensatory
   hormone deposition into later hatching eggs by females in low condition.
   Yolk testosterone variation within or among clutches was not related to
   any measured aspect of offspring or parental quality. Our results
   suggest that in some species, especially those with much more
   androstenedione than testosterone in the yolk, androstenedione and not
   testosterone may be the yolk androgen with a long-term function and
   adaptive deposition pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Current interest in behavioural syndromes, or `animal personalities',
   reinforces a need for behavioural ecologists to adopt a multivariate
   view of phenotypes. Fortunately, many of the methodological and
   theoretical issues currently being dealt with by behavioural ecologists
   within the context of behavioural syndromes have previously been
   investigated by researchers in other areas of evolutionary ecology. As a
   result of these previous efforts, behavioural syndrome researchers have
   considerable theory and a wide range of tools already available to them.
   Here, we discuss aspects of quantitative genetics useful for
   understanding the multivariate phenotype as well as the relevance of
   quantitative genetics to behavioural syndrome research. These methods

Abstract = {{The evolutionary forces that drive fitness variation in species are of
   considerable interest. Despite this, the relative importance and
   interactions of genetic and social factors involved in the evolution of
   fitness traits in wild mammalian populations are largely unknown. To
   date, a few studies have demonstrated that fitness might be influenced
   by either social factors or genes in natural populations, but none have
   explored how the combined effect of social and genetic parameters might
   interact to influence fitness. Drawing from a long-term study of wild
   bottlenose dolphins in the eastern gulf of Shark Bay, Western Australia,
   we present a unique approach to understanding these interactions. Our
   study shows that female calving success depends on both genetic
   inheritance and social bonds. Moreover, we demonstrate that interactions
   between social and genetic factors also influence female fitness.
   Therefore, our study represents a major methodological advance, and
   provides critical insights into the interplay of genetic and social
   parameters of fitness.}},

   immune defence in the Speckled Wood butterfly, Pararge aegeria}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Maternal condition can generate resource-related maternal
   effects through differential egg provisioning, and can greatly affect
   offspring performance. In the present study, the speckled wood butterfly
   Pararge aegeria (L.) was used to investigate whether (after controlling
   for egg size) maternal age, and increased flight during the oviposition
   period, resulted in changes in egg provisioning and whether this
   contributed to variation in offspring performance, i) early in
   development (egg stage and early post-hatching development), and ii)
   later in larval development after being exposed to the model viral
   pathogen system; the baculovirus Autographa californica
   multinucleocapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV).
   Results: Age-related changes in maternal egg provisioning were observed
   to influence egg stage development only. Flight-induced changes in
   maternal egg provisioning had direct consequences for offspring growth
   and survival across each life stage from egg to adulthood; offspring
   from forced flight mothers had lower larval masses and longer
   development times. Offspring with lower larval masses also had reduced
   survival after exposure to the viral pathogen.
   Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that a change in maternal
   provisioning as a result of increased flight during the oviposition
   period has the potential to exert non-genetic cross-generational fitness
   effects in P. aegeria. This could have important consequences for
   population dynamics, particularly in fragmented anthropogenic
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are abundant both in natural and
   domestic populations. Such social interactions cause phenotypes of
   individuals to depend on genes carried by other individuals, a
   phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects (IGE). Because IGEs have
   drastic effects on the rate and direction of response to selection,
   knowledge of their magnitude and relationship to direct genetic effects
   (DGE) is indispensable for understanding response to selection. Very
   little is known, however, of statistical power and optimum experimental
   designs for estimating IGEs. This work, therefore, presents expressions
   for the standard errors of the estimated (co)variances of DGEs and IGEs
   and identifies optimum experimental designs for their estimation. It
   also provides an expression for optimum family size and a numerical
   investigation of optimum group size. Designs with groups composed of two
   families were optimal and substantially better than designs with groups
   composed at random with respect to family. Results suggest that IGEs can
   be detected with similar to 1000-2000 individuals and/or similar to
   250-500 groups when using optimum designs. Those values appear feasible
   for agriculture and aquaculture and for the smaller laboratory species.
   In summary, this work provides the tools to optimize and quantify the
   required size of experiments aiming to identify IGEs. An R-package SE.
   IGE is available, which predicts SEs and identifies optimum family and
   group sizes.}},

Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{P>1. There is a growing number of empirical reports of environmental
   change simultaneously influencing population dynamics, life history and
   quantitative characters. We do not have a well-developed understanding
   of links between the dynamics of these quantities.
   2. Insight into the joint dynamics of populations, quantitative
   characters and life history can be gained by deriving a model that
   allows the calculation of fundamental quantities that underpin
   population ecology, evolutionary biology and life history. The
   parameterization and analysis of such a model for a specific system can
   be used to predict how a population will respond to environmental
   change.
   3. Age-stage-structured models can be constructed from
   character-demography associations that describe age-specific
   relationships between the character and: (i) survival; (ii) fertility;
   (iii) ontogenetic development of the character among survivors; and (iv)
   the distribution of reproductive allocation.
   4. These models can be used to calculate a wide range of useful
   biological quantities including population growth and structure; terms
   in the Price equation including selection differentials; estimates of
   biometric heritabilities; and life history descriptors including
   generation time. We showcase the method through parameterization of a
   model using data from a well-studied population of Soay sheep Ovis
   aries.
   5. Perturbation analysis is used to investigate how the quantities
   listed in summary point 4 change as each parameter in each
   character-demography function is altered.
   6. A wide range of joint dynamics of life history, quantitative
   characters and population growth can be generated in response to changes
   in different character-demography associations; we argue this explains
   the diversity of observations on the consequences of environmental
   change from studies of free-living populations.
   7. The approach we describe has the potential to explain within and
   between species patterns in quantitative characters, life history and
   population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Animals vary greatly in their tendency to consume large meals. Yet,
   whether or how meal size influences fitness in wild populations is
   infrequently considered. Using a predator exclusion, mark-recapture
   experiment, we estimated selection on the amount of food accepted during
   an ad libitum feeding bout (hereafter termed `satiation threshold') in
   the wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata. Individually marked, size-matched
   females of known satiation threshold were assigned to predator exclusion
   and predator inclusion treatments and tracked for a 40-day period. We
   also estimated the narrow-sense heritability of satiation threshold
   using dam-on-female-offspring regression. In the absence of predation,
   high satiation threshold was positively associated with larger and
   faster egg case production. However, these selective advantages were
   lost when predators were present. We estimated the heritability of
   satiation threshold to be 0.56. Taken together, our results suggest that
   satiation threshold can respond to selection and begets a life history
   trade-off in this system: high satiation threshold individuals tend to
   produce larger egg cases but also suffer increased susceptibility to
   predation.}},

Abstract = {{Records from a colony of captive Indian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta)
   were used to estimate heritability for a number of reproductive traits.
   Records were based on a total of 7,816 births by 1,901 females from 1979
   to 2007 Heritability was estimated with a linear animal model using a
   multiple trait derivative free REML set of programs. Because no male
   parents were identified, the numerator relationship matrix contained
   female kinships established over six generations. Reproductive traits
   included female age at the birth of the first, second and last infant,
   age at death, inter-birth intervals, number of infants born per female
   and infant survival. Heritability for each trait was estimated as the
   ratio of the additive genetic variance to phenotypic variance adjusted
   for significant fixed effects. Estimates of heritability for early
   reproduction ranged from 0.000 +/- 0.072 for birth interval after the
   first reproduction to 0.171 +/- 0.062 for age of female at the first
   infant. Higher estimates of heritability were found for female longevity
   {[}0.325 +/- 0.143] and for productivity of deceased females born before
   1991 {[}0.221 +/- 0.138]. Heritability for infant survival ranged from
   0.061 +/- 0.018 for survival from 30 days to 1 year to 0 290 +/- 0.050
   for survival from birth to 30 days when adjusted to an underlying normal
   distribution Eight of the 13 estimates of heritability for reproductive
   traits in this study were different from zero {[}P < 0.05]. Generally,
   heritability estimates reported in this study for reproductive traits of
   captive rhesus macaque females are similar to those reported in the
   literature for free-ranging rhesus macaque females and for similar
   reproductive traits of other species. These estimates of heritability
   for reproductive traits appear to be among the first for a relatively
   large colony of captive rhesus macaque females. Am. J. Primatol.

Abstract = {{Interactions among conspecifics influence social evolution through two
   distinct but intimately related paths. First, they provide the
   opportunity for indirect genetic effects (IGEs), where genes expressed
   in one individual influence the expression of traits in others. Second,
   interactions can generate social selection when traits expressed in one
   individual influence the fitness of others. Here, we present a
   quantitative genetic model of multivariate trait evolution that
   integrates the effects of both IGEs and social selection, which have
   previously been modeled independently. We show that social selection
   affects evolutionary change whenever the breeding value of one
   individual covaries with the phenotype of its social partners. This
   covariance can be created by both relatedness and IGEs, which are shown
   to have parallel roles in determining evolutionary response. We show
   that social selection is central to the estimation of inclusive fitness
   and derive a version of Hamilton's rule showing the symmetrical effects
   of relatedness and IGEs on the evolution of altruism. We illustrate the
   utility of our approach using altruism, greenbeards, aggression, and
   weapons as examples. Our model provides a general predictive equation
   for the evolution of social phenotypes that encompasses specific cases
   such as kin selection and reciprocity. The parameters can be measured
   empirically, and we emphasize the importance of considering both IGEs
   and social selection, in addition to relatedness, when testing
   hypotheses about social evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive foraging tactics are shaped by genes, the environment and
   gene-environment interactions. Because of relatively high levels of
   agonism toward conspecifics, spiders have been a popular focus for
   behavioral-ecological examinations of conspecific predation, or
   cannibalism. Surprisingly, studies examining the underlying, proximate
   assumption that cannibalism in spiders is a heritable trait shaped by
   interactions between genes and the environment are virtually
   non-existent. Here, we examine the influence of family on the expression
   of sibling cannibalism in the post-hatching, group-living phase of an
   otherwise solitary, web-building spider, the North American black widow
   (Latrodectus hesperus). Our results showed significant levels of
   variation in cannibalistic propensity among 26 sibships, with some
   families cannibalizing full sibs within 2 d and other families waiting 3
   wk before resorting to cannibalism. A similar family-level effect was
   evident in measures of sibling cohabitation, voracity toward cricket
   prey, and development speed. Negative correlations between maternal egg
   sac investment and offspring cannibalism suggest that this family effect
   may stem, at least in part, from a maternal effect, although we were not
   able to directly test the prediction that cannibalism is most common
   from spiderlings in poor condition. Thus, we present novel data
   suggesting family effects seem to be responsible for cannibalism in L.
   hesperus spiderlings; however, future work will be required to
   disentangle the relative importance of shared genes and shared maternal
   environment. We discuss several mechanisms that could explain the
   persistence of family-level variation in cannibalism, a trait that seems
   likely to be subject to strong directional selection.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{When individuals interact, phenotypic variation can be partitioned into
   direct genetic effects (DGEs) of the individuals' own genotypes,
   indirect genetic effects (IGEs) of their social partners' genotypes and
   epistatic interactions between the genotypes of interacting individuals
   ('genotype-by-genotype (GxG) epistasis'). These components can all play
   important roles in evolutionary processes, but few empirical studies
   have examined their importance. The social amoeba Dictyostelium
   discoideum provides an ideal system to measure these effects during
   social interactions and development. When starved, free-living amoebae
   aggregate and differentiate into a multicellular fruiting body with a
   dead stalk that holds aloft viable spores. By measuring interactions
   among a set of natural strains, we quantify DGEs, IGEs and GxG epistasis
   affecting spore formation. We find that DGEs explain most of the
   phenotypic variance (57.6\%) whereas IGEs explain a smaller (13.3\%) but
   highly significant component. Interestingly, GxG epistasis explains
   nearly a quarter of the variance (23.0\%), highlighting the complex
   nature of genotype interactions. These results demonstrate the large
   impact that social interactions can have on development and suggest that
   social effects should play an important role in developmental evolution
   in this system.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetics effects (IGEs)-when the genotype of one individual
   affects the phenotypic expression of a trait in another-may alter
   evolutionary trajectories beyond that predicted by standard quantitative
   genetic theory as a consequence of genotypic evolution of the social
   environment. For IGEs to occur, the trait of interest must respond to
   one or more indicator traits in interacting conspecifics. In
   quantitative genetic models of IGEs, these responses (reaction norms)
   are termed interaction effect coefficients and are represented by the
   parameter psi (Psi). The extent to which Psi exhibits genetic variation
   within a population, and may therefore itself evolve, is unknown. Using
   an experimental evolution approach, we provide evidence for a genetic
   basis to the phenotypic response caused by IGEs on sexual display traits
   in Drosophila serrata. We show that evolution of the response is
   affected by sexual but not natural selection when flies adapt to a novel
   environment. Our results indicate a further mechanism by which IGEs can
   alter evolutionary trajectories-the evolution of interaction effects
   themselves.}},

Abstract = {{Avian eggs contain variable levels of several maternal androgens that
   may all be important in adjusting offspring phenotype at the individual
   or brood level. Most studies have focused on experimental manipulations
   of testosterone (T), and the other yolk androgens such as
   androstenedione (A(4)) and 5-alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) were so far
   neglected. However, in species where the amount of A(4) in the yolk much
   exceeds that of the other androgens, A(4) could represent the dominant
   agent of androgen-mediated maternal effects, in which case manipulations
   of T would be misdirected. We conducted our study in a species with high
   yolk A(4) and relatively low T and DHT levels, the Japanese quail
   Coturnix japonica. We injected unincubated eggs with a physiological
   dose of either A(4), T, or DHT, and measured hatchling growth, as well
   as behaviour in an open field test. T treatment non-significantly
   increased social reinstatement behaviour in the open field test, but it
   seemed to significantly suppress early skeletal growth and mass gain.
   The A(4) and DHT treatments, in contrast, significantly increased
   reinstatement behaviour, but did not affect mass and size growth. These
   results suggest that future investigations should view yolk androgens as
   integrated components of the complex yolk steroid environment.}},

Title = {{Indirect genetic effects in a sex-limited trait: the case of breeding

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Female reproductive performance can be strongly affected by male care,
   so that breeding time, a trait expressed only by females, can be seen as
   one trait determined by both male and female genotypes. Animal model
   analyses of a 46-year study of red-billed gulls (Larus novaehollandiae
   scopulinus) revealed that laying date was not heritable in females (h2 =
   0.001 +/- 0.030), but significantly so in males (h2 = 0.134 +/- 0.029).
   Heritability of breeding time in males probably reflects genetic
   variability in some other trait such as courtship feeding ability. In
   line with predictions of evolutionary models incorporating indirect
   genetic effects, the strong and consistent directional selection for
   advanced breeding time has not resulted in detectable selection response
   in males. Our results demonstrate that a female trait is largely
   determined by genetic characteristics of its mate, and hence, any
   evolutionary change in red-billed gull breeding time depends critically
   on genetic variation in males.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Recent research has pointed to the ubiquity and abundance of
   between-generation epigenetic inheritance. This research has
   implications for assessing disease risk and the responses to ecological
   stresses and also for understanding evolutionary dynamics. An important
   step toward a general evaluation of these implications is the
   identification and estimation of the amount of heritable, epigenetic
   variation in populations. While methods for modeling the phenotypic
   heritable variance contributed by culture have already been developed,
   there are no comparable methods for nonbehavioral epigenetic inheritance
   systems. By introducing a model that takes epigenetic transmissibility
   (the probability of transmission of ancestral phenotypes) and
   environmental induction into account, we provide novel expressions for
   covariances between relatives. We have combined a classical quantitative
   genetics approach with information about the number of opportunities for
   epigenetic reset between generations and assumptions about environmental
   induction to estimate the heritable epigenetic variance and epigenetic
   transmissibility for both asexual and sexual populations. This assists
   us in the identification of phenotypes and populations in which
   epigenetic transmission occurs and enables a preliminary quantification
   of their transmissibility, which could then be followed by genomewide
   association and QTL studies.}},

Abstract = {{In studies of population ecology, demography and life history evolution,
   among-individual differences in traits associated with survival and
   reproduction are often attributed to variation in `individual quality'.
   However, often intuitive quality is rarely defined explicitly, and we
   argue that this can result in ambiguity about what quality actually is.
   Here we consider the various ways in which the concept of quality is
   currently applied, and show that subtle differences in intended meaning
   have very important consequences when the goal is to draw evolutionary
   inferences. We also propose a novel approach that is consistent with all
   current ecological uses, but also allows the concept of quality to be
   integrated with existing evolutionary theory.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{179-192}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{High-impact biological invasions often involve establishment and spread
   in disturbed, high-resource patches followed by establishment and spread
   in biotically or abiotically stressful areas. Evolutionary change may be
   required for the second phase of invasion (establishment and spread in
   stressful areas) to occur. When species have low genetic diversity and
   short selection history, within-generation phenotypic plasticity is
   often cited as the mechanism through which spread across multiple
   habitat types can occur. We show that trans-generational plasticity
   (TGP) can result in pre-adapted progeny that exhibit traits associated
   with increased fitness both in high-resource patches and in stressful
   conditions. In the invasive sedge, Cyperus esculentus, maternal plants
   growing in nutrient-poor patches can place disproportional number of
   propagules into nutrient-rich patches. Using the invasive annual grass,
   Aegilops triuncialis, we show that maternal response to soil conditions
   can confer greater stress tolerance in seedlings in the form of greater
   photosynthetic efficiency. We also show TGP for a phenological shift in
   a low resource environment that results in greater stress tolerance in
   progeny. These lines of evidence suggest that the maternal environment
   can have profound effects on offspring success and that TGP may play a
   significant role in some plant invasions.}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{491-508}},

Abstract = {{Parental effects comprise a wide range of mechanisms that individuals
   may adopt to enhance viability and adjust the phenotype of their
   offspring according to the conditions that the offspring will experience
   after birth. For example, individual choice of breeding habitat may
   mediate such parental effects via an effect of prenatal breeding
   conditions independently or in combination with offspring post-natal
   environment. However, ecological factors relevant to adaptive breeding
   habitat choice may vary at different spatial scales, which have been
   rarely investigated simultaneously. In the first part of the present
   study we use hierarchical linear models to disentangle micro- and
   macro-environmental variation in abundance and breeding performance of a
   small passerine bird, the barn swallow Hirundo rustica. We show that
   environmental conditions at the scale of nesting microhabitat are more
   influential than macro-environmental conditions at the scale of foraging
   range. We then experimentally investigate the effect of variation in
   micro-environmental conditions on growth and immunity of chicks by
   partially cross-fostering nestlings immediately after hatching between
   different nesting micro-habitats. Our results disclosed significant
   effects of environmental conditions where eggs were laid and incubated
   but not of those where nestlings grew-up on some components of nestling
   phenotype important for fitness. These results suggest that adults may
   enhance offspring quality by adjusting prenatal parental effects
   mediated by e.g., egg quality according to micro-habitat conditions
   where parents are breeding.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Parasitized females in mammals, fish and birds can enhance the
   immune defence of their offspring by transferring specific antibodies
   for the embryo. Likewise, social insect mothers transfer immunity
   despite the fact that invertebrates lack antibodies.
   2. Female trans-generational immune priming is consistent with parental
   investment theory, because mothers invest more into rearing their
   offspring than fathers. However, when immune priming is not directly
   linked to parental care, as is often the case in insects that abandon
   their eggs after oviposition, both sexes might benefit from protecting
   their offspring.
   3. Using the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, we show that after
   parental exposure to heat-killed bacteria, trans-generational immune
   priming occurs through fathers as well as mothers.
   4. This novel finding challenges the traditional view that males provide
   only genes to their offspring in species without paternal care, and
   raises the possibility of a division of tasks with respect to immune
   protection between parents.}},

   study sought to determine if genetic effects underlying phenotypic
   differences varied between the worker and queen castes of the social
   wasp Vespula maculifrons. We predicted that directional selection would
   remove genetic variation associated with size differences in the queen
   caste, whereas a lack of directional selection would tend to maintain
   genetic variation associated with size differences in the worker caste.
   We thus (1) calculated broad and narrow sense heritabilities for several
   morphological traits, (2) examined whether some paternal genotypes
   produced more morphologically diverse offspring than others, and (3)
   determined whether trait size variation was associated with genetic
   variation within colonies. We found that few morphological traits were
   significantly heritable, indicating that little genetic variance for
   those traits existed within our study population. We also found that
   some patrilines produced more morphologically variable offspring than
   others, suggesting a role of genotype in phenotypic plasticity. And
   finally, no significant correlations between genetic diversity arising
   from multiple mating by queens within colonies and trait variation in
   either caste were found. Overall, our findings indicate a weak effect of
   genotype on both worker and queen body size variation and are suggestive
   of a large environmental influence on morphological trait size.
   Moreover, our results do not indicate that levels of genetic variation
   underlying size variation differ substantially between castes in this
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Reproduction, and thus information transfer across generations, is the
   most essential process of life, yet biologists lack a consensus on terms
   to define biological information. Unfortunately, multiple definitions of
   the same terms and other disagreements have long inhibited the
   development of a general frarmwork for integrating the various
   categories of biological information. Currently, the only consensus is
   over two general categories, genetic information, which is encoded in
   DNA, and non-genetic information, which is extracted from the
   environment. Non-genetic information is the key to understanding
   gene-environment interactions and is the raw material of Fields such as
   developmental plasticity, behavoir, communication, social learning and
   Cultural evolution. In effect, differences in information possessed by
   individuals produce phenotypic variation. We thus define biological
   information as `factors that can affect the phenotype in ways that may
   influence Fitness'. This definition encompasses all information that is
   potentially relevant to organisms, which includes the physical
   environment. Biological information can be acquired passively from genes
   or via processes Such as epigenetics, parental effects and habitat
   inheritance, or actively by organisms sensing facts about their
   environment. The confusion over definitions mainly concerns non-genetic
   information, which takes many more forms than genetic information. Much
   of the confusion derives from definitions based on how information is
   used rather than on the facts from which it is extracted. We recognize
   that a fact becomes information once it is detected. Information can
   thus be viewed analogously to energy in being either potential or
   realized. Another Source of confusion is in the use of words outside
   their usual meanings. We therefore present intuitive definitions and
   classify them according to categories of facts in a hierarchical
   framework. Clarifying these concepts and terms may help researchers to
   manipulate facts, allowing a fuller study of biological information.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic variance results from variation in biological information
   possessed by individuals. Quantitative geneticists often strive to
   partition Out all environmental variance to measure heritability.
   Behavioral biologists and ecologists however, require methods to
   integrate genetic and environmental components of inherited phenotypic
   variance in order to estimate the evolutionary potential of traits,
   which encompasses any form of information that is inherited. To help
   develop this integration, we build on the tools of quantitative genetics
   and offer the concept of `inclusive heritability' which identifies and
   unifies the various mechanisms of information transmission across
   generations. A controversial component of non-genetic information is
   animal Culture, which is the part of phenotypic variance inherited
   through social learning. Culture has the unique property of being
   transmitted horizontally and obliquely, as well as vertically.
   Accounting for cultural variation Would allow us to examine a broader
   range of evolutionary mechanisms. Culture may, for instance, produce
   behavioral isolating mechanisms leading to speciation. To advance the
   study of animal culture, we offer a definition of culture that is rooted
   in quantitative genetics. We also offer four testable criteria to
   determine whether a trait is culturally inherited. These criteria may
   constitute a conceptual tool to study animal culture. We briefly discuss
   methods to partition out cultural variance. Several authors have
   recently called for `modernizing the modern synthesis' by including
   non-genetic factors such as epigenetics and phenotypic plasticity in
   order to more fully explain phenotypic evolution. Here, we further
   propose to broaden the concept of inheritance by incorporating the
   cultural component of behavior. Applying the concept of inclusive
   heritability may advance the integracion of multiple forms of
   inheritance into the study of evolution.}},

Title = {{Antagonistic Parent-Offspring Co-Adaptation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: In species across taxa, offspring have means to influence
   parental investment (PI). PI thus evolves as an interacting phenotype
   and indirect genetic effects may strongly affect the co-evolutionary
   dynamics of offspring and parental behaviors. Evolutionary theory
   focused on explaining how exaggerated offspring solicitation can be
   understood as resolution of parent-offspring conflict, but the
   evolutionary origin and diversification of different forms of family
   interactions remains unclear.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In contrast to previous theory that
   largely uses a static approach to predict how ``offspring individuals''
   and ``parental individuals'' should interact given conflict over PI, we
   present a dynamic theoretical framework of antagonistic selection on the
   PI individuals obtain/take as offspring and the PI they provide as
   parents to maximize individual lifetime reproductive success; we analyze
   a deterministic and a stochastic version of this dynamic framework. We
   show that a zone for equivalent co-adaptation outcomes exists in which
   stable levels of PI can evolve and be maintained despite fast strategy
   transitions and ongoing co-evolutionary dynamics. Under antagonistic
   co-adaptation, cost-free solicitation can evolve as an adaptation to
   emerging preferences in parents.
   Conclusions/Significance: We show that antagonistic selection across the
   offspring and parental life-stage of individuals favors co-adapted
   offspring and parental behavior within a zone of equivalent outcomes.
   This antagonistic parent-offspring co-adaptation does not require
   solicitation to be costly, allows for rapid divergence and evolutionary
   novelty and potentially explains the origin and diversification of the
   observed provisioning forms in family life.}},

Abstract = {{Contrary to many separate sex systems, the evolutionary ecology of
   polyandry in simultaneous hermaphrodites, and in particular in those
   with internal fertilization, has received little attention. Recent
   studies on the promiscuous gastropod Chelidonura sandrana showed that
   offspring size, an important determinant of offspring performance in
   many marine invertebrates, varies with the number of different mating
   partners. However, the source of this differential allocation by mothers
   remained unclear. Using a quantitative genetic model, we here tested for
   parental effects on offspring size and the importance of `good gene'
   effects on early life history traits. Our analysis revealed no
   significant sire but strong dam effects for all investigated traits.
   Moreover, embryo viability tended to increase with egg capsule volume,
   thus linking offspring size with offspring performance. Our findings
   suggest that in C. sandrana (1) differential allocation is a maternal
   effect in response to the number of different partners, and that (2)
   additive genetic variance is of negligible importance in early life
   history traits.}},

Title = {{Maternal-Zygotic Epistasis and the Evolution of Genetic Diseases}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICINE AND BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Abstract = {{Many birth defects and genetic diseases are expressed in individuals
   that do not carry the disease causing alleles. Genetic diseases observed
   in offspring can be caused by gene expression in mothers and by
   interactions between gene expression in mothers and offspring. It is not
   clear whether the underlying pattern of gene expression (maternal versus
   offspring) affects the incidence of genetic disease. Here we develop a
   2-locus population genetic model with epistatic interactions between a
   maternal gene and a zygotic gene to address this question. We show that
   maternal effect genes that affect disease susceptibility in offspring
   persist longer and at higher frequencies in a population than offspring
   genes with the same effects. We find that specific forms of
   maternalzygotic epistasis can maintain disease causing alleles at high
   frequencies over a range of plausible values. Our findings suggest that
   the strength and form of epistasis and the underlying pattern of gene
   expression may greatly influence the prevalence of human genetic
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Competition and cooperation is fundamental to evolution by natural

   consequences of such interactions for response in fitness due to natural
   selection. I provide quantitative genetic expressions for heritable
   variance and response in fitness due to natural selection when
   conspecifics interact. Results show that interactions among conspecifics
   generate extra heritable variance in fitness, and that interacting with
   kin is the key to evolutionary success because it translates the extra
   heritable variance into response in fitness. This work also unifies
   Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection (FTNS) and Hamilton's
   inclusive fitness (IF). The FTNS implies that natural selection
   maximizes fitness, whereas Hamilton proposed maximization of IF. This
   work shows that the FTNS describes the increase in IF, rather than
   direct fitness, at a rate equal to the additive genetic variance in
   fitness. Thus, Hamilton's IF and Fisher's FTNS both describe the

Abstract = {{Epigenetics, the transgenerational transfer of phenotypic characters
   without modification of gene sequence, is a burgeoning area of study in
   many disciplines of biology. However, the potential impact of this
   phenomenon on the physiology of animals is not yet broadly appreciated,
   in part because the phenomenon of epigenetics is not typically part of
   the design of physiological investigations. Still enigmatic and somewhat
   ill defined is the relationship between the overarching concept of
   epigenetics and interesting transgenerational phenomena (e.g.
   `maternal/parental effects') that alter the physiological phenotype of
   subsequent generations. The lingering effect on subsequent generations
   of an initial environmental disturbance in parent animals can be
   profound, with genes continuing to be variously silenced or expressed
   without an associated change in gene sequence for many generations.
   Known epigenetic mechanisms involved in this phenomenon include
   chromatin remodeling (DNA methylation and histone modification),
   RNA-mediated modifications (non-coding RNA and microRNA), as well as
   other less well studied mechanisms such as self-sustaining loops and
   structural inheritance. In this review we: (1) discuss how the concepts
   of epigenetics and maternal effects both overlap with, and are distinct
   from, each other; (2) analyze examples of existing animal physiological
   studies based on these concepts; and (3) offer a construct by which to
   integrate these concepts into the design of future investigations in
   animal physiology.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic parameters for weaning weight were estimated in a Zebu beef
   cattle population in Camaguey province, Cuba. Data for 20,151 calves
   born between 1988 and 2006 were used in six variants of the statistical
   animal model. Contemporary groups (year-herd-season-sex) were used as a
   common fixed effect, and a weaning age linear regression and dam age
   linear and quadratic regressions as covariables. Animal random effect
   was common to all models, and models 2 to 6 had different combinations
   of genetic maternal effects, maternal permanent environmental effect and
   covariance between direct and maternal genetic effects. A log likelihood
   test showed the best model to be that which included animal random
   effects, maternal effects, covariance between direct and maternal
   effects and permanent environment. Heritability for direct (0.06 to
   0.34) and maternal genetic effects (0.06 to 0.19) varied between models.
   Correlation between direct and maternal genetic effects varied from
   -0.12 +/- 0.13 to -0.19 +/- 0.15. The maternal permanent environmental
   effect explained 13 \% of total variability. Heritability of weaning
   weight in the studied population can be overestimated when the animal
   model does not include maternal effects. The direct and maternal effects
   heritability values were low, but the relative absence of genetic
   antagonism between these effects indicates the possibility of moderate
   genetic improvement by selection.}},

Abstract = {{Social environments are inherently dynamic, often changing depending on
   the frequency and outcomes of conspecific interactions - they can be
   simultaneously the targets and agents of selection. Understanding how
   organisms settle in heterogeneous social environments and the effects
   this has on reproductive success is vital to our understanding of the
   selective forces at work in wild populations. From an intensive
   behavioural and ecological study of territoriality in the polymorphic
   white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), we demonstrate that
   males of the two morphs inhabit social niches that correspond to their
   respective alternative reproductive strategies. By integrating molecular
   ecology and Geographic Information Systems, we generated continuous,
   socio-spatial models of local conspecific density and cuckoldry risk.
   Our results suggest that the morphs segregate their territories based on
   socio-spatial variables, creating a heterogeneous social landscape that
   matches each behavioural phenotype with a favourable social environment.
   Specifically, the monogamous tan males tended to settle in low-density
   areas that were also low for cuckoldry risk, while the opposite was true
   for the promiscuous white males. This pattern of socio-spatial
   heterogeneity, combined with the social niche partitioning we observed,
   might act as a social niche polymorphism, and play an important role in
   maintenance of the alternative reproductive strategies of the
   white-throated sparrow. Socio-spatial factors, similar to those observed
   in the white-throated sparrow, may play important roles in the evolution
   of mating systems in other species, even those with more continuous or
   cryptic variation.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects are environmental components of phenotypes that
   complicate relationships between natural selection and evolution because
   they often affect phenotypes and fitness simultaneously. We studied the
   effects of egg size variation on juvenile survival in a population of
   American coots (Fulica americana). We experimentally evaluated egg size
   variation at three levels: across the population, within natal nests,
   and within foster nests. Natal nests accounted for the most variation in
   population egg size. Within clutches, early-laid eggs were larger than
   later-laid eggs, with the exception of first-laid eggs, which were
   small. In the fostering experiment, posthatching survival was most
   strongly related to egg size relative to natal siblings and natal
   hatching order and less so to egg size within foster nests. These
   effects on survival were found even though young from natal nests were
   neither raised together nor raised by genetic parents. These results
   indicate that females allocate resources unequally among offspring such
   that offspring from larger, early-laid eggs have higher survival than
   offspring from smaller, later-laid eggs, regardless of their size
   relative to foster siblings or to mean population egg size. These
   results suggest that egg size variation can be maintained through
   selection on maternal investment strategies and not on egg size per se.}},

Pages = {{696-708}},

Abstract = {{Bright yellow to red signals used in mate choice or intrasexual
   competition are based on carotenoid pigments that are hypothesized to be
   traded between physiological functions and coloration. These signals
   have recently been shown to be influenced by maternal effects. Indeed,
   yolk-derived carotenoids are essential for embryos to develop efficient
   carotenoid metabolism in posthatching life. Maternal effects facilitate
   adaptation to environmental variability and influence the evolution of
   phenotypic traits such as secondary sexual signals. Here we propose that
   maternal investment in yolk carotenoids promotes the evolution of
   carotenoid-based ornaments. We conducted a comparative analysis of
   lipid-soluble antioxidants (carotenoids and vitamins A and E) in the
   eggs of 112 species of bird. Species with large clutch sizes deposited
   higher yolk concentrations of the three antioxidants. There was a
   significant positive relationship between yolk carotenoids and the
   expression of male carotenoid-based signals, but not between yolk
   carotenoids and sexual dichromatism in these signals. These
   relationships were specific to carotenoids, as they were not found for
   vitamins A and E. This provides evidence consistent with the hypothesis
   that maternal effects mediated by yolk carotenoids play a role in the
   evolution of carotenoid-based signals as a response to sexual selection,
   likely based on organizational effects of carotenoids during embryo
   development.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of matrotrophy introduces the potential for genomic
   conflicts between mothers and embryos. These conflicts are hypothesized
   to accelerate the evolution of reproductive isolation and to influence
   the evolution of life-history traits, reproductive structures, and
   genomic imprinting. These hypotheses assume offspring can influence the
   amount of maternal investment they receive and that there is a trade-off
   between maternal investment into individual offspring and maternal
   survival or fecundity. We used field data and laboratory crosses to test
   whether these assumptions are met in the matrotrophic poeciliid fish
   Heterandria formosa. Comparisons of life histories between two natural
   populations demonstrated a trade-off between the level of maternal
   investment into individual embryos and maternal fecundity. Laboratory
   crosses between individuals from these populations revealed that
   offspring genotype exerts an influence on the level of maternal
   investment and affects maternal fecundity through higher rates of embryo
   abortion and lower numbers of full-term offspring. Our results show that
   the prerequisites for parent offspring conflict to be a potent
   evolutionary force in poeciliid fish are present in H. formosa. However,
   determining whether this conflict has shaped maternal investment in
   nature will require disentangling any effects of conflict from those of
   several ecological factors that are themselves correlated with the
   expected intensity of conflict.}},

Abstract = {{Differential reproductive investment by the mother can critically
   influence offspring development and phenotype, and strong selection is
   therefore expected to act on such maternal effects. Although a genetic
   basis is a prerequisite for phenotypic traits to respond to selection
   and thus to evolve, we still know very little about the extent of
   heritable variation in maternal effects in natural populations. Here, we
   present the first estimates of intrafemale repeatability across breeding
   seasons and estimates of heritability of hormone-mediated maternal
   effects in a wild population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula
   albicollis). We found that maternal yolk testosterone (T)
   concentrations, yolk mass, and egg mass were moderately to highly
   repeatable within females across years, whereas intrafemale consistency
   of maternal yolk androstenedione (A4) deposition was low yet
   statistically significant. Furthermore, maternal yolk T transfer, yolk
   mass, and egg mass were significantly heritable, whereas yolk A4
   transfer was not. These results strongly suggest that two major maternal
   yolk androgens are differentially regulated by genes and the
   environment. Selection on heritable variation in maternal yolk T
   deposition has the potential to shape the rate and direction of
   phenotypic change in offspring traits and can thereby accelerate or
   impede the response to selection in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{An artificial life approach is taken to explore the effect that lifetime
   learning can have on the evolution of certain life history traits, in
   particular the periods of protection that parents offer their young, and
   the age at first reproduction of those young. The study begins by
   simulating the evolution of simple artificial neural network systems
   that must learn quickly to perform well on simple classification tasks,
   and determining if and when extended periods of parental protection
   emerge. It is concluded that longer periods of parental protection of
   children do offer clear learning advantages and better adult
   performance, but only if procreation is not allowed during the
   protection period. In this case, a compromise protection period evolves
   that balances the improved learning performance against reduced
   procreation period. The crucial properties of the neural learning
   processes are then abstracted out to explore the possibility of studying
   the effect of learning more generally and with better computational
   efficiency. Throughout, the implications of these simulations for more
   realistic scenarios are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In mammals, the most significant maternal effect on offspring growth
   during lactation is the ability of females to efficiently transfer milk
   energy to their neonates. However, despite the importance of the
   transfer of milk energy to both maternal and offspring fitness, nothing
   is known about the extent to which variation among females may be
   attributed to differences in individual quality or environmental
   variation in natural populations. We measured repeatability over
   multiple lactation periods in components of lactation performance in
   free-ranging, multiparous gray seal (Halichoerus grypus) females to
   examine to what extent variation among females in pup weaning mass may
   be attributed to inherent differences in their physiological capacity to
   deliver milk energy. Levels of repeatability were high for milk
   composition (r = 0.38-0.50), daily milk output (r = 0.46), and the
   duration of lactation (r = 0.57), demonstrating that there are
   consistent differences among females in these characters across
   lactations and that the overall capacity of gray seal females to deliver
   milk energy to their pups is characteristic of individuals. The
   repeatability in pup weaning mass (r = 0.48) was consistent with the
   values for the components of total milk energy output and suggests that,
   over a large proportion of their reproductive life, individual gray seal
   females will consistently wean pups with greater or lesser probabilities
   of survival. Our results suggest that inherent differences among females
   in their physiological capacity to deliver milk energy may be an
   important component of variation in individual quality and, thus,
   lifetime reproductive success in mammals. High levels of repeatability
   also suggest that components of milk energy transfer may have a
   significant heritable genetic basis.}},

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge of the quantitative genetics of resistance to parasitism is
   key to appraise host evolutionary responses to parasite selection. Here,
   we studied effects of common origin (i.e. genetic and pre-hatching
   parental effects) and common rearing environment (i.e. post-hatching
   parental effects and other environment effects) on variance in
   ectoparasite load in nestling Alpine swifts (Apus melba). This colonial
   bird is intensely parasitized by blood sucking louse-flies that impair
   nestling development and survival. By cross-fostering half of the
   hatchlings between pairs of nests, we show strong significant effect of
   common rearing environment on variance (90.7\% in 2002 and 90.9\% in
   2003) in the number of louse-flies per nestling and no significant
   effect of common origin on variance in the number of louse-flies per
   nestling. In contrast, significant effects of common origin were found
   for all the nestling morphological traits (i.e. body mass, wing length,
   tail length, fork length and sternum length) under investigation. Hence,
   our study suggests that genetic and pre-hatching parental effects play
   little role in the distribution of parasites among nestling Alpine
   swifts, and thus that nestlings have only limited scope for evolutionary
   responses against parasites. Our results highlight the need to take into
   consideration environmental factors, including the evolution of
   post-hatching parental effects such as nest sanitation, in our
   understanding of host-parasite relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Plant litter is an important determinant of seed germination and
   seedling establishment. Positive effects of litter have received
   considerable attention, but few studies have explicitly tested whether
   seedlings are more facilitated by conspecific litter compared to
   heterospecific litter. In order to contrast conspecific and
   heterospecific facilitative effects on seedling establishment, we used
   Anthriscus sylvestris, Angelica sylvestris, Pimpinella saxifraga and
   different combinations of their seeds and litter seedbeds as a model
   system. Although litter had a significant species-specific effect on
   seedling emergence, we found no evidence of strictly conspecific
   facilitation. Anthriscus sylvestris displayed a positive response to all
   types of litter. In contrast, there was a clear negative effect of
   conspecific litter in Pimpinella saxifraga. Activated carbon did not
   modify the negative effect, indicating that chemical compounds were not
   the cause. Our study suggests a high level of idiosyncrasy in response
   to litter at the species level.}},

Abstract = {{The solicitation behaviours performed by dependent young are under
   selection from the environment created by their parents, as well as
   wider ecological conditions. Here we show how mechanisms acting before
   hatching enable canary offspring to adapt their begging behaviour to a
   variable post-hatching world. Cross-fostering experiments revealed that
   canary nestling begging intensity is positively correlated with the
   provisioning level of their own parents (to foster chicks). When we
   experimentally increased food quality before and during egg laying,
   mothers showed higher faecal androgen levels and so did their nestlings,
   even when they were cross-fostered before hatching to be reared by
   foster mothers that had been exposed to a standard regime of food
   quality. Higher parental androgen levels were correlated with greater
   levels of post-hatching parental provisioning and (we have previously
   shown) increased faecal androgens in chicks were associated with greater
   begging intensity. We conclude that androgens mediate environmentally
   induced plasticity in the expression of both parental and offspring
   traits, which remain correlated as a result of prenatal effects,
   probably acting within the egg. Offspring can thus adapt their begging
   intensity to variable family and ecological environments.}},

Abstract = {{Timing of flowering is central to reproductive success and is currently
   advancing in many natural populations due to a warmer climate. However,
   we have little understanding of how earlier initiation of flowering
   influences subsequent reproductive phenology or the expression of traits
   in the offspring. To evaluate the consequences of an altered flowering
   phenology we manipulated cohorts of Campanulastrum americanum, an herb
   with annual and biennial growth forms, to flower and disperse seeds up
   to a month earlier, at the same time, and up to a month later than a
   natural population in two separate years. Relative to the date of first
   flower, the temporal patterns of flower production and the timing of
   fruit maturation and seed dispersal were similar among individuals that
   initiated flowering over the expanded reproductive season, indicating
   strong phenological integration of reproductive traits. However, plants
   that initiated flowering substantially outside the natural window showed
   a change in the rate of reproduction, with a compressed reproductive
   schedule for early-flowering individuals and an expanded one for
   late-flowering plants. Changes in flowering time had more dramatic
   effects on the offspring generation. Initiation of flowering two weeks
   earlier would result in a fourfold increase in the frequency of annual
   offspring, and four weeks earlier would result in a tenfold increase.
   The frequency of annuals was less sensitive to modest delays in
   flowering time but decreased with greater delays in flowering time.
   Collectively, these results reveal a tightly integrated reproductive
   phenology that shifts with timing of flowering within generations but
   may lead to more dramatic responses to climate change between
   generations.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of its success, Neo-Darwinism is faced with major conceptual
   barriers to further progress, deriving directly from its metaphysical
   foundations. Most importantly, neo-Darwinism fails to recognize a
   fundamental cause of evolutionary change, ``niche construction{''}. This
   failure restricts the generality of evolutionary theory, and introduces
   inaccuracies. It also hinders the integration of evolutionary biology
   with neighbouring disciplines, including ecosystem ecology,
   developmental biology, and the human sciences. Ecology is forced to
   become a divided discipline, developmental biology is stubbornly
   difficult to reconcile with evolutionary theory, and the majority of
   biologists and social scientists are still unhappy with evolutionary
   accounts of human behaviour. The incorporation of niche construction as
   both a cause and a product of evolution removes these disciplinary
   boundaries while greatly generalizing the explanatory power of
   evolutionary theory.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that correlated behavioural traits, or
   behavioural syndromes, influence behavioural evolution in some taxa. Few
   studies, however, investigate whether the effects of a syndrome are the
   same for both sexes. We test whether variation in social tendency,
   inferred from interindividual distance, is correlated with other aspects
   of behaviour in male comb-footed spiders, Anelosimus studiosus. We
   compared these results to those from previous studies on female social
   tendency to determine (1) whether both sexes share the same behavioural
   syndrome and (2) whether its effects on mating success are the same for
   both sexes. Trait types in the syndrome analysis include foraging
   behaviour, anti-predator behaviour, exploratory behaviour and activity
   level. Our results suggest male A. studiosus, like females, can be
   categorized into two social classes: an aggregative (social) class and
   an intolerant (asocial) class. Social males (i.e. those with lower
   interindividual distance scores) were generally less aggressive towards
   prey and predators, and were less active. Furthermore, we provide
   evidence from a parent/offspring breeding study for an additive genetic
   component to male social tendency (heritability 0.32). To determine the
   influence of the male syndrome on mating success, we performed staged
   male-male contests between social and asocial males for access to
   females. We found that male social tendency was the single best
   predictor of success in these trials, with asocial males outperforming
   social. This finding is opposite to the trend observed in female A.
   studiosus, where social females experience higher mating success. We
   propose that the diametrically opposed mating outcomes between the sexes
   could generate evolutionary conflict. The Association for the Study of

Abstract = {{Females of many cercopithecine primates live in stable dominance
   hierarchies that create long-term asymmetries among sets of female
   relatives (matrilines) in access to limiting resources and shelter from

   widely documented, but their causes are unclear. Predicted breeding
   values from an animal model for female age of first reproduction are
   used to discriminate between shared additive genetic and shared
   environmental effects among the members of matrilines in a population of
   free-ranging rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). While age of first
   reproduction has a modest heritability (a parts per thousand 0.2),
   breeding values are distributed in a largely random fashion among
   matrilines and contribute little to the observed rank-related
   differences in average age of first reproduction. These results support
   the long-held, but previously unverified, contention that rank-related
   life history differences in female cercopithecine primates are the
   result of environmental rather than genetic differences among them.}},

Abstract = {{The equilibrium sequence diversity of genes within a population and the
   rate of sequence divergence between populations or species depends on a
   variety of factors, including expression pattern, mutation rate, nature
   of selection, random drift, and mating system. Here, we extend
   population genetic theory developed for maternal-effect genes to predict
   the equilibrium polymorphism within species and sequence divergence
   among species for genes with social effects on fitness. We show how the
   fitness effects of genes, mating system, and genetic system affect
   predicted gene polymorphism. We find that, because genes with indirect
   social effects on fitness effectively experience weaker selection, they
   are expected to harbor higher levels of polymorphism relative to genes
   with direct fitness effects. The relative increase in polymorphism is
   proportional to the inverse of the genetic relatedness between
   individuals expressing the gene and their social partners that
   experience the fitness effects of the gene. We find a similar pattern of
   more rapid divergence between populations or species for genes with
   indirect social effects relative to genes with direct effects. We focus
   our discussion on the social insects, organisms with diverse indirect
   genetic effects, mating and genetic systems, and we suggest specific
   examples for testing our predictions with emerging sociogenomic tools.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which occur when phenotypic expression
   in one individual is influenced by genes in another conspecific
   individual, may have a drastic effect on evolutionary response to
   selection. General evolutionary models of IGEs have been developed using
   two distinct theoretical frameworks derived from maternal effects
   theory. The first framework is trait-based and focuses on how phenotypes
   are influenced by specific traits in a social partner, with the strength
   of interactions defined by the matrix Psi. The second framework
   partitions total genetic variance into components representing direct
   effects, indirect effects, and the covariance between them, without
   identifying specific social traits responsible for IGEs. The latter
   framework has been employed more commonly by empiricists because the
   methods for estimating variance components are relatively
   straightforward. Here, we show how these two theoretical frameworks are
   related to each other and derive equations that can be used to translate
   between them. This translation leads to a generalized method that can be
   used to estimate Psi via standard quantitative genetic breeding designs
   or pedigrees from natural populations. This method can be used in a very
   general set of circumstances and is widely applicable to all IGEs,
   including maternal effects and other interactions among relatives.}},

Abstract = {{Honeybees (Apis mellifera) are able to regulate the brood nest
   temperatures within a narrow range between 32 and 36A degrees C. Yet
   this small variation in brood temperature is sufficient to cause
   significant differences in the behavior of adult bees. To study the
   consequences of variation in pupal developmental temperature we raised
   honeybee brood under controlled temperature conditions (32, 34.5, 36A
   degrees C) and individually marked more than 4,400 bees, after
   emergence. We analyzed dancing, undertaking behavior, the age of first
   foraging flight, and forager task specialization of these workers.
   Animals raised under higher temperatures showed an increased probability
   to dance, foraged earlier in life, and were more often engaged in
   undertaking. Since the temperature profile in the brood nest may be an
   emergent property of the whole colony, we discuss how pupal
   developmental temperature can affect the overall organization of
   division of labor among the individuals in a self-organized process.}},

Abstract = {{Heritable variation in traits can have wide-ranging impacts on species
   interactions, but the effects that ongoing evolution has on the temporal
   ecological dynamics of communities are not well understood. Here, we
   identify three conditions that, if experimentally satisfied, support the
   hypothesis that evolution by natural selection can drive ecological
   changes in communities. These conditions are: (i) a focal population
   exhibits genetic variation in a trait(s), (ii) there is measurable
   directional selection on the trait(s), and (iii) the trait(s) under
   selection affects variation in a community variable(s). When these
   conditions are met, we expect evolution by natural selection to cause
   ecological changes in the community. We tested these conditions in a
   field experiment examining the interactions between a native plant
   (Oenothera biennis) and its associated arthropod community (more than 90
   spp.). Oenothera biennis exhibited genetic variation in several plant
   traits and there was directional selection on plant biomass,
   life-history strategy (annual versus biennial reproduction) and
   herbivore resistance. Genetically based variation in biomass and
   life-history strategy consistently affected the abundance of common
   arthropod species, total arthropod abundance and arthropod species
   richness. Using two modelling approaches, we show that evolution by
   natural selection in large O. biennis populations is predicted to cause
   changes in the abundance of individual arthropod species, increases in
   the total abundance of arthropods and a decline in the number of
   arthropod species. In small O. biennis populations, genetic drift is
   predicted to swamp out the effects of selection, making the evolution of
   plant populations unpredictable. In short, evolution by natural
   selection can play an important role in affecting the dynamics of
   communities, but these effects depend on several ecological factors. The
   framework presented here is general and can be applied to other systems
   to examine the community-level effects of ongoing evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Social status is an important phenotypic trait that determines
   fitness-relevant parameters. In many mammalian societies, offspring
   acquire a social position at adulthood similar to that held by their
   mother ({''}rank inheritance{''}) and thus obtain fitness benefits
   associated with this status. Mothers may influence the rank of their
   offspring at adulthood in at least three distinct ways. Firstly, the
   direct genetic inheritance of maternal traits that influence resource
   holding potential might predispose offspring to obtain a rank similar to
   that held by their mother. Secondly, the prenatal maternal environment
   might influence offspring rank if fetal exposure to maternal androgens
   is related to maternal status and affects offspring competitiveness.
   Thirdly, maternal behavioral support, a component of the postnatal
   maternal environment, may help offspring dominate individuals
   subordinate to their mother, thereby assisting offspring to acquire a
   rank similar to that of their mother. Here, we simultaneously test
   predictions derived from these three potential maternal effects on
   offspring rank acquisition at adulthood, using cases of offspring
   adoption in the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta. We demonstrate that the
   rank of adopted offspring at adulthood was similar to that of their
   surrogate mother and that the competitive ability of offspring at
   adulthood was best explained by postnatal maternal behavioral support.}},

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{Estimating quantitative genetic parameters ideally takes place in
   natural populations, but relatively few studies have overcome the
   inherent logistical difficulties. For this reason, no estimates
   currently exist for the genetic basis of life-history traits in natural
   populations of large marine vertebrates. And yet such estimates are
   likely to be important given the exposure of this taxon to changing
   selection pressures, and the relevance of life-history traits to
   population productivity. We report such estimates from a long-term
   (1995-2007) study of lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) conducted at
   Bimini, Bahamas. We obtained these estimates by genetically
   reconstructing a population pedigree (117 dams, 487 sires, and 1351
   offspring) and then using an ``animal model{''} approach to estimate
   quantitative genetic parameters. We find significant additive genetic
   (co)variance, and hence moderate heritability, for juvenile length and
   mass. We also find substantial maternal effects for these traits at
   age-0, but not age-1, confirming that genotype-phenotype interactions
   between mother and offspring are strongest at birth; although these
   effects could not be parsed into their genetic and nongenetic
   components. Our results suggest that human-imposed selection pressures
   (e.g., size-selective harvesting) might impose noteworthy evolutionary
   change even in large marine vertebrates. We therefore use our findings
   to explain how maternal effects may sometimes promote maladaptive
   juvenile traits, and how lemon sharks at different nursery sites may
   show ``constrained local adaptation.{''} We also show how
   single-generation pedigrees, and even simple marker-based regression
   methods, can provide accurate estimates of quantitative genetic
   parameters in at least some natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{Aggressive behaviours are necessarily expressed in a social context,
   such that individuals may be influenced by the phenotypes, and
   potentially the genotypes, of their social partners. Consequently, it
   has been hypothesized that indirect genetic effects (IGEs) arising from
   the social environment will provide a major source of heritable
   variation on which selection can act. However, there has been little
   empirical scrutiny of this to date. Here we test this hypothesis in an
   experimental population of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using
   quantitative genetic models of five aggression traits, we find
   repeatable and heritable differences in agonistic behaviours of focal
   individuals when presented with an opponent mouse. For three of the
   traits, there is also support for the presence of IGEs, and estimated
   correlations between direct and indirect genetic (rA(O,F)) effects were
   high. As a consequence, any selection for aggression in the focal
   individuals should cause evolution of the social environment as a
   correlated response. In two traits, strong positive rA(O,F) will cause
   the rapid evolution of aggression, while in a third case changes in the
   phenotypic mean will be constrained by negative covariance between
   direct and IGEs. Our results illustrate how classical analyses may miss
   important components of heritable variation, and show that a full
   understanding of evolutionary dynamics requires explicit consideration
   of the genetic component of the social environment.}},

Abstract = {{Modern evolutionary biology is founded on the Mendelian-genetic model of
   inheritance, but it is now clear that this model is incomplete.
   Empirical evidence shows that environment (encompassing all external
   influences on the genome) can impose transgenerational effects and
   generate heritable variation for a broad array of traits in animals,
   plants, and other organisms. Such effects can be mediated by the
   transmission of epigenetic, cytoplasmic, somatic, nutritional,
   environmental, and behavioral variation. Building on the work of many
   authors, we outline a general framework for conceptualizing nongenetic
   inheritance and its evolutionary implications. This framework shows
   that, by decoupling phenotypic change from the genotype, nongenetic
   inheritance can circumvent the limitations of genetic inheritance and
   thereby influence population dynamics and alter the fitness landscape.
   The weight of theory and empirical evidence indicates that nongenetic
   inheritance is a potent factor in evolution that can engender outcomes
   unanticipated under the Mendelian-genetic model.}},

Title = {{Testing the Viviparity-Driven-Conflict Hypothesis: Parent-Offspring
   Conflict and the Evolution of Reproductive Isolation in a Poeciliid Fish}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of viviparity increases the potential for genomic
   conflicts between mothers and offspring over the level of maternal
   investment. The viviparity-driven-conflict hypothesis predicts that such
   conflicts will drive the evolution of asymmetrical reproductive
   isolation between populations with divergent mating systems. We tested
   this hypothesis using crosses between populations of a poeciliid fish
   that differ in their level of polyandry. Our results support the
   prediction of an asymmetry in the rate of spontaneous abortion in
   reciprocal crosses, with the highest rate occurring in crosses between
   females from a relatively monandrous population and males from a
   relatively polyandrous population. The patterns of offspring size were
   not consistent with the pattern predicted by the
   viviparity-driven-conflict hypothesis: crosses between a monandrous
   female and a polyandrous male did not produce larger offspring than the
   reciprocal cross. This discrepancy was due to the presence of an effect
   of the maternal population on offspring size: polyandrous females
   produced larger offspring than monandrous females. In addition,
   offspring size was positively correlated with maternal size in crosses
   involving a polyandrous male. We discuss these results in light of
   models for intra- and intergenomic epistasis and the rapid origin of
   asymmetric reproductive isolation in viviparous taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the well-known, long-term, organizational actions of sex
   steroids on phenotypic differences between the sexes, studies of
   maternal steroids in the vertebrate egg have mainly focused on effects
   seen in early life. Long-term organizational effects of yolk hormones on
   adult behavior and the underlying mechanisms that generate them have
   been largely ignored. Using an experiment in which hand-reared house
   sparrows (Passer domesticus) from testosterone- or control-treated eggs
   were kept under identical conditions, we show that testosterone
   treatment in the egg increased the frequency of aggressive, dominance,
   and sexual behavior of 1-year-old, reproductively competent house
   sparrows. We also show that circulating plasma levels of progesterone,
   testosterone, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, and 17 beta-estradiol did not
   differ between treatment groups. Thus, a simple change in adult gonadal
   hormone secretion is not the primary physiological cause of long-term
   effects of maternal steroids on adult behavior. Rather, differences in
   adult behavior caused by exposure to yolk testosterone during embryonic
   development are likely generated by organizational modifications of
   brain function. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that
   hormone-mediated maternal effects are an epigenetic mechanism causing
   intra-sexual variation in adult behavioral phenotype. (c) 2008 Wiley

Abstract = {{Egg quality may mediate maternal allocation strategies according to
   progeny sex. In vertebrates, carotenoids have important physiological
   roles during embryonic and post-natal life, but the consequences of
   variation in yolk carotenoids for offspring phenotype in oviparous
   species are largely unknown. In yellow-legged gulls, yolk carotenoids
   did not vary with embryo sex in combination with egg laying date, order
   and mass. Yolk lutein supplementation enhanced the growth of sons from
   first eggs but depressed that of sons from last eggs, enhanced survival
   of daughters late in the season, and promoted immunity of male chicks
   and chicks from small eggs. Lack of variation in egg carotenoids in
   relation to sex and egg features, and the contrasting effects of lutein
   on sons and daughters, do not support the hypothesis of optimal
   sex-related egg carotenoid allocation. Carotenoids transferred to the
   eggs may rather result from a trade-off between opposing effects on sons
   or daughters.}},

Abstract = {{Repetitive plant parts such as seeds can be characterized at the
   within-individual level not only by average values but also by higher
   moments of their distributions, such its the standard deviation,
   skewness, and kurtosis. These parameters can potentially be adaptive and
   shaped by selection like any other individual trait, but tend to be
   understudied. We present an example of how within-individual variation
   might be studied. We used a diallel crossing design to investigate the
   sources of phenotypic variance of among- and within-individual variation
   in seed and germination traits of the endemic columbine Aquilegia
   pyrenaica subsp. cazorlensis (Heywood) Galiano \& Rivas Martinez.
   Individual plants and even fruits have their characteristic mean,
   standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis and therefore these
   parameters could potentially respond to selection. However, we only
   found evidence of genetic variance in mean within-fruit seed mass, mean
   time to seedling emergence. and number of seeds: these effects were
   attributable to maternal effects. Variance in higher moments of the
   within-fruit distributions in this species could instead reflect
   developmental instability or plastic responses to localized
   environmental conditions as fruits develop. Large sample sizes are
   required to make final conclusions in this case, but this study
   illustrates how the novel approach of considering high moments of
   intra-individual variation swill enhance our view of plant trait
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection is thought to favor the evolution of secondary sexual
   traits in males that contribute to mating success. In species where
   females mate with more than one male, sexual selection also continues
   after copulation in the form of sperm competition and cryptic female
   choice. Theory suggests that sperm competition should favor traits such
   as testes size and sperm production that increase a male's competitive
   fertilization success. Studies of experimental evolution offer a
   powerful approach for assessing evolutionary responses to variation in
   sexual selection pressures. Here we removed sexual selection by
   enforcing monogamy on replicate lines of a naturally polygamous horned
   beetle, Onthophagus taut-us, and monitoring male investment in their
   testes for 21 generations. Testes size decreased in monogamous lines
   relative to lines in which sexual selection was allowed to continue.
   Differences in testes size were dependent on selection history and not
   breeding regime. Males from polygamous lines also had a competitive
   fertilization advantage when in sperm competition with males from
   monogamous lines. Females from polygamous lines produced sons in better
   condition, and those from monogamous lines increased their sons
   condition by mating polygamously. Rather than being costly for females,
   multiple mating appears to provide females with direct and/or indirect
   benefits. Neither body size nor horn size diverged between our
   monogamous and polygamous lines. Our data show that sperm competition
   does drive the evolution of testes size in onthophagine beetles, and
   provide general support for sperm competition theory.}},

Pages = {{1373-1383}},
Month = {{SEP 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: The social life of animals depends on communication between
   individuals. Recent studies in Drosophila melanogaster demonstrate that
   various behaviors are influenced by social interactions. For example,
   courtship is a social interaction mediated by pheromonal signaling that
   occurs more frequently during certain times of the day than others. In
   adult flies, sex pheromones are synthesized in cells called oenocytes
   and displayed on the surface of the cuticle. Although the role of
   Drosophila pheromones in sexual behavior is well established, little is
   known about the timing of these signals or how their regulation is
   influenced by the presence of other flies.
   Results: We report that oenocytes contain functional circadian clocks
   that appear to regulate the synthesis of pheromones by controlling the
   transcription of desaturase1 (desat1), a gene required for production of
   male cuticular sex pheromones. Moreover, levels of these pheromones vary
   throughout the day in a pattern that depends on the clock genes and most
   likely also depends on the circadian control of desat1 in the oenocytes.
   To assess group dynamics, we manipulated the genotypic composition of
   social groups (single versus mixed genotypes). This manipulation
   significantly affects clock gene transcription both in the head and
   oenocytes, and it also affects the pattern of pheromonal accumulation on
   the cuticle. Remarkably, we found that flies in mixed social groups mate
   more frequently than do their counterparts in uniform groups.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate that social context exerts a
   regulatory influence on the expression of chemical signals, while
   modulating sexual behavior in the fruit fly.}},

   the present study was to evaluate the genetic parameters and genetic
   trends for birth and weaning weights, and to quantify the inbreeding
   characteristics for a population of Zandi sheep. Genetic parameters from
   both single- and two-trait analyses were estimated Using restricted
   maximum likelihood (REML) with animal models. Genetic trends were
   estimated by averaging estimated breeding values on year of birth. Full
   pedigree was analyzed for estimation of inbreeding characteristics. The
   results obtained confirmed relatively low additive genetic variation in
   the population, especially for weaning weight, respectively. Estimates
   of breeding values averaged by year of birth for birth weight and
   weaning weight increased over time. However, there was little genetic
   progress for birth weight (0.002 kg yr(-1)), whereas the tendency for
   weaning weight was 0.020 kg yr(-1). Inbred animals consisted of 25\% of
   the population. The effective population size (Ne) was 66 individuals.
   The inbreeding rate per generation (Delta F) was 0.76\%. The average
   value of inbreeding (F) in the Zandi population was 1.05\% and the
   average relatedness (AR) coefficient reached 1.64\% in the whole
   pedigree. A range of 2.84 to 4.01 yr was obtained for the average
   generation interval in different pathways. Selection of rams with the
   lowest AR was recommended for better management of inbreeding and
   avoidance of relative mating.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions experienced by a female prior to reproducing
   may be influenced by her mate. Part of such an indirect effect of a male
   on his partner's reproduction may be genetic (indirect genetic effect).
   However, a female's direct and a male's indirect genetic effects need
   not align. We analyzed 10,652 records of seasonal timing of laying, an
   important reproductive trait in many organisms, of 1864 male and 1916
   female common gulls Larus canus collected during 37 years. We show that
   there is both a direct (female) and an indirect (male) genetic effect
   (explaining 14.5\% and 4.8\% of the REML estimated variance in laying
   date, respectively), but these are significantly negatively correlated
   (-0.53 +/- 0.22 SE), indicating that genes for early laying in females
   are associated with genes for a delaying male effect on his partner's
   laying date (and vice versa). There is strong selection for laying early
   in this population, and these sexually antagonistic genetic effects may
   contribute in maintaining the variation in laying date. Our findings
   provide an empirical demonstration of a hitherto largely unstudied level
   of conflict between mates, with important ramifications for our
   understanding of evolutionary dynamics and mate choice in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Growing evidence indicates that females actively engage in polyandry
   either to avoid genetic incompatibility or to bias paternity in favor of
   genetically superior males. Despite empirical support for the intrinsic
   male quality hypothesis, the maintenance of variation in male fitness
   remains a conundrum for traditional ``good genes'' models of sexual
   selection. Here, we discuss two mechanisms of non-Mendelian inheritance,
   maternal inheritance of mitochondria and epigenetic regulation of gene
   expression, which may explain the persistence of variation in male
   fitness traits important in post-copulatory sexual selection. The
   inability of males to transmit mitochondria precludes any direct
   evolutionary response to selection on mitochondrial mutations that
   reduce or enhance male fitness. Consequently, mitochondrial- based
   variation in sperm traits is likely to persist, even in the face of
   intense sperm competition. Indeed, mitochondrial nucleotide
   substitutions, deletions and insertions are now known to be a primary
   cause of low sperm count and poor sperm motility in humans.
   Paradoxically, in the field of sexual selection, female-limited response
   to selection has been largely overlooked. Similarly, the contribution of
   epigenetics (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding
   RNAs) to heritable variation in male fitness has received little
   attention from evolutionary theorists. Unlike DNA sequence based
   variation, epigenetic variation can be strongly influenced by
   environmental and stochastic effects experienced during the lifetime of
   an individual. Remarkably, in some cases, acquired epigenetic changes
   can be stably transmitted to offspring. A recent study indicates that
   sperm exhibit particularly high levels of epigenetic variation both
   within and between individuals. We suggest that such epigenetic
   variation may have important implications for post-copulatory sexual
   selection and may account for recent findings linking sperm competitive
   ability to offspring fitness.}},

Abstract = {{In theory, females of many species choose mates based on traits that are
   indicators of male genetic quality. A fundamental question in
   evolutionary biology is why genetic variation for such indicator traits
   persists despite strong persistent selection imposed by female
   preference, which is known as the lek paradox. One potential solution to
   the lek paradox suggests that the traits that are targets of mate choice
   should evolve condition-dependent expression and that condition should
   have a large genetic variance. Condition is expected to exhibit high
   genetic variance because it is affected by a large number of
   physiological processes and hence, condition-dependent traits should
   `capture' variation contributed by a large number of loci. We suggest
   that a potentially important cause of variation in condition is
   competition for limited resources. Here, we discuss a pair of models to
   analyze the evolutionary genetics of traits affected by success in
   social competition for resources. We show that competition can
   contribute to genetic variation of `competition-dependent' traits that
   have fundamentally different evolutionary properties than other sources
   of variation. Competition dependence can make traits honest indicators
   of genetic quality by revealing the relative competitive ability of
   males, can provide a component of heritable variation that does not
   contribute to trait evolution, and can help maintain heritable variation
   under directional selection. of competition dependence and briefly
   introduce two models to demonstrate the potential evolutionary
   consequences of competition-dependent trait expression.}},

Abstract = {{Kin and levels-of-selection models are common approaches for modelling
   social evolution. Indirect genetic effect (IGE) models represent a
   different approach, specifying social effects on trait values rather
   than fitness. We investigate the joint effect of relatedness, multilevel
   selection and IGEs on response to selection. We present a measure for
   the degree of multilevel selection, which is the natural partner of
   relatedness in expressions for response. Response depends on both
   relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection, rather than only one
   or the other factor. Moreover, response is symmetric in relatedness and
   the degree of multilevel selection, indicating that both factors have
   exactly the same effect. Without IGEs, the key parameter is the product
   of relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection. With IGEs,
   however, multilevel selection without relatedness can explain evolution
   of social traits. Thus, next to relatedness and multilevel selection,
   IGEs are a key element in the genetical theory of social evolution.}},

Abstract = {{According to neutral quantitative genetic theory, population bottlenecks
   are expected to decrease standing levels of additive genetic variance of
   quantitative traits. However, some empirical and theoretical results
   suggest that, if nonadditive genetic effects influence the trait,
   bottlenecks may actually increase additive genetic variance. This has
   been an important issue in conservation genetics where it has been
   suggested that small population size might actually experience an
   increase rather than a decrease in the rate of adaptation. Here we test
   if bottlenecks can break a selection limit for desiccation resistance in
   the rain forest-restricted fly Drosophila bunnanda. After one generation
   of single-pair mating, additive genetic variance for desiccation
   resistance increased to a significant level, on average higher than for
   the control lines. Line crosses revealed that both dominance and
   epistatic effects were responsible for the divergence in desiccation
   resistance for desiccation resistance. However, when bottlenecked lines
   were selected for increased desiccation resistance, there was only a
   small shift in resistance, much less than predicted by the released
   additive genetic variance. The small selection response in the
   bottlenecked lines was no greater than that observed in the control
   lines. Thus bottlenecks might produce a statistically detectable change
   in additive genetic variance but this change has no impact on the
   response to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of postcopulatory sexual selection typically estimate a male's
   fertilization success from his paternity success (P-2) calculated at
   hatching or birth. However, P-2 may be affected by differential embryo
   viability, thereby confounding estimations of true fertilization success
   (F-2) This study examines the effects of variation in the ability of
   males to influence embryo viability upon the inequality between P-2 and
   F-2. It also investigates the consequences of this inequality for
   testing the hypothesis that polyandrous females accrue viability
   benefits for their offspring through facilitation of sperm competition
   (good-sperm model). Simulations of competitive mating trials show that
   although relative measures of male reproductive success tend to
   underestimate the strength of underlying good-sperm processes,
   good-sperm processes can be seriously overestimated using P-2 values if
   males influence the viability of the embryos they sire. This study
   cautions the interpretation of P-2 values as a proxy for fertilization
   success or sperm competitiveness in studies of postcopulatory sexual
   selection, and highlights that the good-sperm hypothesis needs empirical
   support from studies able to identify and separate unequivocally the
   males' ability to win fertilizations from their ability to influence the

Abstract = {{Sexual selection requires social interactions, particularly between the
   sexes. When trait expression is influenced by social interactions, such
   traits are called interacting phenotypes and only recently have the
   evolutionary consequences of interacting phenotypes been considered.
   Here we investigated how variation in relative fitness, or the
   opportunity for sexual selection, affected the evolutionary trajectories
   of interacting phenotypes. We used experimentally evolved populations of
   the naturally promiscuous Drosophila pseudoobscura, in which the numbers
   of potential interactions between the sexes, and therefore relative
   fitness, were manipulated by altering natural levels of female
   promiscuity. We considered two different mating interactions between the
   sexes: mating speed and copulation duration. We investigated the
   evolutionary trajectories of means and (co)variances (P) and also the
   influence of genetic drift on the evolutionary response of these
   interactions. Our sexual selection treatments did not affect the means
   of either mating speed or copulation duration, but they did affect P. We
   found that the means of both traits differed among replicates within
   each selection treatment whereas the Ps did not. Changes as a
   consequence of genetic drift were excluded. Our results show that
   although variable potential strengths of sexual interactions influence
   the evolution of interacting phenotypes, the influence may be nonlinear.}},

Abstract = {{Dominance status and reproductive experience are maternal
   characteristics that affect offspring traits in diverse taxa, including
   some cercopithecine primates. Maternal effects of this sort are
   widespread and are sources of variability in offspring fitness. We
   tested the hypothesis that maternal dominance rank and reproductive
   experience as well as a male's own age and dominance rank predicted
   chronic fecal glucocorticoid (fGC) concentrations in 17 subadult wild
   male baboons, Papio cynocephalus (median age 6.5 years), in the Amboseli
   basin, Kenya. Among these variables, maternal dominance rank at a
   subadult male's conception was the sole significant predictor of the
   male's fGC and accounted for 42\% of fGC variance: sons of lower ranking
   mothers had higher fGC than did those of high-ranking mothers. This
   result is striking because subadult male baboons are approximately 4-6
   Years past the period of infant dependence on their mothers, and are
   larger than and dominant to all adult females. In addition, many males
   of this age have survived their mothers' death. Consequently, the
   influence of maternal dominance rank persisted well beyond the stage at
   which direct maternal influence on sons is likely. Persistence of these
   major maternal influences from the perinatal period may signal
   organizational effects of mothers on sons' HPA axis. Although
   short-term, acute, elevations in GC are part of adaptive responses to
   challenges such as predators and other emergencies, chronically elevated
   GC are often associated with stress-related pathologies and, thereby,
   adverse effects on fitness components. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Explaining how interactions between genes and the environment influence
   social behavior is a fundamental research goal, yet there is limited
   relevant information for species exhibiting natural variation in social
   organization. The fire ant Solenopsis invicta is characterized by a
   remarkable form of social polymorphism, with the presence of one or
   several queens per colony and the expression of other phenotypic and
   behavioral differences being completely associated with allelic
   variation at a single Mendelian factor marked by the gene Gp-9.
   Microarray analyses of adult workers revealed that differences in the
   Gp-9 genotype are associated with the differential expression of an
   unexpectedly small number of genes, many of which have predicted
   functions, implying a role in chemical communication relevant to the
   regulation of colony queen number. Even more surprisingly, worker gene
   expression profiles are more strongly influenced by indirect effects
   associated with the Gp-9 genotypic composition within their colony than
   by the direct effect of their own Gp-9 genotype. This constitutes an
   unusual example of an ``extended phenotype'' and suggests a complex

Pages = {{899-905}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Threshold models are useful for understanding the evolution of dimorphic
   traits with polygenic bases. Selection for threshold characters on
   individuals is expected to be frequency dependent because of the
   peculiar way that selection views underlying genetic and environmental
   factors. Selection among individuals is inefficient because individual
   phenotypes fall into only two discrete categories that map imperfectly
   to the underlying genes. Incidence, however, can be continuously
   distributed among groups, making among-group selection relatively more
   efficient. Differently put, the group-mean phenotype can be a better
   predictor of an individual's genotype than that individual's own
   phenotype. Because evolution in group-structured populations is governed
   by the balance of selection within and between groups, we can expect
   threshold traits to evolve in fundamentally different ways when group
   mean fitness is a function of morph frequency. We extend the theory of
   selection on threshold traits to include group selection using
   contextual analysis. For the simple case of linear group-fitness
   functions, we show that the group-level component of selection, like the
   individual-level component, is frequency dependent. However, the
   conditions that determine which component dominates when levels of
   selection are in conflict (as described by Hamilton's rule) are not
   frequency dependent. Thus, enhanced group selection is not an inherent
   property of threshold characters. Nevertheless, we show that predicting
   the effects of multiple levels of selection on dimorphic traits requires
   special considerations of the threshold model.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypic development is the result of a complex interplay involving
   the organism's own genetic make-up and the environment it experiences
   during development. The latter encompasses not just the current
   environment, but also indirect, and sometimes lagged, components that
   result from environmental effects on its parents that are transmitted to
   their developing offspring in various ways and at various stages. These
   environmental effects can simply constrain development, for example,
   where poor maternal condition gives rise to poorly provisioned,
   low-quality offspring. However, it is also possible that environmental
   circumstances during development shape the offspring phenotype in such a
   way as to better prepare it for the environmental conditions it is most
   likely to encounter during its life. Studying the extent to which direct
   and indirect developmental responses to environmental effects are
   adaptive requires clear elucidation of hypotheses and careful
   experimental manipulations. In this paper, I outline how the different
   paradigms applied in this field relate to each other, the main
   predictions that they produce and the kinds of experimental data needed
   to distinguish among competing hypotheses. I focus on birds in
   particular, but the theories discussed are not taxon specific.
   Environmental influences on phenotypic development are likely to be
   mediated, in part at least, by endocrine systems. I examine evidence
   from mechanistic and functional avian studies and highlight the general
   areas where we lack key information.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated hatching is one of few defences available to embryos, and is
   effective against many egg-stage risks. We present the first analysis of
   genetic variation in hatching plasticity, examining premature hatching
   of American toad embryos in response to pathogenic water moulds. We
   reared eggs from half- and full-sib families in the presence and absence
   of water mould. Hatching age and hatchling size showed low
   cross-environment genetic correlations, suggesting that early-induced
   hatching can evolve largely independently of spontaneous hatching. We
   found less phenotypic and additive genetic variation for early-induced
   hatching than spontaneous hatching, and a stronger correlation between
   egg and induced hatchling sizes. Directional selection by the pathogen
   may have eroded variation in early-induced hatching, pushing it against
   the constraint of hatching gland development. Later hatching has a
   second, muscular component. This pattern of variation may characterize
   defences based on developmental transitions, although other inducible
   defences show more variation in induced phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are ubiquitous both in animals and
   in plants, and in natural as well as domestic populations. These
   interactions affect both the direction and the magnitude of responses to
   selection and are a key factor in evolutionary success of species and in
   the design of breeding schemes in agriculture. At present, however, very
   little is known of the contribution of social effects to heritable
   variance in trait values. Here we present estimates of the direct and
   social genetic variance in growth rate, feed intake, back fat thickness,
   and muscle depth in a population of 14,032 domestic pigs with known
   pedigree. Results show that social effects contribute the vast majority
   of heritable variance in growth rate and feed intake in this population.
   Total heritable variance expressed relative to phenotypic variance was
   71\% for growth rate and 70\% for feed intake. These values clearly
   exceed the usual range of heritability for those trait. Back fat
   thickness and muscle depth showed no heritable variance due to social
   effects. Our results suggest that genetic improvement in agriculture can
   be substantially advanced by redirecting breeding schemes, so as to
   capture heritable variance due to social effect.}},

Abstract = {{The evolutionary importance of maternal effects is determined by the
   interplay of maternal adaptations and strategies, offspring
   susceptibility to these strategies, and the similarity of selection
   pressures between the two generations. Interaction among these
   components, especially in species where males and females differ in the
   costs and requirements of growth, limits inference about the evolution
   of maternal strategies from their expression in the offspring phenotype
   alone. As an alternative approach, we examine divergence in the
   proximate mechanisms underlying maternal effects across three house
   finch populations with contrasting patterns of sex allocation: an
   ancestral population that shows no sex-biased ovulation, and two
   recently established populations at the northern and southern boundaries
   of the species range that have opposite sequences of ovulation of male
   and female eggs. For each population, we examined how oocyte acquisition
   of hormones, carotenoids and vitamins was affected by oocyte growth and
   overlap with the same and opposite sexes. Our results suggest that
   sex-specific acquisition of maternal resources and sex determination of
   oocytes are linked in this system. We report that acquisition of
   testosterone by oocytes that become males was not related to growth
   duration, but instead covaried with temporal exposure to steroids and
   overlap with other male oocytes. In female oocytes, testosterone
   acquisition increased with the duration of growth and overlap with male
   oocytes, but decreased with overlap with female oocytes. By contrast,
   acquisition of carotenoids and vitamins was mostly determined by
   organism-wide partitioning among oocytes and oocyte-specific patterns of
   testosterone accumulation, and these effects did not differ between the
   sexes. These results provide important insights into three unresolved
   phenomena in the evolution of maternal effects - (i) the evolution of
   sex-specific maternal allocation in species with simultaneously
   developing neonates of both sexes; (ii) the link between sex
   determination and sex-specific acquisition of maternal products; and
   (iii) the evolution of context-dependent modulation of maternal effects.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The paradoxical persistence of heritable variation for fitness-related
   traits is an evolutionary conundrum that remains a preeminent problem in
   evolutionary biology. Here we describe a simple mechanism in which
   social competition results in the evolutionary maintenance of heritable
   variation for fitness related traits. We demonstrate this mechanism
   using a genetic model with two primary assumptions: the expression of a
   trait depends upon success in social competition for limited resources;
   and competitive success of a genotype depends on the genotypes that it
   competes against. We find that such social competition generates
   heritable (additive) genetic variation for ``competition-dependent{''}
   traits. This heritable variation is not eroded by continuous directional

Abstract = {{Mortality due to cannibalism is a major problem in laying hens. Due to
   prohibition of beak-trimming in the European Union, this problem will
   increase in the near future. One solution to reduce mortality due to
   cannibalism is to use genetic selection. Mortality due to cannibalism,
   however, differs from conventional breeding traits, because it depends
   on social interactions among individuals. Selection strategies aiming to
   reduce cannibalism, therefore, should consider both the direct effect of
   an individual on its own survival and the social effect of the
   individual on the survival of its group members (the so-called
   associative effect). Traditional breeding, however, accounts for only
   the direct effect. Recently, methods have been proposed to estimate
   variance components and breeding values for both direct and associative
   effects. This paper presents estimated genetic parameters for direct and
   associative effects on survival days in 3 purebred laying lines. For the
   analysis, 16,780 hens with intact beaks were used. When considering only
   direct effects, heritabilities ranged from 2 through 10\%. When
   considering both direct and associative effects, the total heritable
   variance, expressed as a proportion of phenotypic variance, ranged from
   6 through 19\%. These results show that heritable variation in survival
   days is substantially larger than suggested by conventional direct
   effects models. This means that prospects for reducing mortality by
   means of genetic selection are good and may lead to substantial
   reduction of 1 of the major welfare problems in egg production.}},

Abstract = {{Two critiques of simple adaptationism are distinguished:
   anti-adaptationism and extended adaptationism. Adaptationists and
   anti-adaptationists share the presumption that an evolutionary
   explanation should identify the dominant simple cause of the
   evolutionary outcome to be explained. A consideration of
   extended-adaptationist models such as coevolution, niche construction
   and extended phenotypes reveals the inappropriateness of this
   presumption in explaining the evolution of certain important kinds of
   features-those that play particular roles in the regulation of organic
   processes, especially behavior. These biological or behavioral `levers'
   are distinctively available for adaptation and exaptation by their
   possessors and for co-optation by other organisms. As a result they are
   likely to result from a distinctive and complex type of evolutionary
   process that conforms neither to simple adaptationist nor to
   anti-adaptationist styles of explanation. Many of the human features
   whose evolutionary explanation is most controversial belong to this
   category, including the female orgasm.}},

Abstract = {{An animal model was used to estimate direct and maternal genetic
   parameters for birth weight (BW), weaning weight (WW), 9-month weight
   (W9) and yearling weight (YW) for a population of Zandi sheep. The
   magnitude of estimates of these parameters was used to evaluate the
   importance of direct and matemal influences on body weight at various
   stages of Zandi lambs' life. Results confirmed the potential maternal
   influences to change pattern of body weight's heritability with age.
   Maternal influences were significant for early growth traits. The
   importance of maternal influences diminished with age, although for W9
   and YW those effects did not disappear completely. In contrast to
   variation due to maternal effects, the variance of direct effects
   increased from birth to a year of age. Estimates of maternal breeding
   values averaged by year of birth decreased throughout the experiment for
   both BW and WW. It was concluded that for more precise designing
   selection programs and, in consequence, increasing efficiency of
   selection, inclusion of maternal effects as well as direct-maternal
   genetic covariance into the model, especially for early growth traits,
   is necessary.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A general feature of the demography of large ungulates is that many
   demographic traits are dependent on female body mass at early ages.
   Thus, identifying the factors affecting body mass variation can give
   important mechanistic understanding of demographic processes. Here we
   relate individual variation in autumn and winter body mass of moose
   calves living at low density on an island in northern Norway to
   characteristics of their mother, and examine how these relationships are
   affected by annual variation in population density and climate. Body
   mass increased with increasing age of their mother, was lower for calves
   born late in the spring, decreased with litter size and was larger for
   males than for female calves. No residual effects of variation in
   density and climate were present after controlling for annual variation
   in mother age and calving date. The annual variation in adult female age
   structure and calving date explained a large part (71-75\%) of the
   temporal variation in calf body mass. These results support the
   hypotheses that (a) body mass of moose calves are affected by qualities
   associated with mother age (e.g. body condition, calving date); and (b)
   populations living at low densities are partly buffered against temporal
   fluctuations in the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Non-genetic parental effects may largely affect offspring phenotype, and
   such plasticity is potentially adaptive. Despite its potential
   importance, little is known about cross-generational effects of

   considered a troublesome nuisance, rather than a target of experimental
   studies. We here investigate effects of parental, developmental and
   acclimation temperature on life-history traits in the butterfly Bicyclus
   anynana. Higher developmental temperatures reduced development times and
   egg size, increased egg number, but did not affect pupal mass.
   Between-generation temperature effects on larval time, pupal time,
   larval growth rate and egg size were qualitatively very similar to
   effects of developmental temperature, and additionally affected pupal
   mass but not egg number. Parental effects are important mediators of
   phenotypic plasticity in B. anynana, and partly yielded antagonistic
   effects on different components of fitness, which may constrain the
   evolution of cross-generational adaptive plasticity. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Journal = {{MALARIA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: The environmental conditions experienced by parents are
   increasingly recognized to impact the success of offspring. Little is
   known on the presence of such parental effects in Anopheles. If present,
   parental effects could influence mosquito breeding programmes, some
   malaria control measures and have epidemiological and evolutionary
   consequences.
   Methods: The presence of parental effects on offspring emergence time,
   size, survival, blood meal size and fecundity in laboratory reared An.
   stephensi were tested.
   Results: Parental rearing conditions did not influence the time taken
   for offspring to emerge, or their size or survival as adults. However,
   parental effects were influential in determining the fecundity of
   daughters. Counter- intuitively, daughters of parents reared in low food
   conditions produced larger egg clutches than daughters of parents reared
   in high food conditions. Offspring reared in low food conditions took
   larger blood meals if their parents had also experienced a low food
   environment.
   Conclusion: So far as we are aware, this is the first evidence of
   parental effects on progeny in Anopheles.}},

Abstract = {{Expression of colony social organization in fire ants appears to be
   under the control of a single Mendelian factor of large effect.
   Variation in colony queen number in Solenopsis invicta and its relatives

   variation at other unlinked genes; workers regulate queen identity and
   number on the basis of Gp-9 genotypic compatibility. Nongeneticfactors,
   such as prior social experience, queen reproductive status, and local
   environment, have negligible effects on queen number which illustrates
   the nearly complete penetrance of Gp-9. As predicted, queen number can
   be manipulated experimentally by altering worker Gp-9 genotype
   frequencies. The Gp-9 allele lineage associated with polygyny in South
   American fire? ants has been retained across multiple speciation events,
   which may signal the action of balancing selection to maintain social
   polymorphism in these species. Moreover positive selection is implicated
   in driving the molecular evolution of Gp-9 in association with the
   origin of polygyny. The identity of the product of Gp-9 as an
   odorant-binding protein suggests plausible scenarios for its direct
   involvement in the regulation of queen number via a role in chemical
   communication. While these and other lines of evidence show that Gp-9
   represents a legitimate candidate gene of major effect, studies aimed at
   determining (i) the biochemical pathways in which GP-9 functions; (ii)
   the phenotypic effects of molecular variation at Gp-9 and other pathway
   genes; and (iii) the potential involvement of genes in linkage
   disequilibrium with Gp-9 are needed to elucidate the genetic
   architecture underlying social organization in fire ants. Information
   that reveals the links between molecular variation, individual
   phenotype, and colony-level behaviors, combined with behavioral models
   that incorporate details of the chemical communication involved in
   regulating queen number will yield a novel integrated view of the
   evolutionary changes underlying a key social adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{The biological study of behavior was shaped by the divorce between
   ethology and behavioral ecology twenty years ago. Whereas the heirs of
   ethology promote a phenomenological study of behaviors, behavioral
   ecologists focus on their fitness consequences. I argue that both
   schools share the same blind spot about the link between evolutionary
   past and the making up of the individual because of their common
   acceptance of the dichotomy between ultimate and proximate causation. By
   maintaining a pan-selectionist view of evolution in the study of
   behavior, the dichotomy hampers exploring how epigenetic processes
   affect adaptive trade-offs. Giving up the dichotomy would give impetus
   to research programs that investigate how behavioral traits associate in
   clusters through development and evolution. It would further a
   comprehensive view of behavioral phenotypes, making the reunification of
   behavioral biology an attainable goal.}},

Abstract = {{We used capture-mark-recapture models to investigate the effects of both
   individual and parental heterozygosity, measured at microsatellite loci
   on the survival of Seychelles warblers (Acrocephalus sechellensis), an
   endemic island species which went through a severe population bottleneck
   in the middle of the last century. We found that an individual's
   survival was not correlated with multilocus heterozygosity, or with
   heterozygosity at any specific locus. However, maternal, but not
   paternal, multilocus heterozygosity was positively associated with
   offspring survival, but only in years with low survival probabilities. A
   nestling cross-fostering experiment showed that this was a direct
   maternal effect as there was an effect of the genetic mother's, but not
   of the social mother's, heterozygosity. Heterozygosity-fitness
   correlations at microsatellite markers were generally assumed to reflect
   genome-wide effects. Although this might be true in partially inbred
   populations, such correlations may also arise as a result of local
   effects with specific markers being closely linked to genes which
   determine fitness. However, heterozygosity at the individual
   microsatellite loci was not correlated and therefore does not seem to
   reflect genome-wide heterozygosity. This suggests that even in a small
   bottlenecked population, heterozygosity-fitness correlations may not be
   caused by genome-wide effects. Support for the local effects hypothesis
   was also equivocal; although three specific loci were associated with
   offspring survival, including all single-locus heterozygosities as
   independent predictors for the variation in survival was not supported
   by the data. Furthermore, in contrast to the local effects hypothesis,
   the loci which contributed most to the heterozygosity-survival
   relationship were not more polymorphic than the other loci. This study
   highlights the difficulties in distinguishing between the two
   hypotheses.}},

Abstract = {{What are the consequences of the natural variation in maternal body mass
   on offspring energetic performance? How are performance traits related
   to thermal physiology and energetics phenotypically integrated on
   offspring? To answer these questions, fifty breeding pairs of the common
   terrestrial isopod Porcellio laevis were set up in the lab.
   Physiological performance, thermal tolerance and thermal sensitivity
   were measured in 171 adults. Maternal effects were estimated as: the
   direct influence of maternal body mass and the variation associated with
   mothers. Phenotypic integration was evaluated using path analysis. Our
   results show that: (1) maternal body size affects positively offspring
   long-term metabolism, (2) maternal variation was significant in many of
   the physiological traits and (3) there is an intricate set of
   relationships among traits and importantly, that offspring exhibited
   compensational strategies among metabolism, thermal sensitivity and
   thermal tolerance traits. Even if we cannot clearly state whether these
   maternal influences were because of the genes or the environment that
   mothers provided and thus no predictions can be done regarding their
   evolutionary consequences, it seems clear that the role of maternal
   effects on physiology can no longer be ignored. In this sense, there's a
   lot to be gained by incorporating explicit experimental protocols to
   test for maternal effects. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{While evolution occurs when selection acts on a heritable trait,
   empirical studies of natural systems have frequently reported phenotypic
   stasis under these conditions. We performed quantitative genetic
   analyses of weight and hindleg length in a free-living population of
   Soay sheep (Ovis aries) to test whether genetic constraints can explain
   previously reported stasis in body size despite evidence for strong
   positive directional selection. Genetic, maternal and environmental
   covariance structures were estimated across ontogeny using random
   regression animal models. Heritability increased with age for weight and
   hindleg length, though both measures of size were highly heritable
   across ontogeny. Genetic correlations among ages were generally strong
   and uniformly positive, and the covariance structures were also highly
   integrated across ontogeny. Consequently, we found no constraint to the
   evolution of larger size itself. Rather we expect size at all ages to
   increase in response to positive selection acting at any age. Consistent
   with expectation, predicted breeding values for age-specific size traits
   have increased over a twenty-year period, while maternal performance for
   offspring size has declined. Re-examination of the phenotypic data
   confirmed that sheep are not getting larger, but also showed that there
   are significant negative trends in size at all ages. The genetic
   evolution is therefore cryptic, with the response to selection
   presumably being masked at the phenotypic level by a plastic response to
   changing environmental conditions. Density-dependence, coupled with
   systematically increasing population size, may contribute to declining
   body size but is insufficient to completely explain it. Our results
   demonstrate that an increased understanding of the genetic basis of
   quantitative traits, and of how plasticity and microevolution can occur
   simultaneously, is necessary for developing predictive models of
   phenotypic change in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects arise when genes expressed in one individual
   affect the expression of traits in other individuals. The importance of
   indirect genetic effects has been recognized for a diversity of
   evolutionary processes including kin selection, sexual selection,
   community structure and multilevel selection, but data regarding their
   genetic architecture and prevalence throughout the genome remain scarce,
   especially for interactions between unrelated individuals. Using a set
   of 411 Bay-0 x Shahdara Arabidopsis recombinant inbred lines grown with
   Landsberg neighbours, we examined quantitative trait loci (QTL) having
   direct and indirect effects on size, developmental, and fitness related
   traits. Using an interval mapping approach, we identified 15 QTL with
   direct effects and found that 13 of these QTL had significant indirect
   effects on trait expression in neighbouring plants. These results
   suggest widespread pleiotropy, as nearly all direct effect QTL have
   associated pleiotropic indirect effects. Paradoxically, most indirect
   effects were of the same sign as direct effects, creating a pattern of
   nearly universal positive pleiotropy that makes most covariances between
   direct and indirect effects positive. These results are consistent with
   a complex genetic basis for intraspecific interactions, but suggest that
   interactions between neighbouring plants are largely positive, rather
   than negative as would be expected for competition. In addition to their
   evolutionary and ecological importance, these pleiotropic relationships
   between DGE and IGE loci have implications for quantitative genetic
   studies of natural populations as well as experimental design
   considerations. Additionally, studies that ignore IGEs may over- or
   underestimate quantitative genetic parameters, as well as the effect of
   and variance contributed by QTL.}},

Abstract = {{Females often prefer males with elaborate traits, even when they receive
   no direct benefits from their choice. In such situations, mate
   discrimination presumably has genetic advantages; selective females will
   produce offspring of higher genetic quality. Over time, persistent
   female preferences for elaborate secondary-sexual traits in males should
   erode genetic variance in these traits, eventually eliminating any
   benefit to the preferences. Yet, strong female preferences persist in
   many taxa. This puzzle is called the lek paradox and raises two primary
   questions: do females obtain genetic benefits for offspring by selecting
   males with elaborate secondary-sexual characteristics and, if so, how is
   the genetic variation in these male traits maintained? We suggest that
   indirect genetic effects may help to resolve the lek paradox. Maternal
   phenotypes, such as habitat selection behaviours and offspring
   provisioning, often influence the condition and the expression of
   secondary-sexual traits in sons. These maternal influences are commonly
   genetic based (i.e. they are indirect genetic effects). Females choosing
   mates with elaborate traits may receive `good genes' for daughters in
   the form of effective maternal characteristics. Recognizing the
   significance of indirect genetic effects may be important to our
   understanding of the process and consequences of sexual selection.}},

Abstract = {{According to the differential investment hypothesis, females paired with
   attractive mates are expected to invest more in the current reproduction
   relative to females paired with unattractive males. We experimentally
   tested this hypothesis in the peafowl (Pavo cristatus) by providing
   females with males that differed in sexual attractiveness. In agreement
   with the differential allocation hypothesis, females paired with more
   ornamented males laid larger eggs, and deposited higher amounts of
   testosterone into the egg yolk, independently of the sex of the embryo.
   These results show that the association between paternal phenotype and
   offspring quality could arise via a differential maternal investment.
   They also suggest that, if ornamented males do transmit good genes to
   the progeny, the maternal differential investment can amplify the effect
   of such good genes on the offspring fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock populations are usually kept in groups. As a consequence,
   social interactions among individuals affect productivity, health, and
   welfare. Current selection methods (individual selection), however,
   ignore those interactions and yield suboptimal or in some cases even
   negative responses. In principle, selection between groups instead of
   individuals offers a solution, but has rarely been adopted in practice
   for two reasons. First, the relationship between group selection theory
   and common animal breeding concepts, such as the accuracy of selection,
   is nuclear. Second, application of group selection requires keeping
   selection candidates ill groups, which is often undesirable in practice.
   This work has two objectives. First, we derive expressions for the
   accuracy of individual and group selection, which provides a measurement
   of quality for those methods. Second, we investigate the opportunity to
   improve traits affected by interactions by rising information oil
   relatives kept. in family groups, while keeping selection candidates
   individually. The accuracy of selection based oil relatives is shown to
   be all analogy of the classical expression for traits not, affected by
   interactions. Our results show that selection based on relatives offers
   good opportunities for effective genetic improvement of traits affected
   by interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Although females are expected to maximize their reproductive success
   with only one or a few matings {[}1], the females of many species mate
   with multiple partners {[}2]. Experimental studies have found evidence
   for an increase in egg or embryo viability when females mate
   polyandrously {[}3]. These studies have been interpreted in the context
   of genetic-benefit models that propose that multiple mating increases
   offspring viability because it allows females to select male genotypes
   that influence viability directly or because it allows females to avoid
   genetic incompatibility {[}2, 4-8]. However, no studies have examined
   directly the precise mechanisms by which parents influence embryo
   viability. Using a morphological marker that enabled us to determine
   paternity and survival of embryos sired by individual male crickets in
   both sperm-competitive and -noncompetitive situations, we show that
   males inducing high embryo viability enhance the viability of embryos
   sired by inferior males. These results indicate that paternal effects
   and interacting phenotypes determine embryo viability. They show that a
   male's reproductive success is modified by the interaction between
   indirect genetic effects of sperm competitors. Importantly, our findings
   show that the benefits accruing to offspring of multiply mated females
   need not be transmitted genetically.}},

Abstract = {{Interaction among individuals is universal, both in animals and in
   plants, and substantially affects evolution of natural populations and
   responses to artificial selection in agriculture. Although quantitative
   genetics has successfully been applied to many traits, it does not
   provide a general theory accounting for interaction among individuals
   and selection acting on multiple levels. Consequently, Current
   quantitative genetic theory fails to explain why some traits do not
   respond to selection among individuals, but respond greatly to selection
   among groups. Understanding the full impacts of heritable interactions
   on the Outcomes of selection requires a quantitative genetic framework
   including all levels of selection and relatedness. Here we present such
   a framework and provide expressions for the response to selection.
   Results show that interaction among individuals may create substantial
   heritable variation, which is hidden to classical analyses. Selection
   acting on higher levels of organization captures this hidden variation
   and therefore always yields positive response, whereas individual
   selection may yield response in the opposite direction. Our work
   provides testable predictions of response to multilevel selection and
   reduces to classical theory in the absence of interaction. Statistical
   methodology provided elsewhere enables empirical application of our work
   to both natural and domestic populations.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions among individuals are universal, both in animals and in

   consequences of these interactions for the evolution of populations by
   either natural or artificial selection requires knowledge of the
   heritable components underlying them. Here we present statistical
   methodology to estimate the genetic parameters determining response to
   multilevel selection of traits affected by interactions among
   individuals in general populations. We apply these methods to obtain
   estimates of genetic parameters for survival, days in a population of
   layer chickens with high mortality due to pecking behavior. We find that
   heritable variation is threefold greater than that obtained from
   classical analyses, meaning that two-thirds of the full heritable
   variation is hidden to classical analysis due to social interactions. As
   a consequence, predicted responses to multilevel selection applied to
   this population are threefold greater than classical predictions. This
   work, combined with the quantitative genetic theory for response to
   multilevel selection presented in an accompanying article in this issue,
   enables the design of selection programs to effectively reduce

Abstract = {{Maternal effects increase phenotypic plasticity in offspring traits and
   may therefore facilitate adaptation to environmental variability.
   Carotenoids have been hypothesized to mediate costs of reproduction in
   females as well as maternal effects. However, assessing potential
   transgenerational and population consequences of environmental
   availability of carotenoids requires a better understanding of
   mechanisms of maternal effects mediated by these antioxidant pigments.
   Manipulating dietary availability of carotenoids to egg-laying female
   blue tits and subsequently cross-fostering nestlings between female
   treatments allowed us to specifically investigate the relative
   importance of maternal effects through egg carotenoids and through
   post-hatching care mediated by antioxidants in females. Nestling body
   size and mass and plasma antioxidants were not significantly affected by
   pre- or post-hatching maternal effects mediated by antioxidants,
   although both types of maternal effects in interaction explained the
   variation in growth, as measured by wing length. Development of the
   ability to mount a cell-mediated immune response as well as its temporal
   dynamics was influenced by both pre- and post-hatching maternal effects,
   with an advantage to nestlings originating from, or reared by,
   carotenoid-supplemented females. In addition, nestlings reared by
   carotenoid-fed females had a lower blood sedimentation rate, indicating
   that they may have been less infected than nestlings from controls.
   Finally, prehatching maternal effects in interaction with nestling
   plasma carotenoid levels affected the development of carotenoid-based
   plumage. Maternal effects mediated by carotenoids may thus act as a
   proximate factor in development and phenotypic plasticity in traits
   associated with nestling fitness, such as immune response and ability to
   metabolize and use antioxidants, and ultimately participate in the
   evolution of phenotypic traits.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the causes of variation in host immunity to parasitic
   infection and the time-scales over which variation persists, is integral
   to predicting the evolutionary and epidemiological consequences of
   host-parasite interactions. It is clear that offspring immunity can be
   influenced by parental immune experience, for example, reflecting
   transfer of antibodies from mothers to young offspring. However, it is
   less clear whether such parental effects persist or have functional
   consequences over longer time-scales, linking a parent's previous immune
   experience to future immune responsiveness in fully grown offspring. We
   used free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to quantify long-term
   effects of parental immune experience on offspring immune response. We
   experimentally vaccinated parents with a novel antigen and tested
   whether parental vaccination influenced the humoral antibody response
   mounted by fully grown offspring hatched the following year. Parental
   vaccination did not influence offspring baseline antibody titres.
   However, offspring of vaccinated mothers mounted substantially stronger
   antibody responses than offspring of unvaccinated mothers. Antibody
   responses did not differ between offspring of vaccinated and
   unvaccinated fathers. These data demonstrate substantial long-term
   effects of maternal immune experience on the humoral immune response of
   fully grown offspring in free-living birds.}},

Abstract = {{When social interactions occur, the phenotype of an individual is
   influenced directly by its own genes (direct genetic effects) but also
   indirectly by genes expressed in social partners (indirect genetic
   effects). Social insect colonies are characterized by extensive
   behavioral interactions among workers, brood, and queens so that
   indirect genetic effects are particularly relevant. I used a series of
   experimental manipulations to disentangle the contribution of direct
   effects, maternal (queen) effects, and sibsocial (worker) effects to
   variation for worker, gyne, and male mass; caste ratio; and sex ratio in
   the ant Temnothorax curvispinosus. The results indicate genetic variance
   for direct, maternal, and sibsocial effects for all traits, except for
   male mass there was no significant maternal variance, and for sex ratio
   the variance for direct effects was not separable from maternal variance
   for the primary sex ratio. Estimates of genetic correlations between
   direct, maternal, and sibsocial effects were generally negative,
   indicating that these effects may not evolve independently. These
   results have broad implications for social insect evolution. For
   example, the genetic architecture underlying social insect traits may
   constrain the realization of evolutionary conflicts between social
   partners.}},

Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1751-1762}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The niche-construction perspective within evolutionary biology places
   emphasis on the changes that organisms bring about in their selective
   environments. Advocates of this viewpoint argue that there is both
   accuracy and utility in treating niche construction as an evolutionary
   process in its own right, rather than merely as a product of evolution.
   Here we discuss and assess seven putative weaknesses of the
   niche-construction perspective. Niche construction has been neglected or
   rejected on the grounds that (1) it is not prevalent, (2) its study is
   not tractable, (3) it is not a process, (4) it is caused by natural
   selection, (5) it does not change our understanding of evolution in any
   fundamental way, (6) it does not bring about adaptation, and (7) it is
   not a single phenomenon. In each case, we critically evaluate the
   theoretical standing of these arguments and consider the empirical
   evidence that can be brought to bear on the debate. We conclude that
   none of these are strong criticisms of the niche-construction
   perspective and maintain that there are compelling reasons for treating
   niche construction as a major evolutionary process.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Carotenoid pigments have attracted much interest in behavioural and
   evolutionary ecology because of their dual function in immune physiology
   and as color signals. In vertebrates, carotenoids must ultimately be
   obtained from the diet, and the mechanisms and magnitude of this
   environmental dependence are central for understanding carotenoid signal
   functions and evolution. In the present cross-fostering experiment with
   great tits Parus major, we investigate pre- and postnatal parental
   effects (egg yolk carotenoids, parental coloration) on nestling size and
   carotenoid coloration, using HPLC analysis of egg yolk carotenoids, and
   a reflectance-based measure of `chroma' that reflects the plumage
   pigment concentration. Both rearing environment and origin influenced
   offspring size and plumage chroma. Maternal allocation of carotenoids to
   eggs had a weak positive effect on nestling plumage chroma, whereas we
   found no prenatal maternal effects (egg size or yolk carotenoid
   concentration) on size. Nestling plumage chroma was also significantly
   predicted by the chroma of the rearing father, but not by the color of
   the rearing mother or either of the original (genetical) parents. Thus,
   both prenatal maternal effects and postnatal paternal effects influence
   the carotenoid-based plumage coloration of nestling great tits. Future
   studies will reveal if parental effects have long-term consequences for
   plumage development and associated fitness components.}},

Abstract = {{The extent to which offspring resemble their parents in genotype and
   phenotype underpins patterns of genetic and phenotypic variation,
   selection, and evolution in natural populations. Genetic and phenotypic
   resemblance can clearly result from additive genetic variance and can be
   shaped by nongenetic parental and common environmental influences. In
   contrast, there is no straightforward expectation that inbreeding
   coefficient (f), a nonadditive component of genetic ``quality,{''}
   should be correlated across parents and offspring in sexually
   reproducing species or consequently cause resemblance across
   generations. Here, we report a significant parent f-offspring f
   correlation within a free-living pedigreed population of song sparrows
   (Melospiza melodia) on Mandarte Island, Canada. Across 15 years,
   relatively inbred parents had relatively inbred offspring on average. We
   show that rather than requiring nonrandom pairing with respect to f and
   kinship, parent f-offspring f correlations arise as an intrinsic
   consequence of random pairing within Mandarte's open population, where
   immigrants interbreed with Mandarte-hatched natives. However, on
   Mandarte, parent f offspring f correlations may have been exacerbated
   because relatively inbred individuals paired with more closely related
   mates than expected by chance. Such intrinsic parent f-offspring f
   correlations have major implications for the understanding of

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{207-217}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Vertebrate sex ratios are notorious for their lack of fit to theoretical
   models, both with respect to the direction and the magnitude of the sex
   ratio adjustment. The reasons for this are likely to be linked to
   simpilfying assumptions regarding vertebrate life histories. More
   specifically, if the sex ratio adjustment itself influences offspring
   fitness, due to sex-specific interactions among offspring, this could
   affect optimal sex ratios. A review of the literature suggests that
   sex-specific sibling interactions in vertebrates result from three major
   causes: (i) sex asymmetries in competitive ability, for example due to
   sexual dimorphism, (ii) sex-specific cooperation or helping, and (iii)
   sex asymmetries in non-competitive interactions, for example steroid
   leakage between fetuses. Incorporating sex-specific sibling interactions
   into a sex ratio model shows that the), will affect maternal sex ratio
   strategies and, under some conditions, can repress other selection
   pressures for sex ratio adjustment. Furthermore, sex-specific
   interactions could also explain patterns of within-brood sex ratio (e.g.
   in relation to laying order). Failure to take sex-specific sibling
   interactions into account could partly explain the lack of sex ratio
   adjustment in accordance with theoretical expectations in vertebrates,
   and differences among taxa in sex-specific sibling interactions generate
   predictions for comparative and experimental studies.}},

   split-litter design in mice, we found that overall maternal provisioning
   and offspring weight gain are significantly correlated but are affected
   by a different set of parameters, except for the effect of maternal
   bodyweight. While the level of maternal provisioning was influenced by
   both offspring and foster mother genotype, offspring weight gain was
   only affected by the number of males in the mixed litter. We suggest

Abstract = {{Mothers may profoundly affect offspring phenotype and performance by
   adjusting egg components, including steroid hormones. We studied the
   effects of elevated prenatal testosterone (T) exposure in the
   ring-necked pheasant on the expression of a suite of male and female
   traits, including perinatal response to stress, immune response, growth,
   and secondary sexual traits. Prenatal T levels were increased by
   injecting the yolk of unincubated eggs with physiological doses of the
   hormone. Yolk T injection resulted in a reduced length of male tarsal
   spurs, a trait which positively predicts male success in intra- and
   intersexual selection and viability, whereas no direct effect on male
   wattle characteristics or plumage traits of either sex was observed.
   Female spur length was also negatively affected by T, but to a lesser
   extent than in males. In addition, the covariation between male
   secondary sexual traits, which are reliable quality indicators, differed
   between T and control males, suggesting that the manipulation may have
   altered the assessment of overall male quality by other males and
   females. In conclusion, the negative effects of elevated yolk T on spur
   length, a trait which positively predicts male fitness, coupled with the
   lack of effects on growth or other traits in both sexes, provided
   limited evidence for mothers being subjected to a trade-off between
   positive and negative consequences of yolk T deposition on offspring
   traits and suggest that directional selection for reduced yolk T levels
   may occur in the ring-necked pheasant.}},

Abstract = {{Evolution of size and growth depends on heritable variation arising from
   additive and maternal genetic effects. Levels of heritable (and
   nonheritable) variation might change over ontogeny, increasing through
   ``variance compounding{''} or decreasing through ``compensatory
   growth.{''} We test for these processes using a meta-analysis of
   age-specific weight traits in domestic ungulates. Generally, mean
   standardized variance components decrease with age, consistent with
   compensatory growth. Phenotypic convergence among adult sheep occurs
   through decreasing environmental and maternal genetic variation.
   Maternal variation similarly declines in cattle. Maternal genetic
   effects are thus reduced with age (both in absolute and relative terms).
   Significant trends in heritability (decreasing in cattle, increasing in
   sheep) result from declining maternal and environmental components
   rather than from changing additive variation. There was no evidence for
   increasing standardized variance components. Any compounding must
   therefore be masked by more important compensatory processes. While
   extrapolation of these patterns to processes in natural population is
   difficult, our results highlight the inadequacy of assuming constancy in
   genetic parameters over ontogeny. Negative covariance between direct and
   maternal genetic effects was common. Negative correlations with additive
   and maternal genetic variances indicate that antagonistic pleiotropy
   (between additive and maternal genetic effects) may maintain genetic
   variance and limit responses to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Australian brush-turkeys (Alectura lathami) hatch in incubation mounds
   of organic material and have no parental role models to learn from. When
   raised in outdoor aviaries, without adults, four of six males built
   incubation mounds at an early age of 4.5-9 months. The two males without
   mounds were the only ones without detectable levels of testosterone (T)
   at 4.5 months, whereas body mass did not explain the presence or absence
   of mound building. At the age of 11 months, all males had detectable T,
   including those without mounds. This study also investigated the
   development of social dominance in males kept in mixed-sex groups for
   4.5 months. At this latter age, higher-ranked males tended to have
   higher T levels (P = 0.076), whereas dominance ranks at 4.5 months were
   not correlated with body mass or size, either at this age or at
   hatching. Overall, these results suggest that mound building develops
   without learning, and there is a relationship between T levels and
   dominance status as well as the absence or presence of mound building.
   These findings contribute to discussions on the role of learning in
   behavioural development and the role of T and body mass in avian life
   history.}},

Abstract = {{Androgen hormones of maternal origin contained in the eggs of avian
   species are considered to have positive effects on offspring
   characteristics and performance. However, negative consequences have
   also been reported, suggesting that mothers may experience a trade-off
   between beneficial and detrimental effects of egg androgens to offspring
   fitness. We studied the effects of elevated yolk testosterone (T)
   concentration on survival, development and phenotype of male and female
   yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) chicks by injecting egg yolks
   with physiological doses of the hormone. Elevated yolk T resulted in a
   male-biased post-hatching sex ratio, T-treated clutches producing a
   greater proportion of males compared to control ones at day 4
   post-hatching, likely resulting from a reduction of female embryonic
   survival, whereas no effect of hormone treatment on hatching success or
   short-term chick survival was observed. In addition, T depressed
   post-hatching body mass in both sexes but had no effects on the
   intensity of the cell-mediated immune response or skeletal growth. No
   sex differences in egg characteristics or chick phenotype were detected.
   Time to hatching was not affected by T, but females originating from
   first laid eggs hatched earlier than males of the same laying order,
   independently of hormone treatment. However, the implications of sex
   differences in hatching times are unclear in the study species. Taken
   together, our results suggest that female yellow-legged gulls may be
   constrained in transferring androgens to their eggs by negative
   consequences on the viability of female offspring and growth of chicks
   of the two sexes.}},

Abstract = {{The induction of diapause can be adaptive for egg survival during
   unfavorable conditions, while direct development can be advantageous
   under favorable conditions by allowing additional generations to exploit
   abundant resources. Therefore, the physiological capability of a female
   to respond to environmental cues indicative of habitat quality by
   producing eggs of the appropriate developmental phenotype should be
   under strong selection. Additionally, developing embryos may alter the
   developmental trajectory initiated by the female in response to changing
   environmental conditions. In this study, we used a cross-fostering
   approach to isolate the maternal effects of parental diapause history
   (not previously studied) and egg-laying temperature from the influence
   of the incubation environment experienced by the developing embryo on
   the proportion of diapause eggs produced by the striped ground cricket,
   Allonemobius socius. We found that an interaction between egg-incubation
   temperature and parental diapause history strongly affected the
   proportion of diapause eggs produced and the proportion of eggs that
   hatched within a 16-18 day incubation period, while egg-laying
   temperature and all other interactions did not. These novel results
   indicate that embryos can respond directly to the environmental
   conditions they experience during development, but that their ability to
   do so is influenced by maternal effects such as parental diapause
   history. The results of this study not only provide evidence, for the
   first time, of parental diapause history affecting diapause proportions,
   but also raise additional questions about the mechanism by which
   environmental information is transmitted from parent to offspring and
   how offspring are able to respond to conditions experienced during their
   own development.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies on hormone-mediated maternal effects in birds have
   highlighted the influence of variable maternal yolk androgen
   concentration on offspring phenotype, particularly in terms of early
   development. If genetic differences between laying females regulate

   maternal effect is an indirect genetic effect which can provide a basis
   for the co-evolution of maternal and offspring phenotypes. Thus, we
   investigated the evolutionary associations between maternally derived

   via a comparative, phylogenetic analysis. Our results from
   species-correlation and independent contrasts analyses provide
   convergent evidence for the correlated evolution of maternal yolk T
   concentration and length of the prenatal developmental period in
   passerines. Here, we show these traits are significantly negatively
   associated (species-correlation: p<0.001, r(2) = 0.85; independent

Abstract = {{Natural populations vary tremendously in their susceptibility to
   infectious disease agents. The factors (environmental or genetic) that
   underlie this variation determine the impact of disease on host
   population dynamics and evolution, and affect our capacity to contain
   disease outbreaks and to enhance resistance in agricultural animals and
   disease vectors. Here, we show that changes in the environmental
   conditions under which female Daphnia magna are kept can more than halve
   the susceptibility of their offspring to bacterial infection.
   Counter-intuitively, and unlike the effects typically observed in
   vertebrates for transfer of immunity, mothers producing offspring under
   poor conditions produced more resistant offspring than did mothers
   producing offspring in favourable conditions. This effect occurred when
   mothers who were well provisioned during their own development then
   found themselves reproducing in poor conditions. These effects likely
   reflect adaptive optimal resource allocation where better quality
   offspring ate produced in poor environments to enhance survival.
   Maternal exposure to parasites also reduced offspring susceptibility,
   depending on host genotype and offspring food levels. These maternal
   responses to environmental conditions mean that studies focused on a
   single generation, and those in which environmental variation is
   experimentally minimized, may fail to describe the crucial parameters
   that influence the spread of disease. The large maternal effects we
   report here will, if they are widespread in nature, affect disease
   dynamics, the level of genetic polymorphism in populations, and likely
   weaken the evolutionary response to parasite-mediated selection.}},

Abstract = {{Body size is an important determinant of fitness in many organisms.
   While size will typically change over the lifetime of an individual,
   heritable components of phenotypic variance may also show ontogenetic
   variation. We estimated genetic ( additive and maternal) and
   environmental covariance structures for a size trait ( June weight)
   measured over the first 5 years of life in a natural population of
   bighorn sheep Ovis canadensis. We also assessed the utility of random
   regression models for estimating these structures. Additive genetic
   variance was found for June weight, with heritability increasing over
   ontogeny because of declining environmental variance. This pattern,
   mirrored at the phenotypic level, likely reflects viability selection
   acting on early size traits. Maternal genetic effects were significant
   at ages 0 and 1, having important evolutionary implications for early
   weight, but declined with age being negligible by age 2. Strong positive
   genetic correlations between age-specific traits suggest that selection
   on June weight at any age will likely induce positively correlated
   responses across ontogeny. Random regression modeling yielded similar
   results to traditional methods. However, by facilitating more efficient
   data use where phenotypic sampling is incomplete, random regression
   should allow better estimation of genetic (co)variances for size and
   growth traits in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of parent-offspring interactions for the provisioning of
   care is usually explained as the phenotypic outcome of resolved
   conflicting selection pressures. However, parental care and offspring
   solicitation are expected to have complex patterns of inheritance. Here
   we present a quantitative genetic model of parent-offspring interactions
   that allows us to investigate the evolutionary maintenance of a state of
   resolved conflict. We show that offspring solicitation and parental
   provisioning are expected to become genetically correlated through
   coadaptation and that their genetic architecture is dictated by an
   interaction between patterns of selection and the proximate mechanisms
   regulating supply and demand. When selection is predominately on
   offspring solicitation, our model suggests that the genetic correlations
   between provisioning and solicitation are usually positive if
   provisioning reduces solicitation. Conversely, when selection is
   predominately on parental provisioning, the correlations are mostly
   negative as long as parents show a positive response to offspring
   demand. Empirical estimates of the genetic architecture of traits
   involved in family interactions fit these predictions. Our model
   demonstrates how the evolutionary maintenance of parent-offspring
   interactions can result in variable patterns of coadaptation, and it
   provides an explanation for the diversity of family interactions within

Abstract = {{Adaptive evolution is often strongly influenced by maternal inheritance
   that transfers the parental strategies across generations. The
   consequences of maternal effects for the offspring generation depend on
   the between-generation similarity in environments and on the evolved
   sensitivity of the offspring's ontogeny to maternal effects. When these
   factors differ between sons and daughters, maternal effects can
   influence the evolution of sexual dimorphism. The establishment of house
   finch populations across western Montana during the last 30 years was
   accompanied by rapid evolutionary change in sexual size dimorphism. Here
   I show that traits that changed the most across generations were most
   influenced by maternal effects in males but not females. Maternal
   effects differentially affected sons' and daughters' survival; greater
   maternal effects were commonly associated with higher survival of sons,
   especially when maternal and offspring environments were similar.
   Stronger maternal effects extended preselection phenotypic variance in
   morphological traits of males, thereby producing some locally adaptive
   phenotypes and lessening juvenile mortality. Thus, the observed
   sex-specific maternal effects and their contribution to the evolution of
   sexual size dimorphism are likely a passive consequence of the distinct
   sensitivity of sons and daughters to maternal adaptations to breeding in
   ecologically distinct parts of the house finch's expanding range.}},

Abstract = {{The need for evolutionary studies on quantitative traits that integrate
   genetics is increasing. Studies on consistent individual differences in
   behavioural traits provide a good opportunity to do controlled
   experiments on the genetic mechanisms underlying the variation and
   covariation in complex behavioural traits. In this review we will
   highlight the contribution of genetic studies in animal personality
   research. We will start with reviewing the evidence that shows how much
   variation in animal personality traits is genetic, and connect this to
   knowledge from human personality studies. We will continue by
   considering the nature of that variation, its generation and
   maintenance. Finally we will point to further possibilities for studying
   the genetics of animal personalities. We will underline the importance
   of integrating both proximate and ultimate approaches when studying the
   evolution of animal personalities.}},

Abstract = {{Three main hypotheses, have been invoked to explain divergent genital
   evolution, the lock and key, pleiotropy, and sexual selection
   hypotheses, each of which make different predictions about how genital
   traits are inherited. Here we used a half-sib breeding design to examine
   the patterns of genetic variation and covariation between male genital
   sclerites, and their covariance with general body morphology in the dung
   beetle Onthophagus taurus. We found CVA's and CVP's were similar for
   both genital and general morphological traits and that CVR's were large
   for both trait types. We found that male genital sclerites were
   negatively genetically correlated with general morphological traits.
   Variation in male genital morphology has direct implications for a
   male's fertilization success and the resulting sexual selection acting
   on male genitalia is predicted to maintain high levels of additive
   genetic variance. Contrary to this prediction, we found that individual
   genital sclerites all had low levels of additive genetic variance and
   large maternal and environmental sources of variation. Our data suggest
   that the genital sclerites in O. taurus are not inherited independently
   but as a genetically integrated unit. More importantly, the way the
   different sclerites function to influence male fertilization success
   reflects this genetic integration. Even though levels of V-A in
   individual genital sclerites may be low, there may still be sufficient
   V-A in multivariate trait space for selection to generate evolutionary
   change in the overall morphology of male genitalia.}},

Title = {{Speciation and gene flow between snails of opposite chirality}},
Journal = {{PLOS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Left-right asymmetry in snails is intriguing because individuals of
   opposite chirality are either unable to mate or can only mate with
   difficulty, so could be reproductively isolated from each other. We have
   therefore investigated chiral evolution in the Japanese land snail genus
   Euhadra to understand whether changes in chirality have promoted
   speciation. In particular, we aimed to understand the effect of the
   maternal inheritance of chirality on reproductive isolation and gene
   flow. We found that the mitochondrial DNA phylogeny of Euhadra is
   consistent with a single, relatively ancient evolution of sinistral
   species and suggests either recent ``single-gene speciation'' or gene
   flow between chiral morphs that are unable to mate. To clarify the
   conditions under which new chiral morphs might evolve and whether
   single-gene speciation can occur, we developed a mathematical model that
   is relevant to any maternal-effect gene. The model shows that
   reproductive character displacement can promote the evolution of new
   chiral morphs, tending to counteract the positive frequency-dependent
   selection that would otherwise drive the more common chiral morph to
   fixation. This therefore suggests a general mechanism as to how chiral
   variation arises in snails. In populations that contain both chiral
   morphs, two different situations are then possible. In the first, gene
   flow is substantial between morphs even without interchiral mating,
   because of the maternal inheritance of chirality. In the second,
   reproductive isolation is possible but unstable, and will also lead to
   gene flow if intrachiral matings occasionally produce offspring with the
   opposite chirality. Together, the results imply that speciation by
   chiral reversal is only meaningful in the context of a complex
   biogeographical process, and so must usually involve other factors. In
   order to understand the roles of reproductive character displacement and
   gene flow in the chiral evolution of Euhadra, it will be necessary to
   investigate populations in which both chiral morphs coexist.}},

Journal = {{QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{80}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We discuss the evolutionary origin and elaboration of sociality using an
   indirect genetic effects perspective. Indirect genetic effects models
   simultaneously consider zygotic genes, genes expressed in social
   partners (especially mothers and siblings), and the interactions between
   them. Incorporation of these diverse genetic effects should lead to more
   realistic models of social evolution. We first review haplodiploidy as a
   factor that promotes the evolution of eusociality. Social insect
   biologists have doubted the importance of relatedness asymmetry caused
   by hoplodiploidy and focused on other predisposing factors such as
   maternal care. However, indirect effects theory shows that maternal care
   evolves more readily in haplodiploids, especially with inbreeding and
   despite multiple mating. Because extended maternal care is believed to
   be a precondition for the evolution of eusociality, the evolutionary
   bias towards maternal care in haplodiploids may result in a further bias
   towards eusocialily in these groups. Next, we compare kin selection and
   parental manipulation and then briefly review additional hypotheses for
   the evolutionary origin of eusociality. We present a verbal model for
   the evolutionary origin and elaboration of sib-social care from maternal
   care based on the modification of the timing of expression of maternal
   care behaviors. Specifically, heterochrony genes cause maternal care
   behaviors to be expressed prereproductively towards siblings instead of
   postreproductively towards offspring. Our review demonstrates that both
   maternal effect genes (expressed in a parental manipulation manner) and
   direct effect zygotic genes (expressed in an offspring control manner)
   are likely involved in the evolution of eusociality. We conclude by
   describing theoretical and empirical advances with indirect genetic
   effects and sociogenomics, and me provide specific quantitative genetic
   and genomic predictions from our heterochrony model for the evolutionary
   origin and elaboration of eusociality.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects on offspring phenotypes occur because mothers in many

   these factors are correctly ``environmental{''} with respect to the

   environmental basis in the maternal generation. Here, reciprocal crosses
   between C57BL/6J and 10 LGXSM recombinant inbred ( RI) strains were
   performed, and litters were divided at weaning into high-fat and low-fat
   dietary treatments. Differences between reciprocal litters were used to
   measure genetic maternal effects on offspring phenotypes. Nearly all
   traits, including weekly body weights and adult blood serum traits, show
   effects indicative of genetic variation in maternal effects across RI
   strains, allowing the quantitative trait loci involved to be mapped.
   Although much of the literature on maternal effects relates to early
   life traits, we detect strong and significant maternal effects on traits
   measured at adulthood ( as much as 10\% of the trait variance at 17 or
   more weeks after weaning). We also found an interaction affecting adult
   phenotype between the effects of maternal care between RI strain mothers
   and C57BL/6J mothers and a later environmental factor ( dietary fat

Abstract = {{Little is known about maternal effects on post-weaning development, yet
   they may be important because maternal care could have long-term
   consequences only evident when offspring approach adulthood. We have
   assessed the effects of maternal age, current reproduction ( presence of
   a kid of the year) and social rank on the body mass, horn length and
   social rank of 1-and 2-year-old mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus).
   Maternal reproductive status and social rank did not affect the mass or
   horn length of either yearlings or 2-year-olds. Maternal age was
   positively correlated with yearling body mass for males but not females.
   We could not detect any maternal age effects on body mass of
   2-year-olds. Maternal age and spring forage quality were positively
   correlated with horn length of yearlings of both sexes, but not of
   2-year-olds. Juvenile females showed compensatory growth in mass between
   1 and 2 years of age, but males did not. Neither sex showed compensatory
   growth in horn length. None of the maternal characteristics we examined
   directly affected the social rank of juveniles, which increased with
   body mass. Social rank in female mountain goats seems to be established
   early in life and maintained to adulthood. By affecting yearling
   development, maternal age could affect the reproductive success of

Abstract = {{Using a set of nine effectively isogenic lines collected from nature in
   1998, we observed unperturbed behaviors of mixed-sex groups of
   Drosophila melanogaster. We repeatedly scanned replicated groups of
   genetically identical individuals, five females and five males, and
   recorded the behavior of each individual (i.e., walking, feeding,
   grooming, flying, courting, mating, fighting, or resting). From these
   behaviors, we made a composite variable of activity for-our quantitative
   genetic analysis. Genotypes differed in activity, explaining 14.41\% of
   the variation in activity; 8.60\% of the variation was explained by a
   significant genotype X sex interaction, which signifies genetic
   variation for sexual dimorphism in behavior. Phenotypic plasticity
   explained 11.13\% of the variation in activity. Different genotypes and
   sexes within genotypes had different rank orders of the component
   behaviors that contribute to activity. We found no effect of common
   rearing environment. Instead, differences between replicate groups
   within genotype accounted for 19.47\% variation in activity, and
   activity was significantly repeatable across scans. This emergent group
   behavior is likely caused by differences between groups of interacting
   individuals, even though individuals were genetically identical across
   groups. Thus, emergent group behavior explained almost as much variation
   in activity as the combined sources of genetic variation (23.01\%), and
   this is an additional level on which selection could operate:
   individuals and groups. We discuss how differences among groups could
   change patterns of additive genetic variation available for evolution.
   Furthermore, because the behavior of an individual is influenced by
   conspecifics, genotype interactions between individuals could contribute
   to indirect selection. Finally, if we consider activity as a syndrome
   governing all component behaviors with strong genetic correlations among
   behaviors within an individual, then these component behaviors cannot
   evolve independently. These results suggest that reductionist approaches
   of molecular behavior genetics may be incomplete and/or misleading when
   considering similar phenotypes at the population level or when trying to
   understand how behaviors evolve.}},

Abstract = {{Females typically mate with more than one male despite the costs
   incurred, thus questioning Bateman's principle. A series of genetic
   benefits have been proposed to account for the evolution of polyandry,
   including the acquisition of viability genes for offspring. The
   `intrinsic male quality' hypothesis suggests that polyandry increases
   the probability that females produce offspring sired by males that
   bestow high viability on their offspring. Heritable variation in
   viability is the basic requirement for the occurrence of this genetic
   benefit. By using a half-sib breeding design with a species of cricket
   in which polyandry is known to increase hatching success, we present
   clear experimental evidence that intrinsic male quality contributes to
   embryo viability. Despite recent support for the evolution of polyandry
   based on compatibility of genotypes between males and females, we show
   that hatching success is not determined by an interaction between
   paternal and maternal genotypes but rather that sons inherit paternal
   genes that influence the viability of eggs laid by their mates.
   Moreover, our data implicate a potential role for indirect genetic
   effects of male accessory gland products on embryo viability. Additive
   genetic contributions to embryo viability may be an important factor
   underlying the frequently observed benefits of polyandrous behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the relationships among phenotypic plasticity, parental
   effects, and parental care in plants by presenting data from four
   experiments examining reflectance/color patterns in Plantago lanceolata.
   In three experiments, we measured spike (inflorescence) reflectance
   between 362 and 850 nm using a spectrophotometer with an integrating
   sphere. Experiments show that (1) spike reflectance changes seasonally
   within and outside the visible portion of the spectrum of radiant
   energy, (2) increasing ambient temperature causes an individual plant to
   produce flowering and fruiting spikes that reflect more/lighten in color
   (the greatest changes occur in the regions around 550 nm and between 750
   and 850 nm, the visible and near-infrared regions, respectively), (3)
   responses are reversible, (4) genotypes within populations and
   populations from different latitudes differ in mean reflectance and
   degree of phenotypic plasticity. In a fourth experiment, we measured
   internal spike temperature. Darker spikes, those produced at lower
   temperature, got hotter than did lighter spikes in full sun. Thus,
   plants can partially thermoregulate reproduction and the embryonic
   development of their offspring. In light of a previous experiment, data
   suggest that thermoregulation produces adaptive parental effects and is
   a mechanism by which A lanceolata provides parental care.}},

Abstract = {{Male genitalia may experience more rapid, divergent evolution than any
   other animal character, but why? Research during the past several
   decades has culminated in the view that genital diversification
   primarily results from postmating sexual selection (e.g., sperm
   competition or cryptic female choice). However, the potential roles of
   premating sexual selection (e.g., mate choice) and natural selection
   have received little attention. We examined the possible importance of
   these mechanisms by investigating divergence in male genitalia among
   populations differing in predator regime for two species of live-bearing
   fish (Gambusia affinis in Texas and Gambusia hubbsi in The Bahamas).
   When controlled for body size, males exhibited a larger gonopodium
   (sperm-transfer organ) in predator-free environments than in predatory
   environments, a trend that persisted across space (multiple
   populations), time (multiple years), and species. By conducting
   laboratory experiments with G. affinis, we found that premating sexual
   selection seems to favor larger male genitalia (females exhibited mating
   preference for males having larger gonopodia), but natural selection in
   the presence of predatory fishes seems to favor reduced genital size
   (larger gonopodium size was associated with reduced burst-swimming
   performance, an important antipredator behavior). Although postmating
   sexual selection is widely presumed to be the most important mechanism
   driving genital diversification, these findings suggest that alternative
   mechanisms, particularly for organisms that cannot retract their
   genitalia, may also prove important.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: The proper development of any organ or tissue requires the
   coordinated expression of its underlying genes that can be located on
   different genomes present in an organism. For instance, each step in the
   development of seed for a higher plant is the consequence of gene
   interactions from the maternal, embryo and endosperm genomes.
   Results: We present a multivariate statistical model for mapping
   quantitative trait loci (QTL) by incorporating two important aspects of
   seed development in plants-QTL interactions derived from different
   genomes, the maternal, embryo and endosperm, and genetic correlations
   among phenotypic traits expressed in different genome-specific tissues.
   This model, which has a high dimensionality, is constructed within the
   maximum-likelihood context based on a finite mixture model. The
   implementation of the expectation-maximization algorithm allows for the
   efficient estimation of QTL positions, their action and interaction
   effects and pleiotropic effects. The application of this
   high-dimensional model to a real rice dataset has validated its
   usefulness.
   Conclusions: Our model was derived for self-pollinated plants, but it
   can be extended to cross-pollinated plants and to animals. With the
   burgeoning of genetic and genomic data, this high-dimensional model will
   have many implications for agricultural and evolutionary genetic
   research.}},

Abstract = {{During sexual encounters, individuals often use signals, such as display
   traits, to attract mates. if individuals alter their display traits with
   respect to the genotype of potential mates, indirect genetic effects
   (IGEs) may occur in which the genes of one individual influence the
   phenotype of another. Although IGEs between related individuals have
   received much attention, their occurrence between unrelated individuals
   during sexual encounters has not. Here, we demonstrate that in the
   Australian fruit fly Drosophila serrata, males assess females by using
   both visual and olfactory cues, resulting in a rapid plastic response
   (within minutes) in male cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), a display trait
   that is an important target of mate choice. Several CHCs in males
   exhibited significant IGEs, and IGEs were inducible on both males reared
   in the laboratory and on field-caught individuals. A vector describing
   genetic variance in multiple CHCs in females was found to be almost
   identical to a vector describing indirect genetic variance in male CHCs,
   suggesting that males might assess female CHCs during courtship. This
   vector displayed contributions from all female CHCs in the same
   direction and of similar magnitude, suggesting that female condition may
   be the underlying casual trait that males are assessing. Consistent with
   this interpretation, when measured directly in a separate experiment,
   genetic variance in female condition accounted for 19.8\% of the
   indirect genetic variance in male CHCs. These indirect genetic effects
   have the potential to alter the response to selection of male sexual
   display traits.}},

Abstract = {{Germination responses to seasonal conditions determine the environment
   experienced by postgermination life stages, and this ability has
   potential consequences for the evolution of plant life histories. Using
   recombinant inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana, we tested whether
   life-history characters exhibited plasticity to germination timing,
   whether germination timing influenced the strength and mode of natural
   selection on life-history traits, and whether germination timing
   influenced the expression of genetic variation for life-history traits.
   Adult life-history traits exhibited strong plasticity to season of
   germination, and season of germination significantly altered the
   strength, mode, and even direction of selection on life-history traits
   under some conditions. None of the average plastic responses to season
   of germination or season of dispersal were adaptive, although some
   genotypes within our sample did exhibit adaptive responses. Thus,
   recombination between inbred lineages created some novel adaptive
   genotypes with improved responses to the seasonal timing of germination
   under some, but not all, conditions. Genetically based variation in
   germination time tended to augment genetic variances of adult
   life-history traits, but it did not increase the heritabilities because
   it also increased environmentally induced variance. Under some
   conditions, plasticity of life-history traits in response to genetically
   variable germination timing actually obscured genetic variation for
   those traits. Therefore, the evolution of germination responses can
   influence the evolution of life histories in a general manner by
   altering natural selection on life-history traits and the genetic
   variation of these traits.}},

Abstract = {{In outcrossing plants, seed dispersal distance is often less than pollen
   movement. If the scale of environmental heterogeneity within a
   population is greater than typical seed dispersal distances but less
   than pollen movement, an individual's environment will be similar to
   that of its mother but not necessarily its father. Under these
   conditions, environmental maternal effects may evolve as a source of
   adaptive plasticity between generations, enhancing offspring fitness in
   the environment that they are likely to experience. This idea is
   illustrated using Campanula americana, an herb that grows in understory
   and light-gap habitats. Estimates of seed dispersal suggest that
   offspring typically experience the same light environment as their
   mother. In a field experiment testing the effect of open vs understory
   maternal light environments, maternal light directly influenced
   offspring germination rate and season, and indirectly affected
   germination season by altering maternal flowering time. Results to date
   indicate that these maternal effects are adaptive; further experimental
   tests are ongoing. Evaluating maternal environmental effects in an
   ecological context demonstrates that they may provide phenotypic
   adaptation to local environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Sperm design and function are important determinants of male
   reproductive success and are expected to be under strong selection(1,2).
   The way that spermatozoa phenotypes evolve is poorly understood, because
   there have been few studies of the quantitative genetics of sperm(3-5).
   Here we show, in the zebra finch Taeniopygia guttata, an extraordinary
   degree of inter-male variation in sperm design that is independent of
   sperm swimming velocity. A quantitative genetics study using data from
   over 900 zebra finches in a complex breeding experiment showed that
   sperm head, mid-piece and flagellum length are heritable, that negative
   genetic correlations exist between sperm traits, and that significant
   indirect ( maternal) genetic effects exist. Selection on the zebra finch
   sperm phenotype may be low because sperm competition is infrequent in
   this species(6), and this, in combination with negative genetic
   correlations and maternal genetic effects, may account for the variation
   in sperm phenotype between males. These results have important
   implications for the evolution of sperm in other taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Heritable maternal effects have important consequences for the
   evolutionary dynamics of phenotypic traits under selection, but have
   only rarely been tested for or quantified in evolutionary studies. Here
   we estimate maternal effects on early-life traits in a feral population
   of Soay sheep (Ovis aries) from St Kilda, Scotland. We then partition
   the maternal effects into genetic and environmental components to obtain
   the first direct estimates of maternal genetic effects in a free-living
   population, and furthermore test for covariance between direct and
   maternal genetic effects. Using an animal model approach, direct
   heritabilities (h(2)) were low but maternal genetic effects (m(2))
   represented a relatively large proportion of the total phenotypic
   variance for each trait (birth weight m(2) = 0.119, birth date m(2) =
   0.197, natal litter size m(2) = 0.211). A negative correlation between
   direct and maternal genetic effects was estimated for each trait, but
   was only statistically significant for natal litter size (r(am) =
   -0.714). Total heritabilities (incorporating variance from heritable
   maternal effects and the direct-maternal genetic covariance) were
   significant for birth weight and birth date but not for natal litter
   size. Inadequately specified models greatly overestimated additive
   genetic variance and hence direct h(2) (by a factor of up to 6.45 in the
   case of birth date). We conclude that failure to model heritable
   maternal variance can result in over- or under-estimation of the
   potential for traits to respond to selection, and advocate an increased
   effort to explicitly measure maternal genetic effects in evolutionary
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal influence on offspring goes beyond strict nuclear (DNA)
   inheritance: inherited maternal mRNA, mitochondria, caring and nurturing
   are all additional sources that affect offspring development, and they
   can be also shaped by evolution. These additional factors are called
   maternal effects, and their important role in evolution is well
   established experimentally. This paper presents two models for maternal
   effects, based on a genetic algorithm and simulated development of
   neural networks. We extended a model by Eggenberger by adding two
   mechanisms for maternal effects: the first mechanism attempts to
   replicate maternal cytoplasmic control, while the second mechanism
   replicates interactions between the fetus and the uterine environment.
   For examining the role of maternal effects in artificial evolution, we
   evolved networks for the odd-3-parity problem, using increasing rates of
   maternal influence. Experiments have shown that maternal effects
   increase adaptiveness in the latter model.}},

Abstract = {{Niche construction is the process whereby organisms, through their
   metabolism, activities, and choices, modify their own and/or each

   evolution and niche construction by focusing on non-linear interactions
   between genetic and environmental factors shared by interacting species.
   We constructed a new fitness landscape model termed the NKES model by
   introducing the environmental factors and their interactions with the
   genetic factors into Kauffman's NKCS model. The evolutionary experiments
   were conducted using hill-climbing and niche-constructing processes on
   this landscape. Results have shown that the average fitness among
   species strongly depends on the ruggedness of the fitness landscape (K)
   and the degree of the effect of niche construction on genetic factors
   (E). Especially, we observed two different roles of niche construction:
   moderate perturbations on hill-climbing processes on the rugged
   landscapes, and the strong constraint which yields the convergence to a
   stable state.}},

Abstract = {{Animals have the ability to alter development, physiology, growth, and
   behavior in response to different environmental conditions. These
   responses represent critical assessments of both external and internal
   factors. For example, the timing of metamorphosis, hatching, or birth
   depends on the trade-offs between growth opportunity and mortality risk
   in the developmental habitat. Physiological sensors compute these
   trade-offs as a function of energy balance and environmental stress, and
   effectors initiate physiological, developmental, and behavioral
   responses to these determinations. The neuroendocrine stress axis
   provides a means for animals to integrate information from multiple
   sources and to respond accordingly. Considerable evidence now supports
   the view that the secretion of hormones critical to development
   (corticosteroid and thyroid hormones) is controlled by a common
   neuroendocrine stress pathway involving corticotropin-releasing factor
   (CRF) and related peptides. CRF produced in the hypothalamus stimulates
   the biosynthesis and secretion of both thyroid and corticosteroid
   hormones, leading to accelerated tadpole metamorphosis. Similarly, in
   mammals CRF of fetal and placental origin has been shown to influence
   the timing of birth. Studies in several experimental animal models and
   in humans show that early life experience can have long-term phenotypic
   consequences. Furthermore, there is evidence that phenotypic expression
   is strongly influenced by the actions of stress hormones produced during
   development. The integrated neuroendocrine response to stress, and its
   role in timing critical life history transitions and establishing
   long-term phenotypic expression, arose early in the evolution of
   vertebrates. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{When ontogeny takes place in a family, and parents provide essential
   resources for development, the parents become an environmental component
   to the development of a wide range of offspring traits. Because
   differences among parents may partly reflect genetic variation, this
   environmental component contains genes and may itself evolve. Also, when
   offspring play an active role in family interactions, offspring become a
   social environmental component to parents, affecting their behavior in
   turn, which potentially results in reciprocal social selection. Thus, an
   evolutionary process of coadaptation to family life, additionally driven
   by conflicts of interests, may have shaped the expression and
   development patterns underlying infant behaviors. The complex genetics
   arising from family interactions can be formalized by extending standard
   quantitative genetic models. These models demonstrate how the explicit
   consideration of the family environment can profoundly alter both the
   expression and evolutionary response to selection of behaviors involved
   in family interactions. Behavioral genetic studies have begun to unravel
   the complex genetics underlying infant solicitation behaviors and
   parental provisioning, although many focus on one side of the
   interaction. A genetic analysis incorporating interactions among family
   members explicitly may be critical because the genes underlying the
   expression of parental provisioning indirectly affect offspring
   behaviors, and vice versa.}},

Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{196-200}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In many species males that tend to win fights against other males are
   more attractive to females. There are three ways in which male fighting
   ability and attractiveness may be associated: (1) attractiveness and
   fighting ability are influenced by the same underlying traits (e.g.,
   body size), (2) females prefer males that have directly observed winning
   fights, or (3) winning previous fights indirectly improves a male's
   chance of being preferred by females. The last possibility may arise as
   a consequence of the ``loser effect{''}; in many species when a male
   loses a fight his probability of losing subsequent fights increases.
   There are, however, no studies testing whether such a ``loser effect{''}
   also influences male attractiveness. Here we show that male
   attractiveness and fighting ability are positively correlated in the
   house cricket, Acheta domesticus. Our experiment was designed so that
   females could not directly observe the outcome of fights, thus
   eliminating possibility (2) above. We then tested between possibilities
   (1) and (3) by making use of the fact that in some cricket species the
   ``loser effect{''} can be eliminated experimentally by `shaking' a male
   and stimulating the motor program for flying. We showed that in A.
   domesticus `shaking' does affect the outcome of subsequent fights. Males
   that had won two previous fights were less likely to win a fight after
   being `shaken' than when subject to a control treatment. In contrast,
   males that had lost two previous fights were more likely to win a fight
   after being `shaken' than when they were not shaken. There was, however,
   no effect of `shaking' on male attractiveness. We conclude that the
   ``loser effect{''} does not alter the tendency for large, dominant males
   to be attractive to females. Instead, it appears that there are traits
   correlated with both fighting ability and attractiveness. One such trait
   is body size. Fight winners were significantly larger than losers and
   attractiveness was positively correlated with male body size.}},

Abstract = {{Age is known to have a large effect upon fertility and survival. Here we
   study the impact of maternal and grandmaternal age on wing size and
   developmental instability (DI) in offspring using a parthenogenetic
   strain of Drosophila mercatorum. This enabled us to cancel out any
   genetic variance between individuals. The mean centroid size of the
   wings was estimated in offspring from four maternal/grandmaternal age
   groups. Further, DI was calculated by measuring phenotypic variability
   and correcting this index for the bias produced by the environmental
   variability. The offspring developed from eggs laid by mothers belonging
   to four different age groups with young (Y) or old (O) mothers and
   grandmothers. The age groups are: YY, YO, OY and OO, with the first
   letter referring to the age of the grandmother and the second letter to
   the age of the mother. We consider flies between three to six days of
   age as young and flies between 15 and 18 days of age as old. We found
   that environmental variability was present in this study and therefore
   the correction for its bias on phenotypic variability was shown to be
   necessary for a correct interpretation of the results. DI displayed, for
   most of the traits investigated, a significantly higher level in the OY
   and OO age groups, as compared to the YY and YO age groups. The mean
   centroid size of the wings were in almost all cases significantly
   different among the age groups with the highest mean value in the OY
   group for all traits. This investigation shows that offspring are
   affected by maternal age and that this effect can be transmitted
   maternally across more than one generation.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter summarizes several experimental approaches used to identify
   the effects of dominance, epistasis, and genotype-by-environment
   interactions in the genetic architecture of the mating behavior of the
   common house fly (Musca domestica L.). Quantitative genetic
   investigations of mating behavior hold special intrigue for unraveling
   the complexities of fitness traits, with applications to theory on
   sexual selection and speciation. Besides being well suited to
   large-scale quantitative genetic protocols, the house fly has a
   remarkably complex courtship repertoire, affording special opportunities
   for studies on communication, social interactions, and learning.
   Increased additive genetic variances for the courtship repertoire of
   experimentally bottlenecked populations provided evidence for the
   presence of dominance and/or epistasis. Negative genetic variances in
   these populations suggested genotype-by-environment interactions, where
   the environment is the mating partner. Line cross assays of populations
   that had been subjected to selection for divergent courtship repertoire
   confirmed that both dominance and epistasis have significant effects.
   These crosses also showed more directly that the expression of the
   male's genotype is dependent upon the preferences of his mating partner.
   Repeatability studies also detailed how males alter their courtship
   performances with successive encounters within and across females, such
   that the males learn to improve their techniques in securing
   copulations. A review of 41 animal behavior studies found that a wide
   range of traits and taxa have dominance, epistasis, and
   genotype-y-environment interactions, although house fly courtship may
   remain a unique model where learning is an intersexually selected trait.
   Future development of more sophisticated molecular techniques for the M.
   domestica genome will help unravel the underlying biochemical and
   developmental pathways of these quantitative genetic interactions for a
   more complete understanding of the processes of inbreeding depression,
   outbreeding depression, and pleiotropy. (c) 2005, Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic basis of morphological traits in social insects remains
   largely unexplored. This is even true for individual body size, a key
   life-history trait. In the social insects, the size of reproductive
   individuals affects dispersal decisions, so that small size in queens is
   often associated with reduced dispersal, and large size with long-range
   dispersal and independent colony founding. Worker size is connected to
   division of labour when workers specialize in certain tasks according to
   their size. In many species, variation in worker size has been shown to
   increase colony performance. In this study, we present the first
   evidence of an additive genetic component to queen size in ants, using
   maternal half sib analysis. We also compared intra-colony size variation
   in colonies with high (queen doubly mated) versus low (queen singly
   mated) genetic variability. We found a high and significant heritability
   (h(2)=0.51) for queen size in one of the two study years, but not in the
   other. Size variation among queens was greater in colonies headed by a
   doubly mated queen in one of the study years, but not in the other. This
   indicates that genetic factors can influence queen size, but that
   environmental factors may override these under some circumstances. The
   heritability for worker size was low (h(2)=0.09) and non-significant.
   Increased genetic diversity did not increase worker size variation in
   the colonies. Worker size appeared largely environmentally determined,
   potentially allowing colonies to adjust worker size ratios to current
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In polygynous mammals, high-quality females may increase their fitness
   by providing superior care to their offspring. Based on the agonistic
   interactions of female reindeer in an experimental herd during two
   consecutive years (1997 and 1998), we tested whether maternal social
   rank influenced: (1) winter body-mass change of females, (2)
   preparturition reproductive effort (measured as fecundity, the birth
   mass and the birth date of their calves), (3) preweaning maternal effort
   (measured as calves' preweaning mortality, early preweaning and late
   preweaning growth rate and September body mass of calves), and (4)
   postweaning maternal effort (measured as calves' body-mass change during
   their first winter). In the models, we included September females' body
   mass as a covariate to separate the effects of maternal rank and body
   mass. We also tested whether the effect of social rank on maternal
   efforts was dependent on offspring sex. High-ranked females gained body
   mass whereas low-ranked females lost weight during the winter. Fecundity
   was higher and date of birth was earlier in high-ranked females than in
   subordinates, whereas no effect of females' rank on birth mass of calves
   was found. Early preweaning growth rate and September body mass of
   calves increased with increasing females' social rank, whereas late
   preweaning daily growth rate of calves was not influenced by females'
   rank. Calves' preweaning mortality was only influenced by year, which
   also explained most of the variance in the winter body-mass change of
   calves. The effects of females' rank on the reproductive-efforts
   parameters studied were not specific to offspring sex. These findings
   suggest that females' rank influences reproductive effort during the
   preparturition, as well as the preweaning, period, the effect being sex
   independent.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals of all vertebrate species differ consistently in their
   reactions to mildly stressful challenges. These typical reactions,
   described as personalities or coping strategies, have a clear genetic
   basis, but the structure of their inheritance in natural populations is
   almost unknown. We carried out a quantitative genetic analysis of two
   personality traits (exploration and boldness) and the combination of
   these two traits (early exploratory behaviour). This study was carried
   out on the lines resulting from a two-directional artificial selection
   experiment on early exploratory behaviour (EEB) of great tits (Parus
   major) originating from a wild population. In analyses using the
   original lines, reciprocal F-1 and reciprocal first backcross
   generations, additive, dominance, maternal effects ands sex-dependent
   expression of exploration, boldness and EEB were estimated. Both
   additive and dominant genetic effects were important determinants of
   phenotypic variation in exploratory behaviour and boldness. However, no
   sex-dependent expression was observed in either of these personality
   traits. These results are discussed with respect to the maintenance of
   genetic variation in personality traits, and the expected genetic
   structure of other behavioural and life history traits in general.}},

Abstract = {{Predation is heterogeneously distributed across space and time, and is
   presumed to represent a major source of evolutionary diversification. In
   fishes, fast-starts-sudden, high-energy swimming bursts-are often
   important in avoiding capture during a predator strike. Thus, in the
   presence of predators, we might expect evolution of morphological
   features that facilitate increased fast-start speed. We tested this
   hypothesis using populations of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis)
   that differed in level of predation by piscivorous fish. Body morphology
   of G. affinis males, females, and juveniles diverged in a consistent
   manner between predatory environments. Fish collected from predator
   populations exhibited a larger caudal region, smaller head, more
   elongate body, and a posterior, ventral position of the eye relative to
   fish from predator-free populations. Divergence in body shape largely
   matched a priori predictions based on biomechanical principles, and was
   evident across space (multiple populations) and time (multiple years).
   We measured maximum burst-swimming speed for male mosquitofish and found
   that individuals from predator populations produced faster bursts than
   fish from predator-free populations (about 20\% faster). Biomechanical
   models of fish swimming and intrapopulation morphology-speed
   correlations suggested that body shape differences were largely
   responsible for enhanced locomotor performance in fish from predator
   populations. Morphological differences also persisted in offspring
   raised in a common laboratory environment, suggesting a heritable
   component to the observed morphological divergence. Taken together,
   these results strongly support the hypothesis that divergent selection
   between predator regimes has produced the observed phenotypic
   differences among populations of G. affinis. Based on biomechanical
   principles and recent findings in other species, it appears that the
   general ecomorphological model described in this paper will apply for
   many aquatic taxa, and provide insight into the role of predators in
   shaping the body form of prey organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Vertebrate eggs contain maternal steroid hormones in their yolks; and in
   avian species the concentration of these steroids vary within and among
   clutches. The organizational actions of these variable doses of maternal
   steroids in the avian egg, analogous to those regulating the development
   of sexually dimorphic traits, are little explored. In this study, we
   examined the organizational effects of yolk testosterone in the house
   sparrow, Passer domesticus, a sexually dichromatic passerine bird in
   which males are characterized by the presence of a throat patch or
   ``badge{''} of black feathers that varies in size among males. We
   injected a physiological dose of testosterone or vehicle into eggs in
   the field, removed nestlings, and hand-raised them in the laboratory. At
   5 months of age, we investigated treatment effects on plumage and
   behavior. Males that hatched from testosterone-injected eggs developed a
   larger badge than males that hatched from vehicle-injected (control)
   eggs. However, testosterone did not induce the expression of a badge in
   females. In staged dyadic encounters, both males and females hatched
   from testosterone-injected eggs were more successful at obtaining and
   defending a food source than individuals of the same sex hatched from
   control eggs. The results suggest that variable concentrations of
   maternal testosterone in the eggs of the house sparrow organize the
   expression of a plumage trait in males and behavior in both sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal inputs to offspring early in development are initially high but
   the process of development suggests that ontogenetic shifts in the
   importance of maternal genetic variation relative to other sources
   should occur. We investigated additive genetic variance and covariance
   for direct (animal), sire, and maternal effects on embryonic length
   (EL), yolk sac volume (YSV), and alevin (after yolk sac resorption)
   length (AL) for 460 embryonic and 460 alevin brook charr (Salvelinus
   fontinalis) in 23 half-sib families (12 sires, 23 dams). There were no
   additive genetic effects of sires or individual animals on their own
   phenotype using sire-dam and maternal-animal models for YSV or EL
   (h(a)(2) < 0.05). However, at the alevin stage we detected low but
   significant heritability for AL (h(a)(2) = 0.14 +/- a a 0.11).
   Conversely, maternal genetic effects were high for both embryonic traits
   (h(EL)(2) = 0.61 +/- 0.05; h(YSV)(2) = 0.57 +/- 0.06) but faded rapidly
   for postresorption length (h(AL)(2) = 0.18 +/- 0.04). Maternal effects
   in the sire-dam model corresponded highly with those in the animal-dam
   model. We did not detect significant genetic covariance between progeny
   and dams for preresorption traits or between sires and dams for any
   trait. However, following resorption of the yolk sac, the genetic value
   of dams for AL was negatively correlated with that of individual progeny
   (r(m.a) = -0.38 +/- 0.13), suggesting trade-offs and/or stabilizing
   selection between maternal and animal genetic trait value. This finding
   was supported by models of dam fecundity on offspring length and dam
   weight in phenotypic space. Heritability estimates using simple
   regression of embryo phenotype on adult parental phenotype produced
   upwardly biased estimates of genetic variance (h(2) > 1.0). We propose
   that development through the embryo-alevin boundary may be a major point
   in salmonids for ontogenetic changes in the genetic architecture of
   embryo size from maternal genetic effects to those of the individual
   organism, and that maternal-offspring conflicts in resource allocation
   related to size may be partially indicated by negative genetic
   covariance.}},

Abstract = {{The deleterious effects of inbreeding can be substantial in wild
   populations and mechanisms to avoid such matings have evolved in many
   organisms. In situations where social mate choice is restricted,
   extrapair paternity may be a strategy used by females to avoid
   inbreeding and increase offspring heterozygosity. In the cooperatively
   breeding Seychelles warbler, Acrocephalus sechellensis, neither social
   nor extrapair mate choice was used to avoid inbreeding facultatively,
   and close inbreeding occurred in approximately 5\% of matings. However,
   a higher frequency of extra-group paternity may be selected for in
   female subordinates because this did reduce the frequency of mating
   between close relatives. Inbreeding resulted in reduced individual
   heterozygosity, which, against expectation, had an almost significant (P
   = 0.052). positive effect on survival. Conversely, low heterozygosity in
   the genetic mother was linked to reduced offspring survival, and the
   magnitude of this intergenerational inbreeding depression effect was
   environment-dependent. Because we controlled for genetic effects and
   most environmental effects (through the experimental cross-fostering of
   nestlings), we conclude that the reduced survival was a result of
   maternal effects. Our results show that inbreeding can have complicated
   effects even within a genetic bottlenecked population where the
   ``purging'' of recessive alleles is expected to reduce the effects of
   inbreeding depression.}},

Abstract = {{Mating order can have important consequences for the fertilization
   success of males whose ejaculates compete to fertilize a clutch of eggs.
   Despite an excellent body of literature on mating-order effects in many
   animals, they have rarely been considered in marine free-spawning
   invertebrates, where both sexes release gametes into the water column.
   In this study, we show that in such organisms, mating order can have
   profound repercussions for male reproductive success. Using in vitro
   fertilization for two species of sea urchin we found that the
   `fertilization history' of a clutch of eggs strongly influenced the size
   distribution of unfertilized eggs, and consequently the likelihood that
   they will be fertilized. Males that had first access to a batch of eggs
   enjoyed elevated fertilization success because they had privileged
   access to the largest and therefore most readily fertilizable eggs
   within a clutch. By contrast, when a male's sperm were exposed to a
   batch of unfertilized eggs left over from a previous mating event,
   fertilization rates were reduced, owing to smaller eggs remaining in egg
   clutches previously exposed to sperm. Because of this size-dependent
   fertilization, the fertilization history of eggs also strongly
   influenced the size distribution of offspring, with first-spawning males
   producing larger, and therefore fitter, offspring. These findings
   suggest that when there is variation in egg size, mating order will
   influence not only the quantity but also the quality of offspring sired
   by competing males.}},

Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the role of individual variation among female red deer
   (Cervus elaphus) on the body mass of their offspring based on the
   long-term monitoring (1977-1996) of a Norwegian population. We studied
   273 calves weighed in winter, belonging to 114 mothers of known age.
   After accounting for yearly variation, we found that calf body mass
   increased with the age of their mother until mothers were 6 years of
   age, then leveled off until 15 years of age. Body mass varied from year
   to year in similar ways for male and female calves. Winter harshness,
   and density when calves were in utero, could account for only a small
   part of this variation. Variation in calf body mass could be decomposed
   into a climatic component, determining the mean body mass of a cohort,
   and a mother component, determining the position of calves' body mass
   relative to the mean of their cohort. The mother effect could be further
   decomposed into an effect of the mother's age and an effect of the
   mother's quality. The latter explained >35\% of the body mass variation
   in male calves, and similar to15\% in females, while the proportions of
   the variation due to cohort effect were 28\% and 42\%, respectively. The
   mother's quality effect was therefore sex-specific and accounted for
   similar to1.5 times more of the variance in male than female body mass.
   Females with relatively long jawbones for their age had larger calves.
   We supported the hypothesis that female's quality influences the quality
   of her offspring and that this effect lingered until after the end of
   the weaning period. Our results suggest that the variance in
   reproductive success among females is certainly larger than previously
   thought in red deer.}},

Volume = {{140}},

Pages = {{302-311}},

Abstract = {{Environmental variation in food resources modifies performance of
   herbivores, in addition to genetic variation and maternal effects. In
   marine benthic habitats, eutrophication may modify herbivores' diets by
   changing host species composition or nutritional quality of algae for
   herbivores. We studied experimentally the effects of diet breadth and
   nutrient availability for the host algae on fitness components of the
   herbivorous isopod Idotea baltica. We fed the adult isopods with the
   brown algae Fucus vesiculosus and Pilayella littoralis and juveniles
   with the green alga Cladophora glomerata. By using half-sib families, we
   were able to separate the genetic, environmental and maternal effects on
   intermolt duration and size of the juveniles. The mothers confined to
   the diet consisting of both Fucus and Pilayella grew better and produced
   larger egg mass than those having consumed Fucus alone. Nutrient
   enhancement of algae did not influence the performance of the adult
   herbivores. However, the juveniles achieved twice the weight as well as
   shorter intermolt duration when consuming nutrient-treated C. glomerata.
   Mother's nutrition, either nutrient enrichment of her food algae or diet
   breadth, did not affect juvenile survival or growth as such, but we
   found evidence that the broader diet consumed by the mother mediated
   offspring performance by further accelerating growth rate of the
   offspring that fed on nutrient-treated alga. Intermolt duration was a
   highly heritable trait, but size showed very low heritability. Instead,
   maternal effects on size were substantial, suggesting that differences
   among mothers in their egg-provisioning ability strongly affect weight
   gain of their offspring. A high amount of additive genetic variance in
   intermolt duration implies potential for quick evolutionary responses in
   the growth schedule in the face of changes in the selective environment.
   We conclude that eutrophication, in addition to improving growth and
   reproduction of I. baltica by enhancing food quality and by providing
   opportunity for broader, more profitable diets, may act as a selective
   agent on life-history traits. Eutrophication of coastal waters is thus
   likely to reflect in herbivore density, population dynamics and
   eventually, grazing pressure of littoral macroalgae.}},

Abstract = {{Birds usually influence offspring survival through the amount of
   parental care they provide. Megapodes have evolved a different life
   history. Eggs are incubated by external heat sources, and chicks dig
   themselves out of their underground nest and live independently of their
   parents. Egg size is one of the few means by which females can influence
   chick survival. We found that in the Australian Brush-turkey, Alectura
   lathami Gray, 1831, eggs and hatchlings varied considerably in size,
   with a ratio of 1.62 between the largest and the smallest egg. Egg size
   was positively correlated with hatchling body mass and tarsus length. It
   also significantly predicted the chicks' motor performance: chicks from
   larger eggs dug their way out of their underground nest faster and were
   more active when kept in a resting box and monitored by motion detection
   software. The main advantage of reaching the surface more quickly is
   likely that such chicks will have more time to find suitable food,
   refuge, and a tree for roosting at night while still feeding on their
   internal yolk reserves. Egg size also interacted significantly with body
   mass during the first 10 months of life. A size advantage at hatching
   thus seems to have an immediate effect on motor performance and a longer

Abstract = {{The expression of most developmental or behavioral traits involves
   complex interactions between quantitative trait loci (QTL) from the

   a pivotal role in shaping the direction and rate of evolution in terms
   of their substantial contribution to quantitative genetic (co)variation.
   To study the genetics and evolution of maternal-offspring interactions,
   a unifying statistical framework that embraces both the direct and
   indirect genetic effects of maternal and offspring QTL on any complex
   trait is developed. This model is derived for a simple backcross design
   within the maximum-likelihood context, implemented with the EM
   algorithm. Results front extensive simulations suggest that this model
   can provide reasonable estimation of additive and dominant effects of
   the QTL at different generations and their interaction effects derived
   from the maternal and offspring genomes. Although our model is trained
   to characterize the actions and interactions of maternal and offspring
   QTL affecting offspring traits, the idea can be readily extended to
   decipher the genetic machinery of maternal traits, Such as maternal
   care. Our model provides a powerful means for studying the evolutionary

Abstract = {{Adaptations to the cold and to short growing seasons characterize arctic
   life, but climate in the Arctic is warming at an unprecedented rate.
   Will plant and animal populations of the Arctic be able to cope with
   these drastic changes in environmental conditions? Here we explore the
   potential contribution of evolution by natural selection to the current
   response of populations to climate change. We focus on the spring
   phenology of populations because it is highly responsive to climate
   change and easy to document across a wide range of species. We show that
   evolution can be fast and can occur at the time scale of a few decades.
   We present an example of reproductive phenological change associated
   with climate change (North American red squirrels in the Yukon), where a
   detailed analysis of quantitative genetic parameters demonstrates
   contemporary evolution. We answer a series of frequently asked questions
   that should help biologists less familiar with evolutionary theory and
   quantitative genetic methods to think about the role of evolution in
   current responses of ecological systems to climate change. Our
   conclusion is that evolution by natural selection is a pertinent force
   to consider even at the time scale of contemporary climate changes.
   However, all species may not be equal in their capacity to benefit from
   contemporary evolution.}},

Abstract = {{We explored how morphological and physiological traits associated with
   energy expenditure over long periods of cold exposure would be
   integrated in a potential response to natural selection in a wild
   mammal, Phyllotis darwini. In particular, we studied sustained energy
   expenditure (SusMR), the rate of expenditure fueled by concurrent energy
   intake, basal metabolic rate (BMR), and sustained metabolic scope (SusMS
   = SusMR/BMR), a measure of the reserve for sustained work. We included
   the masses of different central processing organs as an underlying
   factor that could have a mechanistic link with whole animal traits. Only
   the liver had heritability statistically different from zero (0.73).
   Physiological and morphological traits had high levels of specific
   environmental variance (average 70\%) and postnatal common environmental
   variance (average 30\%) which could explain the low heritabilities
   estimates. Our results, (1) are in accordance with previous studies in
   mammals that report low heritabilities for metabolic traits (SusMR, BMR,
   SusMS), (2) but not completely with previous ones that report high
   heritabilities for morphological traits (masses of central organs), and
   (3) provide important evidence of the relevance of postnatal common
   environmental variance to sustained energy expenditure.}},

Abstract = {{Mothers often provide much of the early environment for their offspring.
   These maternal effects are predicted to result in unusual evolutionary
   dynamics in offspring traits if they are themselves heritable, but these
   important predictions have not previously, to our knowledge, been tested
   in the wild. Here, we quantified the responses of red squirrels
   (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) to documented episodes of natural selection
   and found support for both of the fundamental predictions of models that
   describe maternal effect evolution. First, changes in juvenile growth
   rates across one generation of selection were five times greater than
   predicted by heritability (h(2)) alone, but were consistent with the
   additional contribution of maternal genetic effects. Second, responses
   to selection were influenced not only by the strength of selection in
   the current generation, but also by selection in the previous
   generation, indicating the presence of evolutionary momentum. These
   results were in agreement with predictions of a simple model including
   litter size as the only maternal effect, and provide, to our knowledge,
   the first empirical evidence for the importance of maternal effects to
   evolutionary dynamics in a natural population.}},

Abstract = {{Niche construction refers to the capacity of organisms to construct,
   modify, and select important components of their local environments,
   Such as nests, burrows, pupal cases, chemicals, and nutrients. A small
   but increasing number of evolutionary biologists regard niche
   construction as an evolutionary process in its own right, rather than as
   a mere product of natural selection. Through niche construction
   organisms not only influence the nature of their world, but also in part
   determine the selection pressures to which they and their descendants
   are exposed, and they do so in a non-random manner. Mathematical
   population genetics analyses have revealed that niche construction is
   likely to be evolutionarily consequential because of the feedback that
   it generates in the evolutionary process. A parallel movement has
   emerged in ecosystem ecology, where researchers stress the utility of
   regarding organisms as ecosystem engineers,,who partly control energy
   and matter flows. From the niche construction standpoint, the evolving
   complementary match between organisms and environments is the product of
   reciprocal interacting processes of natural selection and niche
   construction. This essay reviews the arguments put forward in favor of
   the niche-construction perspective.}},

Abstract = {{The past 30 years of immunological research have revealed much about the
   proximate mechanisms of maternal antibody transmission and utilization,
   but have not adequately addressed how these issues are related to
   evolutionary and ecological theory. Much remains to be learned about
   individual differences within a species in maternal antibody
   transmission as well as differences among species in transmission or
   utilization of antibodies. Similarly, maternal-effects theory has
   generally neglected the mechanisms by which mothers influence offspring
   phenotype. Although the environmental cues that generate maternal
   effects and the consequent effects for offspring phenotype are often
   well characterized, the intermediary physiological and developmental
   steps through which the maternal effect is transmitted are generally
   unknown. Integration of the proximate mechanisms of maternal antibody
   transmission with evolutionary theory on maternal effects affords an
   important opportunity to unite mechanism and process by focusing on the
   links between genetics, environment and physiology, with the ultimate
   goal of explaining differences among individuals and species in the
   transfer of immune function from one generation to the next.}},

Abstract = {{A thorough knowledge of relationships between host genotype and immunity
   to parasitic infection is required to understand parasite-mediated
   mechanisms of genetic and population change. It has been suggested that
   immunity may decline with inbreeding. However, the relationship between
   inbreeding level and a host's response to a novel immune challenge has
   not been investigated in a natural population. We used the pedigreed
   population of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) inhabiting Mandarte
   Island, Canada, to test the hypothesis that a sparrow's cell-mediated
   immune response (CMI) to an experimental challenge would decline with
   individual or parental inbreeding. CMI in 6-day-old chicks declined
   significantly with their mother's coefficient of inbreeding,
   demonstrating an inter-generational effect of maternal inbreeding on
   offspring immunity. In fledged juveniles and adult sparrows, CMI
   declined markedly with an individual's own coefficient of inbreeding,
   but not its mother's. This relationship was consistent across seasons,
   and was not attributable solely to heterosis in offspring of immigrant
   breeders. CMI also declined with age and increased with body condition
   in adult sparrows, but inbreeding explained 37\% of the total variation.
   We emphasize the implications of this dramatic inbreeding depression in
   cell-mediated immunity for theories of parasite-mediated evolution and
   the susceptibility of small, inbred populations.}},

Abstract = {{Female ornamentation has long been overlooked because of the greater
   prevalence of elaborate displays in males. However, the circumstances
   under which females would benefit from honestly signalling their quality
   are limited. Females are not expected to invest in ornamentation unless
   the fitness benefits of the ornament exceed those derived from investing
   the resources directly into offspring. It has been proposed that when
   females gain direct benefits from mating, females may instead be
   selected for ornamentation that deceives males about their reproductive
   state. In the empidid dance flies, males frequently provide nuptial
   gifts and it is usually only the female that is ornamented. Female
   traits in empidids, such as abdominal sacs and enlarged pinnate leg
   scales, have been proposed to `deceive' males into matings by disguising
   egg maturity. We quantified sexual selection in the dance fly
   Rhamphomyia tarsata and found escalating, quadratic selection on pinnate
   scales and that pinnate scales honestly reflect female fecundity. Mated
   females had a larger total number and more mature eggs than unmated

   which parents feed offspring. This measure of effort is positively
   related to offspring survival, is repeatable within individuals, and
   does not appear to be confounded by environmental effects. Using both
   parent-offspring regression, and an animal model approach, with a

Abstract = {{Natural selection can operate at the individual and group level in
   natural populations. This study investigates the ecological factors that
   determine the relative importance of individual versus group selection.
   In particular, it determines how the relatedness of interacting
   neighbors influences multilevel natural selection in a population of the
   Great Lakes sea rocket. Focal plants were grown in groups of siblings,
   groups of plants that were themselves siblings but unrelated to the
   focal plants, and groups of plants with mixed genotypes. Significant
   group selection on plant size was observed only when the neighbors were
   siblings but not when they were unrelated. In sibling groups,
   individuals with heavier stems had higher fitness, and individuals
   growing with heavier but shorter neighbors also had higher fitness.
   Thus, individual and group selection on stem weight operated in the same
   direction. The detection of group selection in sibling groups can be
   attributed in part to an increased opportunity for group selection in
   these groups since sibling groups differed more from one another than
   the other group types. In addition, the quality of the selective
   environment in sibling groups may have differed from that for the other
   group types. Group selection was therefore more prevalent in the most
   genetically structured sample, in which responses to group selection are
   also most likely to occur.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, doubt has been cast on studies supporting good genes sexual
   selection by the suggestion that observed genetic benefits for offspring
   may be confounded by differential maternal allocation. In traditional
   analyses, observed genetic sire effects on offspring phenotype may
   result from females allocating more resources to the offspring of
   attractive males. However, maternal effects such as differential
   allocation may represent a mechanism promoting genetic sire effects,
   rather than an alternative to them. Here we report results from an
   experiment on the horned dung beetle Onthophagus taurus, in which we
   directly compare genetic sire effects with maternal effects that are
   dependent on sire phenotype. We found strong evidence that mothers
   provide more resources to offspring when mated with large-horned males.
   There were significant heritabilities for both horn length and body
   size, but when differential maternal effects were controlled, the
   observed estimates of genetic variance were greatly reduced. Our
   experiment provides evidence that differential maternal effects may
   amplify genetic effects on offspring traits that are closely related to
   fitness. Thus, our results may partly explain the relatively high
   coefficients of additive genetic variation observed in fitness-related
   traits and provide empirical support for the theoretical argument that
   maternal effects can play an important role in evolution.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the hypothesis that females choose to mate with heavier males

Abstract = {{The ability of plants to sense their environment gives them the capacity
   to respond to it plastically. Plastic responses, in turn, frequently
   alter the environment that plants experience. Plants can modify the
   environment they experience through many mechanisms-some approximate but
   others quite precise. The ability of plants to modify the environment
   they experience can strongly influence the evolution of characters
   expressed subsequently. A review of some theoretical models of habitat
   selection and of the coevolution of characters and their environments
   highlights the importance of habitat selection in plants. Novel
   evolutionary trajectories and outcomes result when organisms are capable
   of modifying the environment they experience. Specifically, characters
   can evolve even if they have no genetic variation, and plasticity in
   environment-determining characters may promote specialization in others.
   Divergence and reproductive isolation may even be augmented by
   habitat-selecting behavior in plants. An understanding of basic
   character evolution and the evolution of plasticity in plants requires
   an appreciation of the ability of plants to modify the environment they

Abstract = {{The environment provided by conspecifics is often the most important
   component of the environment experienced by individuals, frequently
   having profound effects on fitness and trait expression. Although these
   social effects on fitness and trait expression may appear to be purely
   environmental, they differ from other sorts of environmental influences,
   because they can have a genetic basis and thus can contribute to
   evolution. Theory has shown that these effects modify the definition of
   genetic architecture by making the phenotype the property of the
   genotypes of multiple individuals and alter evolutionary dynamics by
   introducing additional heritable components contributing to trait
   evolution. These effects suggest that genetic and evolutionary analyses
   of traits influenced by social environments must incorporate the genetic
   components of variation contributed by these environments. However,
   empirical studies incorporating these effects are generally lacking. In
   this paper, I quantify the contribution of genetically based
   environmental effects arising from social interactions during group
   rearing to the quantitative genetics of body size in Drosophila
   melanogaster. The results demonstrate that the genetic architecture of
   body size contains an important component of variation contributed by
   the social environment, which is hidden to ordinary genetic analyses and
   opposes the direct effects of genes on body-size development within a
   population. Using a model of trait evolution, I show that these effects
   significantly alter evolutionary predictions by providing hidden
   constraints on phenotypic evolution. The importance of relatedness of
   interactants and the potential impact of kin selection on the evolution
   of body size are also examined.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic development and ontogeny occupy what is often depicted as the
   black box between genes - the genotype - and the features ( structures,
   functions, behaviors) of organisms - the phenotype; the phenotype is not
   merely a one-to-one readout of the genotype. The gene's home, context,
   and locus of operation is the cell. Initially, in ontogeny, that cell is
   the single-celled zygote. As development ensues, multicellular
   assemblages of like cells ( modules) progressively organized as germ
   layers, embryonic fields, anlage, condensations, or blastemata, enable
   genes to play their roles in development and evolution. As modules,
   condensations are fundamental developmental and selectable units of
   morphology ( morphogenetic units) that mediate interactions between
   genotype and phenotype via evolutionary developmental mechanisms. In a
   hierarchy of emergent processes, gene networks and gene cascades (
   genetic modules) link the genotype with morphogenetic units such as
   condensations, while epigenetic processes such as embryonic inductions,
   tissue interactions and functional integration, link morphogenetic units
   to the phenotype. To support these conclusions I distinguish units of
   heredity from units of transmission and discuss epigenetic inheritance
   by tracing the history of relationship between embryology and evolution,
   especially the role(s) assigned to cells or to cellular components in
   generating theories of morphological change in evolution. The concept of
   cells as modular morphogenetic units is modeled and illustrated using
   the mammalian dentary bone.}},

Abstract = {{We present evidence that the heritable genetic variation within
   individual species, especially dominant and keystone species, has
   community and ecosystem consequences. These consequences represent
   extended phenotypes, i.e., the effects of genes at levels higher than
   the population. Using diverse examples from microbes to vertebrates, we
   demonstrate that the extended phenotype can be traced from the
   individuals possessing the trait, to the community, and to ecosystem
   processes such as leaf litter decomposition and N mineralization. In our
   development of a community genetics perspective, we focus on
   intraspecific genetic variation because the extended phenotypes of these
   genes can be passed from one generation to the next, which provides a
   mechanism for heritability. In support of this view, common-garden
   experiments using synthetic crosses of a dominant tree show that their
   progeny tend to support arthropod communities that resemble those of
   their parents. We also argue that the combined interactions of extended
   phenotypes contribute to the among-community variance in the traits of
   individuals within communities. The genetic factors underlying this
   among-community variance in trait expression, particularly those
   involving genetic interactions among species, constitute community
   heritability. These findings have diverse implications. (1) They provide
   a genetic framework for understanding community structure and ecosystem
   processes. The effects of extended phenotypes at these higher levels
   need not be diffuse; they may be direct or may act in relatively few
   steps, which enhances our ability to detect and predict their effects.
   (2) From a conservation perspective, we introduce the concept of the
   minimum viable interacting population (MVIP), which represents the size
   of a population needed to maintain genetic diversity at levels required
   by other interacting species in the community. (3) Genotype X
   environment interactions in dominant and keystone species can shift
   extended phenotypes to have unexpected consequences at community and
   ecosystem levels, an issue that is especially important as it relates to
   global change. (4) Documenting community heritability justifies a
   community genetics perspective and is an essential first step in
   demonstrating community evolution. (5) Community genetics requires and
   promotes an integrative approach, from genes to ecosystems, that is
   necessary for the marriage of ecology and genetics. Few studies span
   from genes to ecosystems, but such integration is probably essential for

Abstract = {{One specialized environment that can influence development arises in the
   context of social interactions, including the environment contributed by
   a sexual partner during sexual reproduction. It is often difficult,
   however, to separate out the effect of mating (fertilization) from the
   effect of social environment. In the study reported here we examine the
   effect of social environment mediated by a pheromonal signal on the
   fertility and fecundity of the facultatively parthenogenetic cockroach
   Nauphoeta cinerea. By examining parthenogenetically reproducing females,
   we isolate the effects of social environment in the absence of mating or
   fertilization. Females exposed to male odors are more likely to produce
   parthenogenetic offspring. Further, increased exposure to the male
   pheromone increases the number of offspring produced. Variation in
   timing of reproduction is also dependent on the male. Thus, social
   environments are a mechanism by which males contribute to the
   development of their offspring, resulting in variation in development.
   This study illustrates the potential evolutionary importance of social
   environments in development, because a requirement for male-contributed
   environments may be a constraint to evolving asexual reproduction from a
   sexually reproducing species.}},

   responses and differences between immune responses of mothers as
   covariables that accounted for a significant proportion of variance in
   nestling immunocompetence. This suggests that those variables can also
   be used in multiple regression analyses to explore genetic and
   environmental effects on nestling traits. Finally, we use differences
   among nestlings (siblings, non-siblings and reared or not in the same
   nest) while using trait values of mothers and differences between

Abstract = {{The rapid expansion of genomic and molecular genetic techniques in model
   organisms, and the application of these techniques to organisms that are
   less well studied genetically, make it possible to understand the
   genetic control of many behavioral phenotypes. However, many behavioral
   ecologists are uncertain about the value of including a genetic
   component in their studies. In this article, we review how genetic
   analyses of behavior are central to topics ranging from understanding
   past selection and predicting future evolution to explaining the neural
   and hormonal control of behavior. Furthermore, we review both new and
   old techniques for studying evolutionary behavior genetics and highlight
   how the choice of approach depends on both the question and the
   organism. Topics discussed include genetic architecture, detecting the
   past history of selection, and genotype-by-environment interactions. We
   show how these questions are being addressed with techniques including
   statistical genetics, QTL analyses, transgenic analyses, and
   microarrays. Many of the techniques were first applied to the behavior
   of genetic model organisms such as laboratory mice and flies. Two recent
   developments serve to expand the relevance of such studies to behavioral
   ecology. The first is to use model organisms for studies of the genetic
   basis of evolutionarily relevant behavior and the second is to apply
   methods developed in model genetic systems to species that have not
   previously been examined genetically. These conceptual advances, along
   with the rapid diversification of genetic tools and the recognition of
   widespread genetic homology, suggest a bright outlook for evolutionary
   genetic studies. This review provides access to tools through references
   to the recent literature and shows the great promise for evolutionary
   behavioral genetics.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Heritabilities, commonly used to predict evolutionary-potential, are
   notoriously low for behaviors. Apart from strong contributions of
   environmental variance in reducing heritabilities, the additive genetic
   components can be very low, especially when they are camouflaged by
   nonadditive genetic effects. We first report the heritabilities of
   courtship traits in founder-flush and control populations of the
   housefly (Musca domestica L.). We estimated the heritability of each
   male and female display through the regression of the courtships
   involving daughters and sons (with randomly selected mates) onto the
   ``midparental{''} courtship values of their parents. Overall, the
   average heritability was significantly (P=.012) higher for the
   parent-daughter assays than for the parent-son assays. We attributed the
   low (even negative) heritabilities to genotype-by-environment
   interactions whereby the male's behavior is influenced by the
   ``environment{''} of his mating partner's preferences for the display,
   generating epistasis through indirect genetic effects. Moreover,
   bottlenecked lines had up to 800\% of the heritability of the controls,
   suggesting ``conversion{''} of additive genetic variance from
   nonadditive components. Second, we used line-cross assays on separate
   populations that had been selected for divergence in mating behavior to
   identify dominance and epistasis through heterosis and outbreeding
   depression in courtship. Finally, our literature review confirms the
   prevalence of such low heritabilities (i.e., a conservative mean of
   0.38) and nonadditive genetics in other behavioral repertoires (64\% of
   the studies). We conclude that animal behavior is especially prone to
   the gamut of quantitative genetic complexities that can result in
   negative heritabilities, negative selection responses, inbreeding
   depression, conversion, heterosis, and outbreeding depression.}},

Abstract = {{Although the argument over genetic influences on social dominance is
   contentious, genetic models of interacting phenotypes provide a
   theoretical framework for heritable effects on, and therefore evolution
   of, social behavior. Here we adapt the interacting phenotype model to
   show how social dominance can evolve. Our model makes a number of
   predictions: rapid evolution of behavior, strong correlated responses in
   associated traits (such as a badge of status), and, because context is
   important for social dominance, integrated evolution of both dominant
   and subordinate behavior reflecting direct and indirect genetic effects
   and social selection. We also describe the results of empirical work,
   artificial selection based on social status within a hierarchy in the
   cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea, that we used to test the predictions of our
   model. There was little change within selection lines in the expression
   of agonistic behavior, but by just generation 7 of selection, in
   comparisons between lines, high-line males consistently dominated low
   and control males, while low-line males were consistently subordinate to
   high-line and control males. There was a strong correlated response to
   selection in the pheromonal badge of status. Some correlated responses
   to selection differed among replicate lines, with the compound that
   makes males subordinate changed in one replicate, while the compound
   that confers dominance was altered in the other. Overall, our results
   are consistent with predictions from models of interacting phenotypes:
   social dominance is influenced by additive genetic variation, can evolve
   as a result of social selection, and evolution of social interactions
   appears to be rapid. Finally, different responses in the replicates
   allowed us to test very specific predictions regarding the role of the
   social pheromone in N. cinerea, highlighting the value of artificial
   selection experiments as a tool in evolutionary behavioral genetic
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{The basis of social evolution in mammals is the mother-offspring
   relationship. It is also the primary and most important instance of
   indirect genetic effects, where genetic variation in one individual
   affects phenotypic variation among others. this relationship is so
   important in mammals that often the major factor determining the life or
   death of newborns is the environment provided by their mother.
   Variations in these environments can be, due to variations in maternal
   genotypes. in our work with the intercross of two mouse inbred strains,
   LG/J and SM/J, we uncovered a very severe variation in maternal
   performance. These females failed to nurture their offspring and showed
   abnormal maternal behaviors. leading to loss of their litter. Rather
   than this being due to a single gene variant as in knockout mice, we
   uncovered a complex genetic basis for this trait. The effects of genes
   on maternal performance are entirely context dependent in our cross.
   They depend on the alleles present at the same or other epistatically
   interacting loci. Genomic locations identified in this study include
   locations of candidate genes whose knockouts displayed similar aberrant
   maternal behavior. Behaviors significantly associated with maternal
   performance in this study include suckling, nest building,
   placentophagia, pup grooming, and retrieval of pups after disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal performance refers to the effect that the environment provided
   by mothers has on their offspring's phenotypes, such as offspring
   survival and growth. Variations in maternal behavior and physiology are
   responsible for variations in maternal performance, which in turn
   affects offspring survival. In our study we found females that failed to
   nurture their offspring and showed abnormal maternal behaviors. The
   genetic architecture of maternal performance for offspring survival was
   investigated in 241 females of an F-2 intercross of the SM/J and LG/J
   inbred mouse strains. Using interval-mapping methods we found two
   quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting maternal performance at D2Mit17
   + 6 cM and D7Mit21 + 2 cM on chromosomes 2 and 7, respectively. In a
   two-way genome-wide epistasis scan we found 15 epistatic interactions
   involving 23 QTL distributed across all chromosomes except 12, 16, and
   17 These loci form several small sets of interacting QTL, suggesting a
   complex set of mechanisms operating to determine maternal performance
   for offspring survival. Taken all together and correcting for the large
   number of significant factors, QTL and their interactions explain almost
   35\% of the phenotypic variation for maternal performance for offspring
   survival in this cross. This study allowed the identification of many
   possible candidate genes, as well as the relative size of gene effects
   and patterns of gene action affecting maternal performance in mice.
   Detailed behavior observation of mothers from later generations suggests
   that offspring survival in the first week is related to maternal success
   in building nests, grooming their pups, providing milk, and/or
   manifesting aggressive behavior against intruders.}},

Abstract = {{Using literature data on reciprocal crosses, I estimated the influence
   of maternal effects on morphological and behavioral traits and compared
   these effects between mammals, birds, insects with homogametic females,
   and butterflies. In birds and in both groups of insects, no detectable
   difference between the reciprocal hybrids was observed on average,
   showing that in these groups, the contribution of maternal effects to
   the difference between the parental lines is at least rather small. In
   contrast to the other groups, mammals showed a significant and large
   Influence of maternal effects on the examined characters. The large
   maternal effects in mammals are probably due to the extended period of
   parental care during gestation and lactation. It is concluded that
   maternal effects contributing to differences between parental lines are
   only widespread and important in mammals. It should be noted that these
   results do not show that maternal effects are absent in other animals.
   In the three examined groups, maternal effects may only evolve much more
   slowly than traits influenced by nuclear genes.}},

Abstract = {{Existing approaches to characterizing quantitative trait loci (QTL)
   utilize a paradigm explicitly focused on the direct effects of genes,
   where phenotypic variation among individuals is mapped onto genetic
   variation of those individuals. For many characters, however, the
   genotype of the mother via its maternal effect accounts for a
   considerable portion of the genetically based variation in progeny
   phenotypes. Thus the focus on direct effect QTL may result in an
   insufficient or misleading characterization of genetic architecture due
   to the omission of the potentially important source of genetic variance
   contributed by maternal effects. We analyze the relative contribution of
   direct and maternal effect (ME) QTL to early growth in mice using a
   three-generation intercross of the Small (SM/J) and Large (LG/J) inbred
   mouse lineages. Using interval mapping and composite interval mapping,
   direct effect (DE) QTL for early growth (change in body mass during the
   interval from week 1 to 2) were detected in the F-2 generation of the
   intercross (n = 510), where no maternal genetic effect variance is
   present (all individuals are progeny of genetically identical F-1
   mothers). ME QTL were detected by treating the phenotypes of
   cross-fostered F-3 pups as a characteristic of their nurse-dam (n = 168
   dams with crossfostered progeny). Five DE QTL, significant at a
   chromosome wide level (a = 0.05), were detected, with two significant at
   a genome wide level. FourME QTL significant at the chromosome wide level
   were detected, with three significant at the genome wide level. A model
   containing only DE QTL accounted for 11.8\% of phenotypic variance,
   while a model containing only ME QTL accounted for 31.5\% of the among
   litter variance in growth. There was no evidence for pleiotropy of DE
   and ME loci since there was no overlap between loci detected in these
   two analyses. Epistasis between all pairs of loci was analyzed for both
   DEs and MEs. Ten pairs of loci showed significant epistasis for MEs
   (alpha = 0.05 corrected for multiple comparisons) while four pairs
   showed significant epistasis for DEs on early growth.}},

Abstract = {{1 An individual's phenotype may influence the expression of traits in
   its offspring. I tested whether maternal flowering phenology influenced
   offspring germination and thus life history schedule in two populations
   of Campanula americana . Autumn-germinating C. americana grow as annuals
   whereas individuals that germinate in the spring are biennials.
   2 Under near-natural conditions, early-season flowers produced seeds
   that were more likely to germinate in the autumn than late-season
   flowers, but spring germination was equally likely for all seeds.
   3 Seed mass (two of three years) and percentage and timing of
   germination under constant environmental conditions (all three years)
   did not vary across the reproductive season. External environmental
   factors are therefore more likely to contribute to seasonal changes in
   the probability of germinating in the autumn than are the
   characteristics of the seeds.
   4 The frequency of annual offspring varied among maternal plants. The
   association between the time a flower was open and offspring germination
   season suggests that evolution of life history schedule may be
   accomplished by altering maternal flowering phenology.
   5 The association between the time of a flower's anthesis and its fruit
   maturation was weaker in two years when water was limiting. Limited
   water also resulted in earlier seed maturation, and consequently a
   greater proportion of a population's seed being produced during the
   period when autumn germination was likely. This, in combination with
   differences between populations, suggests that the magnitude of maternal
   phenological effects varies across years and populations.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect effects are fundamental to the biocomplexity of ecological

   environmental change. Interest in indirect effects has expanded
   exponentially over the past 20 years. Indirect effects arise when direct

   species change the interaction between individuals of other species, or
   both. Past work, including many studies of marine food webs, has
   primarily documented the existence of indirect effects and how
   particular examples arise. Future challenges include (1) developing
   methods for the systematic detection of indirect effects, (2)
   documenting the functions describing different classes of interaction
   modifications, (3) exploring methods to predict indirect effects,
   including measurement of interaction strengths among species, (4)
   integrating time-scale differences into the theory of indirect effects,
   and (5) linking indirect effects and environmental variability.

Abstract = {{We performed a quantitative genetic study of oviposition behaviours and
   oviposition traits in the sand cricket Gryllus firmus. Egg survival in
   crickets depends on the depth at which they are inserted into the soil
   with the ovipositor. We examined whether egg depth depends on ovipositor
   length alone, or on both morphological and behavioural traits associated
   with oviposition. Heritability estimates were high (h(z) >0.5) for
   ovipositor length and small (h(2)=0.2) for oviposition behaviours.
   Negative genetic correlations between ovipositor length and some
   behavioural traits (digging depth and the behavioural component of egg
   depth) indicated compensation between oviposition traits on egg depth.
   Because of behavioural compensation, females with different ovipositor
   lengths subject to stabilizing selection on egg depth could have equal
   fitnesses. Females laid their eggs deeper, and their eggs were
   marginally more evenly distributed in dry than in wet sand. This
   suggests adaptive phenotypic plasticity in laying behaviour, but may
   also result from physical constraints of the substrate on the insertion
   of the ovipositor. The absence of significant between-family variation
   in oviposition traits in response to sand moisture indicates low
   evolutionary potential for phenotypic plasticity in oviposition traits
   according to soil moisture. In highly unpredictable environments,
   females could spread the risk of desiccation by laying eggs at different
   depths independently of environmental conditions (bet hedging). Our
   results show significant additive genetic influences on the ability of a
   female to spread risks as measured by genetic variation in egg
   distribution, suggesting that a bet-hedging strategy of egg laying has
   the potential to evolve in this population. (C) 2002 The Association for

Abstract = {{This paper uses a biopsychosocial theory of human bonding to explore the
   intergenerational transmission of bonding traits. More specifically, it
   examines how the nurturant bonding system of the mother affects the
   succorant bonding system of the young child. In the first section of the
   paper, we take the bonding framework proposed by Miller and Rodgers
   (2001) and elaborate its implications for mother-chiId dyads. Next, we
   describe the collection of data from 78 mothers prior to their pregnancy
   with an index child and again when that child is between the ages of two
   and four and a half. These data allow the creation of a number of mother
   and child variables that are derived from the bonding framework. Using
   these variables, we construct a temporally organized, structural
   equation model of maternal effects on the child, with the two main
   outcome variables being child security of attachment and child
   dependency. We then test the model using LISREL. Although the results
   are tentative and require further confirmatory research, they lend
   support to three broad hypotheses derived from the bonding framework. In
   particular, the results support the construct of a motivational
   substrate that affects both maternal childbearing and her child-rearing
   behaviors. They also indicate the importance of child temperament in the
   formation of the succorant bond. Finally, they demonstrate that the
   preconception nurturant characteristics of the mother have multiple
   effects on the two main outcome variables, child security of attachment
   and dependency. Two submodels based on predictors of these two outcomes
   reveal a number of pathways along which these effects take place. We
   conclude with a brief discussion of the lessons learned that might
   strengthen future studies of mother-child bonding and, more generally,
   the intergenerational transmission of bonding traits.}},

Abstract = {{While theoretical models of the evolution of parental care are based on
   the assumption of underlying genetic variance, surprisingly few
   quantitative genetic studies of this life-history trait exist.
   Estimation of the degree of genetic variance in parental care is
   important because it can be a significant source of maternal effects,
   which, if genetically based, represent indirect genetic effects. A major
   prediction of indirect genetic effect theory is that traits without
   heritable variation can evolve because of the heritable environmental
   variation that indirect genetic effects provide. In the dung beetle,
   Onthophagus taurus, females provide care to offspring by provisioning a
   brood mass. The size of the brood mass has pronounced effects on
   offspring phenotype. Using a half-sib breeding design we show that the
   weight of the brood mass females produce exhibits significant levels of
   additive genetic variance due to sires. However, variance caused by dams
   is considerably larger, demonstrating that maternal effects are also
   important. Body size exhibited low additive genetic variance. However,
   body size exerts a strong maternal influence on the weight of brood
   masses produced, accounting for 22\% of the nongenetic variance in
   offspring body size. Maternal body size also influenced the number of
   offspring produced but there was no genetic variance for this trait.
   Offspring body size and brood mass weight exhibited positive genetic and
   phenotypic correlations. We conclude that both indirect genetic effects,
   via maternal care, and nongenetic maternal effects, via female size,
   play important roles in the evolution of phenotype in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGE) of parental care performance and the
   direct-indirect covariance contribute substantially to total
   heritability in domesticated and laboratory mammals. For animals from
   natural populations empirical estimates of IGE are sparse. Thus, despite
   recent models relating IGE to evolution, evolutionary interpretations of
   IGE are limited. To address this deficit, we used a reciprocal
   cross-fostering breeding design to estimate environmental influences,
   direct and indirect genetic effects, and direct-indirect genetic
   covariances in the burying beetle Nicrophorus pustulatus to determine
   the evolutionary importance of IGE arising from variation in parental
   care performance. Carrion size positively affected adult mass and time
   on carrion, but had no effect on total development time. Males were
   slightly larger than females. For both mass and development, independent
   of these environmental influences, direct and indirect genetic effects
   were of moderate magnitude. Total genetic effects explained 36-50\% of
   the phenotypic variance in mass and size and 27-37\% of phenotypic
   variance in development time. Direct-indirect genetic covariances were
   zero or close to zero. Thus, for both mass and development time, the
   response to natural selection arising from environmental variation may
   be accelerated by the presence of IGE in N. pustulatus . The generality
   of this pattern and the evolutionary significance of IGE arising from
   parental care awaits further study of natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Fifty years ago, Peter Medawar and George Williams developed two
   now-classic theories for the evolution of senescence. In the past 20
   years, evolutionary biologists studying aging have developed explicit
   mathematical models of these theories, used these models to derive
   explicit predictions, and tested these predictions using a variety of
   approaches. But, we argue here, our singular focus on these models may
   have hindered progress in evolutionary studies of aging. Research in
   this area has not kept pace with dramatic advances in evolutionary
   theory and molecular genetics. Progress in evolutionary studies of aging
   will depend on a bold, integrative approach, incorporating evolutionary
   and molecular advances from other fields, along with the powerful
   statistical and mathematical tools now available. We discuss several
   specific examples where we may gain new insight into the causes of aging
   by looking to other evolutionary phenomena, including sexual conflict

Abstract = {{Maternal effects are widespread and can have dramatic influences on
   evolutianary dynamics, but their genetic basis has been measured rarely
   in natural populations. We used cross-fostering techniques and a
   long-term study of a natural population of red squirrels, Tamiasciurus
   hudsonicus, to estimate bath direct (heritability) and indirect
   (maternal) influences on the potential for evolution. Juvenile growth in
   both body mass and size had significant amounts of genetic variation
   (mass h(2)=0.10; size h(2)=0.33), but experienced large, heritable
   maternal effects. Growth in body mass also had a large positive
   covariance between direct and maternal genetic effects. The
   consideration of these indirect genetic effects revealed a greater than
   three-fold increase in the potential for evolution of growth in body
   mass (h(t)(2)=0.36) relative to that predicted by heritability alone.
   Simple heritabilities, therefore, may severely underestimate or
   overestimate the potential for evolution in natural populations of

Abstract = {{Previous studies have shown that colony social organization in
   Solenopsis invicta is under strong genetic control. Colonies containing
   some proportion of workers with the Bb or bb genotypes at the gene Gp-9
   display polygyne social organization (multiple reproductive queens per
   colony), whereas colonies with only BB workers express monogyne
   organization (single reproductive queen per colony). The hypothesis that
   the presence of workers bearing the b allele confers the polygyne social
   phenotype on a colony leads to the prediction that social organization
   can be manipulated by experimentally altering frequencies of adult
   workers bearing this allele. We did this by replacing queens in colonies
   of each social form with single queens of the alternate form, which
   differ in Gp-9 genotype. As worker Gp-9 genotype compositions changed,
   experimental colonies switched to the alternate social organization.
   These switches occurred when frequencies of workers with the b allele
   passed an identifiable threshold, such that colonies with fewer than 5\%
   such workers behaved like monogyne colonies and those with more than
   10\% behaved like polygyne colonies. Our data thus confirm the
   prediction that colony social organization in this ant can be altered by
   manipulating adult worker genotype compositions, and thereby support the
   hypothesis that the expression of polygyny requires the presence of
   adult workers bearing the b allele at Gp-9.}},

Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Despite a growing interest in the evolutionary aspects of maternal
   effects, few studies have examined the genetic consequences of maternal
   effects associated with parental care, To begin to provide data on
   nonlaboratory or nondomestic animals. we compared the effect of presence
   and absence of parental care on phenotype expression of larval mass and
   development time at different life-history stages in the burying beetle
   Nicrophorus pustulatus. This beetle has facultative cared parents can
   feed their larvae through regurgitation or digested carrion or offspring
   can reed by themselves from previously prepared carrion. To investigate
   larval responses to these two levels of care, including estimates of
   additive genetic effects, maternal effects, and genotype-by-environment
   interactions, we used a half-sibling split-family breeding
   experiment-raising half of the offspring, of a family in the presence of
   their mother and the other hair without their mother present, Larvae
   reared with their mother present were on average headier and developed
   faster, although some of the difference in development decreased or were
   eliminated by the adult stage. These results suggest that presence or
   absence of post-hatching maternal care plays an important role in
   phenotype expression early in life, whereas later the phenotype of the
   offspring is determined mainly by the genotype and/or unshared
   environmental effects. Our study also permitted Lis to examine the
   differences in genetic effects between the two care environments.
   Heritabilities, maternal/common environment effect, and most genetic
   correlations did not differ between the care treatments. Genetic
   analyses revealed substantial additive genetic effects For development
   time but small effects for measures of body mass. Maternal Plus common
   environment effects were high for measure,, of mass hut low for
   development time. suggesting that indirect genetic effects or maternal
   and/or common environment are less important for the evolution of
   development time than for mass. Estimates of genetic correlations
   revealed a trade-off between the duration of the two development stages
   after the offspring left the carrion. There also a negative genetic
   correlation between the time spent on carrion and the mass at 72 h, when
   mothers usually feeding. The analysis of genotype-by-environment
   interactions indicates substantial among maternal families in response
   to care. Presence or absence of parental care may therefore contribute
   to the additive genetic variance through its interaction,with the
   maternal component of the additive genetic variance. The presence of
   this interaction further suggests that parent may vary in care
   strategies, with some parents dispersing after preparation of the
   carrion and some parents staving with the larvae. This interaction may
   help maintain genetic variation in growth, development time, and
   parental care behavior. Additional work is needed, however, to quantify
   indirect genetic effects, and genetic variation in parental care
   behavior itself.}},

Abstract = {{We compared reproductive allocation and variation in condition and
   survivorship of two heritable female throat color morphs (orange and
   yellow) in a free-living population of side-blotched lizards (Uta
   stansburiana). Using path analysis and structural equation modeling, we
   investigated how variation in the social environment affected clutch
   size and egg mass and two condition traits (postlaying mass,
   immunological condition) and how these traits in turn affected female
   field survival. In the presence of many neighbors, both morphs increased
   their clutch sizes, although these effects were only significant in
   yellow females. In addition, yellow females increased their egg mass in
   the presence of many orange neighbors. Orange females surrounded by many
   orange neighbors showed sign of stress in the form of immunosuppression,
   whereas this effect was less pronounced in yellow females. The morphs
   also differed in the impact of variation in clutch size and egg mass on
   both condition traits. Finally, female morphotype and immune
   responsiveness affected fitness interactively, and hence these two
   traits showed signs of fitness epistasis: Selection gradients on this
   trait were opposite in sign in the two morphs. The correlational
   selection gradient (gamma (throatxantibody) (response)) between female
   throat color and antibody responsiveness was -0.365. Our data thus
   reveal important interactive effects such as genotype-by-environment
   interaction toward the social environment and morph-specific trade-offs
   as well as the occurrence of correlational selection. We discuss the use
   of naturally occurring and conspicuous genetic polymorphisms in field
   studies of selection and life-history allocation.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when the phenotype of an
   individual, and possibly its fitness, depends, at least in part, on the
   genes of its social partners. The effective result is that environmental
   sources of phenotypic variance can themselves evolve. Simple models have
   shown that IGEs can alter the rate and direction of evolution for traits
   involved in interactions. Here we expand the applicability of the theory
   of IGEs to evolution in metapopulations by including nonlinear
   interactions between individuals and population genetic structure.
   Although population subdivision alone generates some dramatic and
   nonintuitive evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes, the
   combination of nonlinear interactions with subdivision reveals an even
   greater importance of IGEs. The presence of genetic structure links the
   evolution of interacting phenotypes and the traits that influence their
   expression ({''}effector traits{''}) even in the absence of genetic
   correlations. When nonlinear social effects occur in subdivided
   populations, evolutionary response is altered and can even oppose the
   direction expected due to direct selection. Because population genetic
   structure allows for multilevel selection, we also investigate the role
   of IGEs in determining the response to individual and group selection.
   We find that nonlinear social effects can cause interference between
   levels of selection even when they act in the same direction. In some
   cases, interference can be so extreme that the actual evolutionary
   response to multilevel selection is opposite in direction to that
   predicted by summing selection at each level. This theoretical result
   confirms empirical data that show higher levels of selection cannot be
   ignored even when selection acts in the same direction at all levels.}},

   selectively advantageous when the trait is initially rare (i,e,, when it

   is controlled by a maternal effect gene, the difficulty of initial
   rarity may be overcome. Unlike a zygotically expressed gene, a
   maternally expressed aposematism gene will be hidden from selection
   because it is not phenotypically expressed in the first individual with

Abstract = {{Maternally derived hormones in cleidoic eggs have been implicated in
   mediating growth, behavior, and social interactions among offspring.
   Given these widespread and significant effects. hormonal investments
   have the potential to greatly influence fitness of offspring.
   Intraspecific variation can exist at three levels (within individual
   eggs, among eggs within clutches, and among eggs from different
   females), each of which has different implications for offspring. We
   characterized all three levels of variation in maternally derived
   androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) present in yolks of
   American coot eggs. We found no variation in testosterone levels within
   eggs which suggests that embryos are exposed to constant androgen levels
   during development. and that field-based yolk biopsies are an
   appropriate way to sample eggs for this species. Within clutches,
   early-laid eggs had higher androgen levels than late-laid eggs, and this
   pattern may exacerbate negative effects of hatching asynchrony on chicks
   from late-hatching eggs if androgens provide chicks with a behavioral or
   growth advantage over chicks from eggs with lower androgen levels.
   American coots lay large clutches, and unequal resource allocation among
   offspring may be the optimal strategy for females with access to limited
   resources. Most of the variation in androgen levels occurred among eggs
   from different females. Females nesting on ponds with two other pairs
   laid eggs with significantly higher androgen levels than females living
   on ponds with fewer pairs. This suggests that increased territory
   defense behaviors influence the levels of androgens allocated to eggs
   and may be one mechanism underlying density-dependent effects on
   reproduction.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal care and female-biased sex ratios are considered by many to he
   essential prerequisites for the evolution of eusocial behaviors among
   the hymenoptera. Using population genetic models, I investigate the
   evolution of genes that have positive maternal effects but negative,
   direct effects on offspring fitness. I find that, under many conditions,
   such genes evolve more easily in haplo-diploids than in diplo-diploids.
   In fact, the conditions are less restrictive than those of kin selection
   theory, which postulate genes with negative direct effects but positive
   sib-social effects. For example. the conditions permitting the evolution
   of maternal effect genes are not affected if females mart: multiply,
   whereas multiple mating reduces the efficacy of E;in selection by
   reducing genetic relatedness within colonies. Inbreeding also
   differentially facilitates evolution of maternal effect genes in
   haplo-diploids relative to diplo-diploids, although it does not
   differentially affect the evolution of sib-altruism genes. Furthermore,
   when the direct, deleterious pleiotropic effect is restricted to sons, a
   maternal effect gene can evolve when the beneficial maternal effect is
   less than half (with inbreeding, much less) of the deleterious effect on
   sons. For kin selection, however, the sib-social benefits must always
   exceed the direct costs because generic relatedness is always less than
   or equal to 1.0. The results suggest that haplo-diploidy facilitates (1)
   the evolution of maternal care, and (2) the evolution of maternal effect
   genes with antagonistic pleiotropic effects on sons. The latter effect
   may help explain the tendency toward female-biased sex ratios in
   haplo-diploids, especially those with inbreeding. I conclude that
   haplo-diploidy not only facilitates the evolution of sister-sister
   altruism by I;in selection but also facilitates the evolution of
   maternal care acid female-biased sex ratios, two prerequisites for
   eusociality.}},

Abstract = {{Incomplete knowledge of pedigrees sometimes limits the methods of
   estimating quantitative genetic parameters (heritability, genetic
   correlation) in nature and may result in estimates that are inflated by
   nongenetic sources of variation. North American garter snakes and their
   allies provide a model system for investigating evolutionary
   quantitative genetics, but estimates of quantitative genetic parameters
   in these snakes are mostly based on offspring-dam regression and
   full-sib analysis, methods that fail to discriminate between maternal
   genetic, maternal environmental, and direct genetic effects on traits of
   interest. Using data from the garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis, we
   demonstrate that microsatellite DNA markers can be used to identify
   full-sib sireships within litters in species that produce large numbers
   of offspring and in which multiple paternity is common. This allows
   estimation of quantitative genetic parameters using a maternal half-sib
   analysis in which sires are nested within dams. Six microsatellite DNA
   loci were scored for four wild-caught dams and their 73 offspring and
   revealed two full-sib sireships within each litter. Maternal half-sib
   analyses of scalation and behavior suggest that heritability may be
   lower and maternal effects larger than was previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical analyses have demonstrated a potential role for epistasis in
   many of the most important processes in evolution. These analyses
   generally assume that an individual's genes map directly to its
   phenotype and epistasis results from interactions among loci that
   contribute to the same biochemical or developmental pathways (termed
   physiological, or within-genotype, epistasis). For many characters,
   particularly those expressed early in life, an individual's phenotype
   may also be affected by genes expressed by its parents. The presence of
   these parental effects allows for interactions between the genes present
   in the parental and offspring genomes. When the phenotypic effect of a
   locus in the offspring depends on the alleles possessed by its parents,
   genotype-by-genotype. or among-genotype, epistasis occurs. The
   among-genotype epistasis resulting from parental effects may contribute
   to ruggedness of adaptive landscapes because early mortality often
   accounts for much of the variance in fitness in populations. To
   demonstrate how parent-offspring interactions can result in
   among-genotype epistasis, I use a two-locus model, with one maternal
   effect locus and one direct effect locus, each with two alleles.
   Dynamical equations are presented for the two-locus model and are
   directly contrasted with the dynamical equations derived for a model for
   physiological epistasis. The relationship between the evolutionary
   dynamics resulting from these two forms of epistasis is discussed. Three
   scenarios are presented to illustrate systems in which
   maternal-offspring, genotype-by-genotype epistasis may occur. The
   implications of maternal-offspring epistasis for quantitative-trait-loci
   studies are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Despite considerable empirical and theoretical work on the individual
   and population consequences of early development, little is known about
   the correlations between early mass and adult size or lifetime
   reproductive success of free-ranging mammals. Using a 26-year study of
   bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), we examined how mass as a lamb and mass
   gain as a yearling affected adult mass for both sexes, horn length of
   males and lifetime reproductive success of females at different
   population densities. Mass as a 3-week-old lamb was either weakly or not
   correlated with adult mass, horn length of adult males, or the number of
   lambs weaned over a ewe's lifetime. Weaning mass was correlated with
   most of these variables when the number of ewes in the population was
   taken into account. When weaning mass was controlled through partial
   correlation, mass as a yearling was correlated with adult mass of ewes
   but not with ewe reproductive success or with adult mass or horn length
   of rams. Lamb mass and number of ewes explained more of the variance in
   adult characteristics for males than for females. Our results suggest
   that mass gain during lactation, possibly but not necessarily related to
   the amount of maternal care received, affects adult mass and
   reproductive success. Females appear better able than males to
   compensate for poor early development, likely by postponing their first
   reproduction. Mass gain over several years and the number of ewes in the
   population strongly affect adult mass of both sexes and therefore can
   have profound effects on reproductive success of this long-lived species
   with a multi-year growth period.}},

Abstract = {{Life-history evolution in short-lived organisms has bean investigated
   extensively, but little is known empirically about the causes of the
   different life-history strategies of long-lived organisms. To explore
   this issue, we conducted experiments to evaluate natural selection
   acting on key traits during an important life-history stage of the
   red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans). We reared eggs from
   56 females in a seminatural common environment and released 356 of the
   resulting hatchlings in four replicates at a natural nesting area to
   assess offspring recapture probability as a measure of survivorship
   during the post-emergence migration. Larger body size of hatchling
   turtles was strongly favored by natural. selection overall (beta' =
   0.336, P < 0.001) and in each replicate. Although selection on body size
   was positive in all analyses, the form of selection varied depending on
   the inclusion of nonrecaptured presumed dead individuals in the
   statistical analyses. This result indicates that such analytical tools
   are sensitive to the common assumption in many mark-recapture studies
   that nonrecaptured individuals have no fitness (i.e., W = 0). The most
   likely explanation for the size-dependent recapture probabilities is
   differential mortality, because body size at release for survivors was
   significantly larger than body size at release for hatchlings found
   dead. This pattern of survivorship appeared to result from
   size-dependent predation. We suggest that the benefit of larger body
   size for hatchling turtles may reside in improved locomotor performance
   that reduces the duration of exposure of larger individuals to
   predation. This hypothesis is supported by significant negative
   correlations between measures of body size and time elapsed between
   release and recapture.}},

Abstract = {{In the Ram Mountain bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) population, ewes
   differing by more than 30\% in body mass weaned lambs with an average
   mass difference of only 3\%. Variability in adult body mass was partly
   due to additive genetic effects, but inheritance of weaning mass was
   weak. Maternal effects could obscure genetic effects in the phenotypic
   expression of weaning mass, particularly if they reflected strategies of
   maternal expenditure that varied according to ewe mass. We performed a
   quantitative genetic analysis to assess genetic and environmental
   influences on ewe mass and on maternal expenditure. We used the mean
   daughters/mother regression method and Derivative Free Restricted
   Maximum Likelihood models to estimate heritability (h(2)) of ewe mass
   and indices of maternal expenditure. We found additive genetic effects
   on phenotypic variation in maternal mass, in lamb mass at weaning
   (absolute maternal expenditure) and in weaning mass relative to maternal
   mass at weaning (relative maternal expenditure). Heritability suggests
   that maternal expenditure has the potential to evolve. The genetic
   correlation of ewe mass and absolute maternal expenditure was weak,
   while ewe mass and relative maternal expenditure were strongly
   negatively correlated. These results suggest additive genetic effects on
   mass-dependent reproductive strategies in bighorn ewes. Mass-dependent
   reproductive strategies could affect lamb survival and phenotypic
   variation in adult mass. As population density increased and
   reproduction became costlier, small females reduced maternal expenditure
   more than large females. Constraints on reproductive strategy imposed by
   variations in resource availability are therefore likely to differ
   according to ewe mass. A general trend for a decrease in maternal
   expenditure relative to maternal size in mammals suggests that
   size-dependent negative maternal effects may be common.}},

Abstract = {{Parents often have important influences on the development of traits in
   their offspring. One mechanism by which parents are able to influence
   offspring phenotype is through the level of care they provide. In
   onthophagine dung beetles, parents typically provision their offspring
   by packing dung fragments into a brood mass. Onthophagus taurus males
   can be separated into two discrete morphs: Large, ``major{''} males have
   head horns, whereas ``minor{''} males are hornless. Here we show that a
   switch in parental provisioning strategies adopted by males coincides
   with the switch in male morphology. Male provisioning results in the
   production of heavier brood masses than females will produce alone.
   However, unlike females in which the level of provisioning increases
   with body size in a continuous manner, the level of provisioning
   provided by males represents an ``all-or-none{''} tactic with all major
   males providing a Bred level of provisioning irrespective of their body
   size. Offspring size is determined largely by the quantity of dung
   provided to the developing larvae so that paternal and maternal
   provisioning affects the body size and horn size of offspring produced.
   The levels of provisioning by individual parents are significantly
   repeatable, suggesting paternal and maternal effects as candidate
   indirect genetic effects in the evolution of horn size in the genus
   Onthophagus.}},

Abstract = {{Timing of breeding and offspring size are maternal traits that may
   influence offspring competitive ability, dispersal, foraging, and
   vulnerability to predation and climatic conditions. To quantify the
   extent to which these maternal traits may ultimately affect an
   organism's fitness, we undertook laboratory and field experiments with
   Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). To control for confounding effects caused
   by correlated traits, manipulations of the timing of fertilization
   combined with intraclutch comparisons were used. In the wild, a total of
   1462 juveniles were marked at emergence from gravel nests. Recapture
   rates suggest that up to 83.5\% mortality occurred during the first four
   months after emergence from the gravel nests, with the majority (67.5\%)
   occurring during the initial period ending 17 days after median
   emergence. Moreover, the mortality was selective during this initial
   period, resulting in a significant phenotypic shift toward an earlier
   date of and an increased length at emergence. However, no significant
   selection differentials were detected thereafter, indicating that the
   critical episode of selection had occurred at emergence. Furthermore,
   standardized selection gradients indicated that selection was more
   intense on date of than on body size at emergence. Timing of emergence
   had additional consequences in terms of juvenile body size.
   Late-emerging juveniles were smaller than early-emerging ones at
   subsequent samplings, both in the wild and in parallel experiments
   conducted in seminatural stream channels, and this may affect success at
   subsequent size-selective episodes, such as winter mortality and
   reproduction. Finally, our findings also suggest that egg size had
   fitness consequences independent of the effects of emergence time that
   directly affected body size at emergence and, in turn, survival and size
   at later life stages. The causality of the maternal effects observed in
   the present study supports the hypothesis that selection on juvenile
   traits may play an important role in the evolution of maternal traits in
   natural populations.}},

   evolutionary theory by placing emphasis on the capacity of organisms to
   modify sources of natural selection in their environment (niche
   construction) and by broadening the evolutionary dynamic to incorporate
   ontogenic and cultural processes. In this model, phenotypes have a much
   more active role in evolution than generally conceived. This sheds light
   on hominid evolution, on the evolution of culture, and on altruism and
   cooperation. Culture amplifies the capacity of human beings to modify
   sources of natural selection in their environments to the point where
   that capacity raises some new questions about the processes of human

Abstract = {{A biallelic viability model based on human data for maternal-fetal
   interactions reported by Hedrick (1997) gives the interesting result of
   neutral stability at all gene frequencies. I show that there are two
   levels of selection, within and among families, acting in opposing
   directions in this model and that the neutral stability occurs when the
   two levels of selection exactly balance one another, as they do in a
   randomly mating population. Deviations from random mating disrupt the
   balance and consequently destroy the neutral stability. However, with
   inbreeding avoidance, which characterizes the human histocompatibility
   loci, within-family selection is strengthened and among-family selection
   is weakened. This favors the invasion of new alleles and contributes to
   a high equilibrium level of genetic diversity at loci with
   maternal-fetal interactions affecting offspring viability in the pattern
   described by Hedrick. This pattern of selection is remarkably similar to
   that observed for the maternal effect selfish genes, Medea in flour

Abstract = {{Maternal influences on progeny characters affect phenotypic correlations
   between characters expressed in maternal and progeny generations and
   consequently influence evolutionary responses to selection. Net
   selection on maternally influenced characters depends on selection birth
   on the progeny character and on the maternal characters that influence
   it. I used seed dispersal in Cakile edentula as a system in which to
   identify the mechanisms of environmentally mediated maternal effects and
   to determine how selection on maternal characters alters the adaptive
   value of dispersal. In C. edentula, maternal morphology responds to
   conspecific density experienced by the mother. Maternal morphology in
   turn affects offspring (seed) dispersal and density and thereby
   offspring morphology and fitness. I estimated the magnitude of
   density-mediated maternal effects on dispersal and identified their
   mechanism by characterizing the plasticity of maternal morphology to
   density. I also measured density-dependent selection on maternal
   characters that influence dispersal. Maternal plasticity to density was
   caused by both allometric and nonallometric variation in morphology, and
   this plasticity resulted in a negative correlation between maternal and
   progeny density. Such negative maternal effects are expected to retard
   responses to selection. Maternal morphology influenced maternal Fitness,
   in part through the relationship of fitness to maternal plant size and
   in part through size-independent fitness effects. Maternal phenotypes
   that promote dispersal, and thereby increase progeny fitness, were
   associated with decreased maternal fitness. Selection on dispersal at
   the level of progeny favors increased dispersal; maternal influences on
   dispersal, however, not only cause a greatly reduced adaptive value of
   dispersal but lead to the prediction of a slower response to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic models of maternal effects and models of mate choice have
   focused on the evolutionary effects of variation in parental quality.
   There have been, however, few attempts to combine these into a single
   model for the evolution of sexually selected traits. We present a
   quantitative genetic model that considers how male and female parental
   quality (together or separately) affect the expression of a sexually
   selected offspring trait. We allow female choice of males based on this
   parentally affected trait and examine the evolution of mate choice,
   parental quality and the indicator trait. Our model reveals a number of
   consequences of maternal and paternal effects. (1) The force of sexual
   selection owing to adaptive mate choice can displace parental quality
   from its natural selection optimum. (2) The force of sexual selection
   can displace female parental quality from its natural selection optimum
   even when nonadaptive mate choice occurs (e.g. runaway sexual
   selection), because females of higher parental quality produce more
   attractive sons and these sons counterbalance the loss in fitness owing
   to over-investment in each offspring. (3) Maternal and paternal effects
   can provide a source of genetic variation for offspring traits, allowing
   evolution by sexual selection even when those trails do not show direct
   genetic variation (i.e. are not heritable). (4) The correlation between
   paternal investment and the offspring trait influenced by the parental
   effects can result in adaptive mate choice and lead to the elaboration
   of both female preference and the male sexually selected trait. When
   parental effects exist, sexual selection can drive the evolution of
   parental quality when investment increases the attractiveness of
   offspring, leading to the elaboration of indicator traits and higher
   than expected levels of parental investment.}},

   correlated response in uterine and nurse maternal effects on body
   weights, with significant genetic-by-environment interactions.
   Significant uterine effects were also observed in tail length

Abstract = {{We investigated the genetic structure of a single island population of
   the dioecious plant Silene dioica in the Skeppsvik Archipelago, Umea,
   Sweden. The population is less than 10 years old and consists of
   approximately 700 individuals growing within an area of about 200 m(2).
   Despite the small scale of the study, levels of genetic differentiation
   among contiguous patches are greater than or comparable to what is
   observed over larger scales in the archipelago. The results suggest that
   the small-scale structuring occurs during population expansion, soon
   after island colonization, and that the observed patterns of genetic
   differentiation can be attributed to the population being substructured
   into family groups. This family structure results from kin-structured
   dispersal processes (colonization and migration) as the population
   expands over the island. As plant densities increase over time, either
   spatial fusion or temporal fusion of patches reduce the among patch
   variation. These processes, however, do not completely eradicate the
   genetic differentiation established by the kin-structured dispersal
   processes. We discuss some implications of kin structuring for evolution

Abstract = {{Social interactions often affect the fitness of interactants. Because of
   this, social selection has been described as a process distinct from
   other forms of natural selection. Social selection has been predicted to
   result in different evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes,
   including rapid or extreme evolution and evolution of altruism. Despite
   the critical role that social selection plays in theories of social
   evolution, few studies have measured the force of social selection or
   the conditions under which this force changes. Here we present a model
   of social selection acting on interacting phenotypes that can be
   evaluated independently from the genetics of interacting phenotypes. Our
   model of social selection is analogous to covariance model of other
   forms of selection. We observe that an opportunity for social selection
   exists whenever individual fitness varies as a result of interactions
   with conspecifics. Social selection occurs, therefore, when variation in
   fitness due to interactions covaries with traits, resulting in a net
   force of selection acting on the interacting phenotypes. Thus, there
   must be a covariance between the phenotypes of the interactants for
   social selection to exist. This interacting phenotype covariance is
   important because it measures the degree to which a particular trait
   covaries with the selective environment provided by conspecifics. A
   variety of factors, including nonrandom interactions, behavioral
   modification during interactions, relatedness, and indirect genetic
   effects may contribute to the covariance of interacting phenotypes,
   which promotes social selection. The independent force of social
   selection (measured as a social selection gradient) can be partitioned
   empirically from the force of natural selection (measured by the natural
   selection gradient) using partial regression. This measure can be
   combined with genetic models of interacting phenotypes to provide
   insights into social evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions experienced during ontogeny may have important
   and permanent consequences for life-history traits of individuals. The
   aim of this work was to determine whether conditions experienced during
   early life, as expressed by prefledglng condition, have any bearing on
   the volume of eggs subsequently laid by females in a small passerine
   bird species, the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca). I first show a
   genetic influence on egg volume by dam-offspring regression. The
   existence of maternal effects is shown by comparing resemblances between
   average egg volumes of offspring to those of their paternal and maternal
   grandmothers. Path analysis shows that when controlling for the
   influence of maternal egg volume, the average volume of eggs produced in
   a lifetime is positively related to the body condition of a female
   measured while she is still at the nest. Thus, body condition at
   fledgling affects egg volume beyond the ability of maternal egg volume
   to predict offspring egg volume. Although there may be a persistent
   maternal effect of egg volume on itself or linked to a property
   correlated with egg volume, the maternal performance trait involved
   remains unknown, except for maternal egg volume itself. Given the
   effects that egg volume may have on reproductive success, which are
   partly determined prior to leaving the nest, maternal effects may have
   important consequences for lifetime fitness of offspring.}},

Abstract = {{The course and outcome of biological evolution is strongly influenced by
   constraints. They, flanking the work of natural selection, operate not
   only by limiting but also by changing the evolutionary processes. The
   following constraint categories are discussed and analyzed: structural
   developmental, phylogenetic, genetic, epigenetic, behavioural,
   ecological (as ecosystemic) and selective. Epigenetic, behavioural and
   ecosystemic constraints may be important ways through which an
   environmental information, supplementary to that conveyed by natural
   selection, can flow in the evolutionary process influencing the
   phenotype construction. The different constraint categories depend on
   three basic evolutionary forces: structure, environment and history or
   contingency. They form a network of reciprocal dependences and interact
   with natural selection. In the newly proposed two-step evolutionary
   model (Sara {[}1993]), in which two phases alternate at each generation,
   the constructive, organismic phase is represented by constraints (except
   the selective ones) while the selective, populational phase is
   represented by natural selection and selective constraints as drift.}},

Abstract = {{A central issue in evolutionary biology is the extent to which complex
   social organization is under genetic control. We have found that a
   single genomic element marked by the protein-encoding gene Gp-9 is
   responsible for the existence of two distinct farms of social
   organization in the fire ant Solenopsis invicta. This genetic factor
   influences the reproductive phenotypes and behavioral strategies of
   queens and determines whether workers tolerate a single fertile queen or
   multiple queens per colony. Furthermore, this factor affects worker
   tolerance of queens with alternate genotypes, thus explaining the
   dramatic differences in Gp-9 allele frequencies observed between the two
   social forms in the wild. These findings reveal how a single genetic
   factor can hare major effects on complex social behavior and influence
   the nature of social organization.}},

   With maternal selection, genetic variability can be maintained in the

Abstract = {{Parents often have important influences on their offspring's traits
   and/or fitness (i.e., maternal or paternal effects). When offspring
   fitness is determined by the joint influences of offspring and parental
   traits, selection may favor particular combinations that generate high
   offspring fitness. We show that this epistasis for fitness between the
   parental and offspring genotypes can result in the evolution of their
   joint distribution, generating genetic correlations between the parental
   and offspring characters. This phenomenon can be viewed as a coadaptive
   process in which offspring genotypes evolve to function with the
   parentally provided environment and, in turn, the genes for this
   environment become associated with specific offspring genes adapted to
   it. To illustrate this point, we present two scenarios in which
   selection on offspring alone alters the correlation between a maternal
   and an offspring character. We use a quantitative genetic maternal
   effect model combined with a simple quadratic model of fitness to
   examine changes in the linkage disequilibrium between the maternal and
   offspring genotypes. In the first scenario, stabilizing selection on a
   maternally affected offspring character results in a genetic correlation
   that is opposite in sign to the maternal effect. In the second scenario,
   directional selection on an offspring trait that shows a nonadditive
   maternal effect can result in selection for positive covariances between
   the traits. This form of selection also results in increased genetic
   variation in maternal and offspring characters, and may, in the extreme
   case, promote host-race formation or speciation. This model provides a
   possible evolutionary explanation for the ubiquity of large genetic
   correlations between maternal and offspring traits, and suggests that
   this pattern of coinheritance may reflect functional relationships
   between these characters (i.e., functional integration).}},

Title = {{Whole-genome re-sequencing association study for direct genetic effects
   and social genetic effects of six growth traits in Large White pigs}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Socially affected traits are affected by direct genetic effects (DGE)
   and social genetic effects (SGE). DGE and SGE of an individual directly
   quantify the genetic influence of its own phenotypes and the phenotypes
   of other individuals, respectively. In the current study, a total of
   3,276 Large White pigs from different pens were used, and each pen
   contained 10 piglets. DGE and SGE were estimated for six socially
   affected traits, and then a GWAS was conducted to identify SNPs
   associated with DGE and SGE. Based on the whole-genome re-sequencing, 40
   Large White pigs were genotyped and 10,501,384 high quality SNPs were
   retained for single-locus and multi-locus GWAS. For single-locus GWAS, a
   total of 54 SNPs associated with DGE and 33 SNPs with SGE exceeded the
   threshold (P < 5.00E-07) were detected for six growth traits. Of these,
   22 SNPs with pleiotropic effects were shared by DGE and SGE. For
   multi-locus GWAS, a total of 72 and 110 putative QTNs were detected for
   DGE and SGE, respectively. Of these, 5 SNPs with pleiotropic effects
   were shared by DGE and SGE. It is noteworthy that 2 SNPs (SSC8: 16438396
   for DGE and SSC17: 9697454 for SGE) were detected in single-locus and
   multi-locus GWAS. Furthermore, 15 positional candidate genes shared by
   SGE and DGE were identified because of their roles in behaviour, health
   and disease. Identification of genetic variants and candidate genes for
   DGE and SGE for socially affected traits will provide a new insight to
   understand the genetic architecture of socially affected traits in pigs.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms can affect one another's phenotypes when they socially
   interact. Indirect genetic effects occur when an individual's phenotype
   is affected by genes expressed in another individual. These heritable
   effects can enhance or reduce adaptive potential, thereby accelerating
   or reversing evolutionary change. Quantifying these social effects is
   therefore crucial for our understanding of evolution, yet estimates of
   indirect genetic effects in wild animals are limited to dyadic
   interactions. We estimated indirect phenotypic and genetic effects, and
   their covariance with direct effects, for the date of spring breeding in
   North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) living in an
   array of territories of varying spatial proximity. Additionally, we
   estimated indirect effects and the strength of selection at low and high
   population densities. Social effects of neighbours on the date of spring
   breeding were different from zero at high population densities but not
   at low population densities. Indirect phenotypic effects accounted for a
   larger amount of variation in the date of breeding than differences
   attributable to the among-individual variance, suggesting social
   interactions are important for determining breeding dates. The genetic
   component to these indirect effects was however not statistically
   significant. We therefore showcase a powerful and flexible method that
   will allow researchers working in organisms with a range of social
   systems to estimate indirect phenotypic and genetic effects, and
   demonstrate the degree to which social interactions can influence
   phenotypes, even in a solitary species.}},

Volume = {{122}},

Abstract = {{Infectious diseases have a huge impact on animal health, production and
   welfare, and human health. Understanding the role of host genetics in
   disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies
   that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While
   heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in
   livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional
   genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of
   including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A
   Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating
   polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was
   combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the
   non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic
   risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was
   calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing
   in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both
   traits, 50\% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to
   reduce the basic reproductive number R-0 from 7.64 to the critical
   threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in
   the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R-0 < 1, to 3
   generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on
   susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain
   from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and
   reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates
   delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host
   infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future
   genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence
   and impact of epidemics.}},

Abstract = {{We generally expect traits to evolve in the same direction as selection.
   However, many organisms possess traits that appear to be costly for
   individuals, while plant and animal breeding experiments reveal that
   selection may lead to no response or even negative responses to
   selection. We formalize both of these instances as cases of ``opposite
   responses to selection.{''} Using quantitative genetic models for the
   response to selection, we outline when opposite responses to selection
   should be expected. These typically occur when social selection opposes
   direct selection, when individuals interact with others less related to
   them than a random member of the population, and if the genetic
   covariance between direct and indirect effects is negative. We discuss
   the likelihood of each of these occurring in nature and therefore
   summarize how frequent opposite responses to selection are likely to be.
   This links several evolutionary phenomena within a single framework.}},

Abstract = {{The social structure of populations plays a key role in shaping
   variation in sexual selection. In nature, sexual selection occurs in
   communities of interacting species; however, heterospecifics are rarely
   included in characterizations of social structure. Heterospecifics can
   influence the reproductive outcomes of intrasexual competition by
   interfering with intraspecific sexual interactions (interspecific
   reproductive interference {[}IRI]). We outline the need for studies of
   sexual selection to incorporate heterospecifics as part of the social
   environment. We use simulations to show that classic predictions for the
   effect of social structure on sexual selection are altered by an
   interaction between social structure and IRI. This interaction has
   wide-ranging implications for patterns of sexual conflict and
   kin-selected reproductive strategies in socially structured populations.
   Our work bridges the gap between sexual selection research on social
   structure and IRI, and highlights future directions to study sexual
   selection in interacting communities.}},

Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{Since group-living animals are embedded in a network of social
   interactions, socioecological factors may not only affect individual
   behavioral strategies but also the patterning of group-level social
   interactions, i.e., the network structure. These co-variations between
   socioecological factors, individual behavior, and group-level structure
   are important to study since ecological factors may strongly influence
   animal health outcomes and reproductive success. Besides factors such as
   social information and/or infectious agents, with far-reaching
   individual fitness consequences, seem independent of individuals' own
   social interactions but directly affected by the topology of the social
   network. This paper reviews how socio-ecological pressures, i.e., causal
   factors (food distribution, predation, and infectious agent risk), via
   intermediary mechanisms (stress, information sharing, and mating
   system), may affect individual social behavior and consequently, social
   network topology. We also discuss how evolutionary driving forces,
   genetic (i.e., genes) and cultural (i.e., learned behavior) selection,
   may result in a specific composition of individuals' social strategies
   that produce network topologies that might be optimized to specific
   socio-ecological conditions. We conclude that studies focusing on
   whether and how well networks resist changing conditions might provide a
   better understanding of the rules underlying individual behavior, which
   in turn influences network topologya process we have called network
   evolution. Evolutionary processes may favor a group phenotypic
   composition, thus a network topology. This has been referred to as a
   ``collective social niche construction{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Despite serving the primary objective of ensuring that at least one
   sperm cell reaches and fertilises an ovum, the male ejaculate (i.e.
   spermatozoa and seminal fluid) is a compositionally complex `trait' that
   can respond phenotypically to subtle changes in conditions. In
   particular, recent research has shown that environmentally and
   genetically induced changes to ejaculates can have implications for
   offspring traits that are independent of the DNA sequence encoded into
   the sperm's haploid genome. In this review, we compile evidence from
   several disciplines and numerous taxonomic systems to reveal the extent
   of such ejaculate-mediated paternal effects (EMPEs). We consider a
   number of environmental and genetic factors that have been shown to
   impact offspring phenotypes via ejaculates, and where possible, we
   highlight the putative mechanistic pathways by which ejaculates can act
   as conduits for paternal effects. We also highlight how females
   themselves can influence EMPEs, and in some cases, how maternally
   derived sources of variance may confound attempts to test for EMPEs.
   Finally, we consider a range of putative evolutionary implications of
   EMPEs and suggest a number of potentially useful approaches for
   exploring these further. Overall, our review confirms that EMPEs are
   both widespread and varied in their effects, although studies reporting
   their evolutionary effects are still in their infancy.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions can give rise to indirect genetic effects (IGEs),
   which occur when genes expressed in one individual affect the phenotype
   of another individual. The evolutionary dynamics of traits can be
   altered when there are IGEs. Sex often involves indirect effects arising
   from first-order (current) or second-order (prior) social interactions,
   yet IGEs are infrequently quantified for reproductive behaviors. Here,
   we use experimental populations of burying beetles that have experienced
   bidirectional selection on mating rate to test for social plasticity and
   IGEs associated with focal males mating with a female either without
   (first-order effect) or with (second-order effect) prior exposure to a
   competitor, and resource defense behavior (first-order effect). Additive
   IGEs were detected for mating rate arising from (first-order)
   interactions with females. For resource defense behavior, a standard
   variance partitioning analysis provided no evidence of additive genetic
   varianceeither direct or indirect. However, behavior was predicted by
   focal size relative to that of the competitor, and size is also
   heritable. Assuming that behavior is causally dependent on relative
   size, this implies that both DGEs and IGEs do occur (and may potentially
   interact). The relative contribution of IGEs may differ among social
   behaviors related to mating which has consequences for the evolutionary
   trajectories of multivariate traits.}},

Abstract = {{There are many situations in nature where we expect traits to evolve but
   not necessarily for mean fitness to increase. However, these scenarios
   are hard to reconcile simultaneously with Fisher's fundamental theorem
   of natural selection (FTNS) and the Price identity (PI). The
   consideration of indirect genetic effects (IGEs) on fitness reconciles
   these fundamental theorems with the observation that traits sometimes
   evolve without any adaptation by explicitly considering the correlated
   evolution of the social environment, which is a form of transmission
   bias. Although environmental change is often assumed to be absent when
   using the PI, here we show that explicitly considering IGEs as change in
   the social environment with implications for fitness has several
   benefits: (1) it makes clear how traits can evolve while mean fitness
   remains stationary, (2) it reconciles the FTNS with the evolution of
   maladaptation, (3) it explicitly includes density-dependent fitness
   through negative social effects that depend on the number of interacting
   conspecifics, and (4) it allows mean fitness to evolve even when direct
   genetic variance in fitness is zero, if related individuals interact
   and/or if there is multilevel selection. In summary, considering fitness
   in the context of IGEs aligns important theorems of natural selection
   with many situations observed in nature and provides a useful lens
   through which we might better understand evolution and adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Parental care is found widely across animal taxa and is manifest in a
   range of behaviours from basic provisioning in cockroaches to highly
   complex behaviours seen in mammals. The evolution of parental care is
   viewed as the outcome of an evolutionary cost/benefit trade-off between
   investing in current and future offspring, leading to the selection of
   traits in offspring that influence parental behaviour. Thus, level and
   quality of parental care are affected by both parental and offspring
   genetic differences that directly and indirectly influence parental care
   behaviour. While significant research effort has gone into understanding
   how parental genomes affect parental, and mostly maternal, behaviour,
   few studies have investigated how offspring genomes affect parental
   care. In this review, we bring together recent findings across different
   fields focussing on the mechanism and genetics of offspring effects on
   maternal care in mammals.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of aggression depends not only on the direct genetic
   effects (DGEs) of an individual's genes on its own behavior, but also on
   indirect genetic effects (IGEs) caused by heritable phenotypes expressed
   by social partners. IGEs can affect the amount of heritable variance on
   which selection can act. Despite the important roles of IGEs in the
   evolutionary process, it remains largely unknown whether the strength of
   IGEs varies across life stages or competitive regimes. Based on
   manipulations of nymphal densities and > 3000 pair-wise aggression tests
   across multiple life stages, we experimentally demonstrate that IGEs on
   aggression are stronger in field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) that
   develop at lower densities than in those that develop at higher
   densities, and that these effects persist with age. The existence of
   density-dependent IGEs implies that social interactions strongly
   determine the plastic expression of aggression when competition for
   resources is relaxed. A more competitive (higher density) rearing
   environment may fail to provide crickets with sufficient resources to
   develop social cognition required for strong IGEs. The contribution of
   IGEs to evolutionary responses was greater at lower densities. Our study
   thereby demonstrates the importance of considering IGEs in
   density-dependent ecological and evolutionary processes.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The genetic effects of an individual on the phenotypes of its
   social partners, such as its pen mates, are known as social genetic
   effects. This study aims to identify the candidate genes for social
   (pen-mates') average daily gain (ADG) in pigs by using the genome-wide
   association approach.
   Methods: Social ADG (sADG) was the average ADG of unrelated pen-mates
   (strangers). We used the phenotype data (16,802 records) after
   correcting for batch (week), sex, pen, number of strangers (1 to 7 pigs)
   in the pen, full-sib rate (0\% to 80\%) within pen, and age at the end
   of the test. A total of 1,041 pigs from Landrace breeds were genotyped
   using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 v2 BeadChip panel, which comprised
   61,565 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. After quality
   control, 909 individuals and 39,837 markers remained for sADG in
   genome-wide association study.
   Results: We detected five new SNPs, all on chromosome 6, which have not
   been associated with social ADG or other growth traits to date. One SNP
   was inside the prostaglandin F2 alpha receptor (PTGFR) gene, another SNP
   was located 22 kb upstream of gene interferon-induced protein 44
   (IFI44), and the last three SNPs were between 161 kb and 191 kb upstream
   of the EGF latrophilin and seven transmembrane domain-containing protein
   1 (ELTD1) gene. PTGFR, IFI44, and ELTD1 were never associated with
   social interaction and social genetic effects in any of the previous
   studies.
   Conclusion: The identification of several genomic regions, and candidate
   genes associated with social genetic effects reported here, could
   contribute to a better understanding of the genetic basis of interaction
   traits for ADG. In conclusion, we suggest that the PTGFR, IFI44, and
   ELTD1 may be used as a molecular marker for sADG, although their
   functional effect was not defined yet. Thus, it will be of interest to
   execute association studies in those genes.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Indirect genetic effects (IGE) are important components of
   various traits in several species Although the intensity of social
   interactions between partners likely vary over time, very few genetic
   studies have investigated how IGE vary over time for traits under
   selection in livestock species To overcome this issue, our aim was (1)
   to analyze longitudinal records of average daily gain (ADG) in rabbits
   subjected to a 5-week period of feed restriction using a structured
   antedependence (SAD) model that includes IGE and (2) to evaluate, by
   simulation, the response to selection when IGE are present and genetic
   evaluation is based on a SAD model that includes IGE or not.
   Results: The direct genetic variance for ADG (g/d) increased from week 1
   to 3 {[}from 8.03 to 13.47 (g/d)(2)] and then decreased {[}6.20 (g/d)(2)
   at week 5], while the indirect genetic variance decreased from week 1 to
   4 {[}from 0.43 to 0.22 (g/d)(2)] The correlation between the direct
   genetic effects of different weeks was moderate to high (ranging from
   0.46 to 0.86) and tended to decrease with time interval between
   measurements The same trend was observed for IGE for weeks 2 to 5
   (correlations ranging from 0.62 to 0.91) Estimates of the correlation
   between IGE of week 1 and IGE of the other weeks did not follow the same
   pattern and correlations were lower Estimates of correlations between
   direct and indirect effects were negative at all times After seven
   generations of simulated selection, the increase in ADG I from selection
   on EBV from a SAD model that included IGE was higher (similar to 30\%)
   than when those effects were omitted.
   Conclusions: Indirect genetic effects are larger just after mixing
   animals at weaning than later in the fattening I period, probably
   because of the establishment of social hierarchy that is generally
   observed at that time Accounting for IGE in the selection criterion
   maximizes genetic progress.}},

Abstract = {{What was once expensive and revolutionary full-genome sequenceis now
   affordable and routine. Costs will continue to drop, opening up new
   frontiers in behavioral genetics. This shift in costs from the genome to
   the phenome is most notable in large clinical studies of behavior and
   associated diseases in cohorts that exceed hundreds of thousands of
   subjects. Examples include the Women's Health Initiative (www.whl.org),
   the Million Veterans Program (www.research.va.gov/MVP), the 100000
   Genomes Project (genomicsengland.co.uk) and commercial efforts such as
   those by deCode (www.decode.com) and 23 and me (www.23andme.com). The
   same transition is happening in experimental neuro- and behavioral
   genetics, and sample sizes of many hundreds of cases are becoming
   routine (www.genenetwork.org, www.mousephenotyping.org). There are two
   major consequences of this new affordability of massive omics datasets:
   (1) it is now far more practical to explore genetic modulation of
   behavioral differences and the key role of gene-by-environment
   interactions. Researchers are already doing the hard part the
   quantitative analysis of behavior. Adding the omics component can
   provide powerful links to molecules, cells, circuits and even better
   treatment. (2) There is an acute need to highlight and train behavioral
   scientists in how best to exploit new omics approaches. This review
   addresses this second issue and highlights several new trends and
   opportunities that will be of interest to experts in animal and human
   behaviors.}},

Title = {{Pervasive indirect genetic effects on behavioral development in
   polymorphic eastern mosquitofish}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{289-300}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{``Nurture{''} depends on the ``nature{''} of social partners. The
   behavior of a young male mosquitofish depends on genetic differences in
   his social partners and on his own genes. Social partners that are
   genetically dark or light colored affect the behavior differently. But,
   dark-colored males respond less to social differences than light males,
   and receive different behaviors from social partners. So, even
   apparently innate differences related to color can be caused by
   differences in the behavior of social partners.The social environment
   can dramatically influence the development and expression of individual
   behavior. Indirect genetic effects (IGE) arise when variation in the
   social environment depends on genotypic differences among social
   partners. Their role in generating variation and influencing
   evolutionary dynamics has become increasingly recognized in recent
   years, but less attention has been paid to how IGE arise during
   development. We measured the development of IGE using a discrete natural
   polymorphism in male coloration and associated behaviors in eastern
   mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). We observed substantial IGE and
   direct genetic effects on behavior. For some behaviors, IGE changed and
   even reversed direction over the 16 weeks of the experiment, indicating
   important developmental dynamics. Interaction between IGE and direct
   genetic effects for some behaviors suggests that melanistic males were
   less responsive to a genetic change in their social environment than
   nonmelanistic males were. Alternately, social partners might vary less
   in the behavior they direct toward melanistic males. Color morphs
   differed in mating behavior and in aggressive behavior they received
   from social partners, but not in direct measures of aggression.
   Therefore, even apparently innate differences in behavior between morphs
   could arise as indirect effects of differences in behavior directed
   toward them by social partners. These results indicate that some
   differences attributed to melanism in this and other species might
   result from color morphs experiencing different social environments.
   Deducing the developmental and social origins of these indirect effects
   is therefore critical for understanding melanism-associated behavioral
   variation in the many species in which it occurs.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms express phenotypic plasticity during social interactions.
   Interacting phenotype theory has explored the consequences of social
   plasticity for evolution, but it is unclear how this theory applies to
   complex social structures. We adapt interacting phenotype models to
   general social structures to explore how the number of social
   connections between individuals and preference for phenotypically
   similar social partners affect phenotypic variation and evolution. We
   derive an analytical model that ignores phenotypic feedback and use
   simulations to test the predictions of this model. We find that adapting
   previous models to more general social structures does not alter their
   general conclusions but generates insights into the effect of social
   plasticity and social structure on the maintenance of phenotypic
   variation and evolution. Contribution of indirect genetic effects to
   phenotypic variance is highest when interactions occur at intermediate
   densities and decrease at higher densities, when individuals approach
   interacting with all group members, homogenizing the social environment
   across individuals. However, evolutionary response to selection tends to
   increase at greater network densities as the effects of an individual's
   genes are amplified through increasing effects on other group members.
   Preferential associations among similar individuals (homophily) increase
   both phenotypic variance within groups and evolutionary response to
   selection. Our results represent a first step in relating social network
   structure to the expression of social plasticity and evolutionary
   responses to selection.}},

Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{Competition for resources including food, physical space, and potential
   mates is a fundamental ecological process shaping variation in
   individual phenotype and fitness. The evolution of competitive ability,
   in particular social dominance, depends on genetic (co)variation among
   traits causal (e.g., behavior) or consequent (e.g., growth) to
   competitive outcomes. If dominance is heritable, it will generate both
   direct and indirect genetic effects (IGE) on resource-dependent traits.
   The latter are expected to impose evolutionary constraint because
   winners necessarily gain resources at the expense of losers. We varied
   competition in a population of sheepshead swordtails, Xiphophorus
   birchmanni, to investigate effects on behavior, size, growth, and
   survival. We then applied quantitative genetic analyses to determine (i)
   whether competition leads to phenotypic and/or genetic integration of
   behavior with life history and (ii) the potential for IGE to constrain
   life history evolution. Size, growth, and survival were reduced at high
   competition. Male dominance was repeatable and dominant individuals show
   higher growth and survival. Additive genetic contributions to phenotypic
   covariance were significant, with the G matrix largely recapitulating
   phenotypic relationships. Social dominance has a low but significant
   heritability and is strongly genetically correlated with size and
   growth. Assuming causal dependence of growth on dominance, hidden IGE
   will therefore reduce evolutionary potential.}},

Title = {{An evolutionary framework outlining the integration of individual social

Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{113-127}},

Abstract = {{1. Behaviour is the interface between an organism and its environment,
   and behavioural plasticity is important for organisms to cope with
   environmental change. Social behaviour is particularly important because
   sociality is a dynamic process, where environmental variation influences
   group dynamics and social plasticity can mediate resource acquisition.
   Heterogeneity in the ecological environment can therefore influence the
   social environment. The combination of the ecological and social
   environments may be interpreted collectively as the socioecological
   environment, which could explain variation in fitness.
   2. Our objective was to outline a framework through which individual
   social and spatial phenotypes can be integrated and interpreted as
   phenotypes that covary as a function of changes in the socioecological
   environment. We propose the socioecological environment is composed of
   individual behavioural traits, including sociality and habitat
   selection, both of which are repeatable, potentially heritable and may
   reflect animal personality traits. We also highlight how ecological and
   social niche theory can be applied to the socioecological environment
   framework, where individuals occupy different socioecological niches.
   Individual sociality and habitat selection are also density-dependent,
   and theory predicts that density-dependent traits should affect
   reproduction, survival, and therefore fitness and population dynamics.
   3. We then illustrate the proximate links between sociality, habitat
   selection and fitness as well as the ultimate, and possibly adaptive,
   consequences associated with changes in population density. The
   ecological, evolutionary and applied implications of our proposed
   socioecological environment framework are broad and changes in density
   could influence individual fitness and population dynamics. For
   instance, human-induced environmental changes can influence population
   density, which can affect the distribution of social and spatial
   phenotypes within a population. In summary, we outline a conceptual
   framework that incorporates individual social and spatial behavioural
   traits with fitness and we highlight a range of ecological and
   evolutionary processes that are likely associated with the
   socioecological environment.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment is both an important agent of selection for most
   organisms, and an emergent property of their interactions. As an
   aggregation of interactions among members of a population, the social
   environment is a product of many sets of relationships and so can be
   represented as a network or matrix. Social network analysis in animals
   has focused on why these networks possess the structure they do, and
   whether individuals' network traits, representing some aspect of their
   social phenotype, relate to their fitness. Meanwhile, quantitative
   geneticists have demonstrated that traits expressed in a social context
   can depend on the phenotypes and genotypes of interacting partners,
   leading to influences of the social environment on the traits and
   fitness of individuals and the evolutionary trajectories of populations.
   Therefore, both fields are investigating similar topics, yet have
   arrived at these points relatively independently. We review how these
   approaches are diverged, and yet how they retain clear parallelism and
   so strong potential for complementarity. This demonstrates that, despite
   separate bodies of theory, advances in one might inform the other.
   Techniques in network analysis for quantifying social phenotypes, and
   for identifying community structure, should be useful for those studying
   the relationship between individual behaviour and group-level
   phenotypes. Entering social association matrices into quantitative
   genetic models may also reduce bias in heritability estimates, and allow
   the estimation of the influence of social connectedness on trait
   expression. Current methods for measuring natural selection in a social
   context explicitly account for the fact that a trait is not necessarily
   the property of a single individual, something the network approaches
   have not yet considered when relating network metrics to individual
   fitness. Harnessing evolutionary models that consider traits affected by
   genes in other individuals (i.e. indirect genetic effects) provides the
   potential to understand how entire networks of social interactions in
   populations influence phenotypes and predict how these traits may
   evolve. By theoretical integration of social network analysis and
   quantitative genetics, we hope to identify areas of compatibility and
   incompatibility and to direct research efforts towards the most
   promising areas. Continuing this synthesis could provide important
   insights into the evolution of traits expressed in a social context and
   the evolutionary consequences of complex and nuanced social phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{A central problem in evolutionary biology is to determine whether and
   how social interactions contribute to natural selection. A key method
   for phenotypic data is social selection analysis, in which fitness
   effects from social partners contribute to selection only when there is
   a correlation between the traits of individuals and their social
   partners (nonrandom phenotypic assortment). However, there are
   inconsistencies in the use of social selection that center around the
   measurement of phenotypic assortment. Here, we use data analysis and
   simulations to resolve these inconsistencies, showing that: (i) not all
   measures of assortment are suitable for social selection analysis; and
   (ii) the interpretation of assortment, and how to detect nonrandom
   assortment, will depend on the scale at which it is measured. We discuss
   links to kin selection theory and provide a practical guide for the
   social selection approach.}},

Abstract = {{Despite essential progress towards understanding the evolution of
   cooperative behaviour, we still lack detailed knowledge about its
   underlying molecular mechanisms, genetic basis, evolutionary dynamics
   and ontogeny. An international workshop ``Genetics and Development of
   Cooperation,{''} organized by the University of Bern (Switzerland),
   aimed at discussing the current progress in this research field and
   suggesting avenues for future research. This review uses the major
   themes of the meeting as a springboard to synthesize the concepts of
   genetic and nongenetic inheritance of cooperation, and to review a
   quantitative genetic framework that allows for the inclusion of indirect
   genetic effects. Furthermore, we argue that including nongenetic
   inheritance, such as transgenerational epigenetic effects, parental
   effects, ecological and cultural inheritance, provides a more nuanced
   view of the evolution of cooperation. We summarize those genes and
   molecular pathways in a range of species that seem promising candidates
   for mechanisms underlying cooperative behaviours. Concerning the
   neurobiological substrate of cooperation, we suggest three cognitive
   skills necessary for the ability to cooperate: (i) event memory, (ii)
   synchrony with others and (iii) responsiveness to others. Taking a
   closer look at the developmental trajectories that lead to the
   expression of cooperative behaviours, we discuss the dichotomy between
   early morphological specialization in social insects and more flexible
   behavioural specialization in cooperatively breeding vertebrates.
   Finally, we provide recommendations for which biological systems and
   species may be particularly suitable, which specific traits and
   parameters should be measured, what type of approaches should be
   followed, and which methods should be employed in studies of cooperation
   to better understand how cooperation evolves and manifests in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Classical models of evolution seldom predict the rate at which
   populations evolve in the wild. One explanation is that the social
   environment affects how traits change in response to natural selection.
   Here we determine how social interactions between parents and offspring,
   and among lareae, influence the response to experimental selection on
   adult size. Our experiments focus on burying beetles (Nicrophorus
   vespilloides), whose larvae develop within a carrion nest. Some broods
   exclusively self-feed on the carrion, while others are also fed by their
   parents. We found that populations responded to selection for larger
   adults, but only when parents cared for their offspring. We also found
   that populations responded to selection for smaller adults, but only by
   removing parents and causing larvae interactions to exert more influence
   on eventual adult size. Comparative analyses revealed a similar pattern:
   evolutionary increases in species size within the genus Nicrophorus are
   associated with the obligate provision of care. Combining our results
   with previous studies, we suggest that cooperative social environments
   enhance the response to selection, whereas excessive conflict can
   prevent a response to further directional selection.}},

Abstract = {{Individuals often interact more closely with some members of the
   population (e.g., offspring, siblings, or group members) than they do
   with other individuals. This structuring of interactions can lead to
   multilevel natural selection, where traits expressed at the group-level
   influence fitness alongside individual-level traits. Such multilevel
   selection can alter evolutionary trajectories, yet is rarely quantified
   in the wild, especially for species that do not interact in clearly
   demarcated groups. We quantified multilevel natural selection on two
   traits, postnatal growth rate and birth date, in a population of North
   American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). The strongest level of
   selection was typically within-acoustic social neighborhoods (within 130
   m of the nest), where growing faster and being born earlier than nearby
   litters was key, while selection on growth rate was also apparent both
   within-litters and within-study areas. Higher population densities
   increased the strength of selection for earlier breeding, but did not
   influence selection on growth rates. Females experienced especially
   strong selection on growth rate at the within-litter level, possibly
   linked to the biased bequeathal of the maternal territory to daughters.
   Our results demonstrate the importance of considering multilevel and
   sex-specific selection in wild species, including those that are
   territorial and sexually monomorphic.}},

Abstract = {{Genotype by genotype indirect genetic effects (G x G IGEs) occur when
   the phenotype of an individual is influenced by an interaction between
   its own genotype and those of neighbour individuals. Little is known
   regarding the relative importance of G x G IGEs compared with other
   forms of direct and indirect genetic effects. We quantified the relative
   importance of IGEs in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, a
   species in which IGEs are likely to be important as air-borne social
   interactions are known to affect growth. We used a collection of
   distantly related wild isolates, lab strains and a set of closely
   related mutation accumulation lines to estimate the contribution of
   direct and indirect genetic effects on mycelium growth rate, a key
   fitness component. We found that indirect genetic effects were dominated
   by Gx G IGEs that occurred primarily between a focal genotype and its
   immediate neighbour within a vertical stack, and these accounted for
   11\% of phenotypic variation. These results indicate that G x G IGEs may
   be substantial, at least in some systems, and that the evolutionary
   importance of these interactions may be underappreciated, especially in
   microbes. We advocate for a wider use of the IGE framework in both
   applied (for example, choice of varietal mixtures in plant breeding) and
   evolutionary genetics (kin selection/kin competition studies).}},

Title = {{A model to estimate effects of SNPs on host susceptibility and
   infectivity for an endemic infectious disease}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{Background: Infectious diseases in farm animals affect animal health,
   decrease animal welfare and can affect human health. Selection and
   breeding of host individuals with desirable traits regarding infectious
   diseases can help to fight disease transmission, which is affected by
   two types of (genetic) traits: host susceptibility and host infectivity.
   Quantitative genetic studies on infectious diseases generally connect an
   individual's disease status to its own genotype, and therefore capture
   genetic effects on susceptibility only. However, they usually ignore
   variation in exposure to infectious herd mates, which may limit the
   accuracy of estimates of genetic effects on susceptibility. Moreover,
   genetic effects on infectivity will exist as well. Thus, to design
   optimal breeding strategies, it is essential that genetic effects on
   infectivity are quantified. Given the potential importance of genetic
   effects on infectivity, we set out to develop a model to estimate the
   effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on both host
   susceptibility and host infectivity. To evaluate the quality of the
   resulting SNP effect estimates, we simulated an endemic disease in 10
   groups of 100 individuals, and recorded time-series data on individual
   disease status. We quantified bias and precision of the estimates for
   different sizes of SNP effects, and identified the optimum recording
   interval when the number of records is limited.
   Results: We present a generalized linear mixed model to estimate the
   effect of SNPs on both host susceptibility and host infectivity. SNP
   effects were on average slightly underestimated, i. e. estimates were
   conservative. Estimates were less precise for infectivity than for
   susceptibility. Given our sample size, the power to estimate SNP effects
   for susceptibility was 100\% for differences between genotypes of a
   factor 1.56 or more, and was higher than 60\% for infectivity for
   differences between genotypes of a factor 4 or more. When disease status
   was recorded 11 times on each animal, the optimal recording interval was
   25 to 50\% of the average infectious period.
   Conclusions: Our model was able to estimate genetic effects on
   susceptibility and infectivity. In future genomewide association
   studies, it may serve as a starting point to identify genes that affect
   disease transmission and disease prevalence.}},

Title = {{Interpreting selection when individuals interact}},
Journal = {{METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. A useful interpretation of quantitative genetic models of
   evolutionary change is that they (i) define a set of phenotypes that
   have a causal effect on fitness and on which selection acts, and (ii)
   define a set of breeding values that change as a correlated response to
   that selection because they covary with the phenotypes.
   2. When the expression of one trait causes variation in other traits
   then there are multiple paths by which a trait can cause fitness
   variation. Because of this, there are multiple ways in which selection
   can be defined, and still be consistent with a causal effect of traits
   on fitness.
   3. We use this result to show that genetical theories of natural/kin
   selection ignore causation and because of this we suggest they shed
   little light on the nature of selection.
   4. When traits expressed by an individual are affected by traits of
   their social partners (indirect genetic effects), we suggest a causal
   partitioning that allows selection to be cast in terms of Hamilton's
   costs and benefits.
   5. We show that previous attempts to understand Hamilton's rule in the
   context of indirect genetic effects either lack generality, or do not
   adequately describe all the ways in which an individual's actions
   constitute a cost to the individual or a benefit to its social
   partner(s).
   6. Our results allow us to explore Hamilton's rule in a multitrait
   setting. We show that evolution always increases inclusive fitness, and
   when the traits are measured in units of generalised genetic distance
   evolutionary change in the traits is in the direction in which inclusive
   fitness increases the fastest.
   7. However, we show that Hamilton's rule only holds in a multitrait
   context when the suite of traits are at equilibrium. When they are out
   of equilibrium, the conditions for altruism to evolve may be more or
   less stringent depending on genetic architecture and how costs and
   benefits are defined.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are abundant, both in natural and
   domestic populations, and may affect phenotypes of individuals. Recent
   research has demonstrated that the social effect of an individual on the
   phenotype of its social partners may have a genetic component, known as
   an indirect genetic effect (IGE). Little is known, however, of
   nongenetic factors underlying such social effects. Early-life
   environments often have large effects on phenotypes of the individuals
   themselves later in life. Offspring development in many mammalian
   species, for example, depends on interactions with the mother and
   siblings. In domestic pigs, individuals sharing the same juvenile
   environment develop similar body weight later in life. We, therefore,
   hypothesized that offspring originating from the same early-life
   environment also develop common social skills that generate early-life
   social effects (ELSEs) that affect the phenotypes of their social
   partners later in life. We, therefore, quantified IGEs and ELSEs on
   growth in domestic pigs. Results show that individuals from the same
   early-life environment express similar social effects on the growth of
   their social partners, and that such ELSEs shape the growth rate of
   social partners more than IGEs. Thus, the social skills that individuals
   develop in early life have a long-lasting impact on the phenotypes of
   social partners. Early-life and genetic social effects were independent
   of the corresponding direct effects of offspring on their own growth,
   indicating that individuals may enhance the growth of their social
   partners without a personal cost. Our findings also illustrate how
   research devoted to quantifying IGEs may miss nongenetic and potentially
   confounded social mechanisms which may bias the estimates of IGEs.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment modulates gene expression, physiology, behaviour
   and patterns of inheritance. For more than 50 years, this concept has
   been investigated using approaches that include partitioning the social
   component out of behavioural heritability estimates, studying maternal
   effects on offspring, and analysing dominance hierarchies. Recent
   advances have formalized this `social environment effect' by providing a
   more nuanced approach to the study of social influences on behaviour
   while recognizing evolutionary implications. Yet, in most of these
   formulations, the dynamics of social interactions are not accounted for.
   Also, the reciprocity between individual behaviour and group-level
   interactions has been largely ignored. Consistent with evolutionary
   theory, the principles of social interaction are conserved across a
   broad range of taxa. While noting parallels in diverse organisms, this
   review uses Drosophila melanogaster as a case study to revisit what is
   known about social interaction paradigms. We highlight the benefits of
   integrating the history and pattern of interactions among individuals
   for dissecting molecular mechanisms that underlie social modulation of
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among animals are general phenomena in domestic
   populations. However, at present, very little is known about the
   contribution of social effect to the selection efficiency of long-term
   response. In this study, the selection efficiency of a socially affected
   trait with different social effect was investigated in a closed nucleus
   population using stochastic simulation. Some key factors that affect
   selection efficiency of genetic social effect were also compared. The
   results showed social effect played an important role in a longer term
   breeding programme even though social effect had a small effect on the
   trait of interest. The percentage of expected total response contributed
   by social effect was up to 15.27 at the end generation under a very low
   level of social effect (0.3\% direct phenotypic variance). The full
   model with direct and social genetic effect, improved the selection
   efficiency of social effect and resulted in 4.89, 5.21 and 2.70\% more
   total cumulative selection response than the reduced model, without
   social effect, under the social effect size of 0.3, 1 and 10\% direct
   phenotypic variance, respectively. The social effect size and group
   member number showed more effect on the selection efficiency of social
   effect than other factors.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment of an animal is an especially interesting
   component of its environment because it can be shaped by both genetic
   and non-genetic variation among social partners. Indirect genetic
   effects (IGEs) are those created when genetic variation in social
   partners contributes to variation in an individual's phenotype; a
   potentially common form of IGE occurs when the expression of a
   behavioral phenotype depends on the particular genotypic combination of
   interacting individuals. Although IGEs can profoundly affect
   individual-and group-level fitness, population dynamics, and even
   community structure, understanding their importance is complicated by
   two inherent challenges: (1) identifying individuals with genetic
   differences in social interactions that can contribute to IGEs and (2)
   characterizing natural social interactions that potentially involve
   IGEs. As a first step toward addressing both these challenges in the
   same system, we investigated social interactions involving genetically
   distinct male color morphs in the poeciliid fish Gambusia holbrooki
   under natural and laboratory conditions. Previous work indicates that
   melanic (M) and silver (S) males differ in social behavior and in how
   conspecifics respond to them, suggesting the potential for IGEs. We used
   a combination of live and video recording of social groups in two
   natural populations and in the laboratory to determine the potential for
   IGEs to contribute to behavioral variation in this species. We found
   that M males had more social partners, and especially more female social
   partners than did S males, in nature and in the laboratory. These
   results suggest that both direct and indirect genetic effects have the
   potential to play a role in the expression and evolution of social
   behavior in G. holbrooki.}},

Abstract = {{Few issues have raised more debate among evolutionary biologists than
   kin selection (KS) versus multilevel selection (MLS). They are formally
   equivalent, but use different-looking mathematical approaches, and are
   not causally equivalent: for a given problem KS can be a more suitable
   causal explanation than MLS, and vice versa. Methods for analyzing a
   given model from both viewpoints would therefore be valuable. I argue
   that there is often an easy way to achieve this: MLS can be written
   using the components of KS. This applies to the very general regression
   approach as well as to the practical evolutionarily stable strategy
   (ESS) maximization approach, and can hence be used to analyze many
   common ESS models from a multilevel perspective. I demonstrate this with
   example models of gamete competition and limitation.}},

Abstract = {{Aggression at regrouping is a common issue in pig farming. Skin lesions
   are genetically and phenotypically correlated with aggression and have
   been shown to have a significant heritable component. This study
   predicts the magnitude of reduction in complex aggressive behavioural
   traits when using lesion numbers on different body regions at two
   different time points as selection criteria, to identify the optimum
   skin lesion trait for selection purposes. In total, 1146 pigs were mixed
   into new social groups, and skin lesions were counted 24 h (SL24h) and 3
   weeks (SL3wk) post-mixing, on the anterior, centre and posterior regions
   of the body. An animal model was used to estimate genetic parameters for
   skin lesion traits and 14 aggressive behavioural traits. Estimated
   breeding values (EBVs) and phenotypic values were scaled and
   standardised to allow direct comparison across multiple traits.
   Individuals with SL24h and SL3wk EBVs in the least aggressive 10\% of
   the population were compared with the population mean to predict the
   expected genetic and phenotypic response in aggressive behaviour to
   selection. At mixing, selection for low anterior lesions was predicted
   to affect substantially more behavioural traits of aggressiveness than
   lesions obtained on other body parts, with EBVs between -0.21 and -1.17
   SD below the population mean. Individuals with low central SL24h EBVs
   also had low EBVs for aggressive traits (-0.33 to -0.55). Individuals
   with high SL3wk EBVs had low EBVs for aggression at mixing (between
   -0.24 and -0.53 SD below the population mean), although this was
   predicted to affect fewer traits than selection against SL24h. These
   results suggest that selection against anterior SL24h would result in
   the greatest genetic and phenotypic reduction in aggressive behaviour
   recorded at mixing. Selection for increased SL3wk was predicted to
   reduce aggression at mixing; however, current understanding about
   aggressive behaviour under stable social conditions is insufficient to
   recommend using this trait for selection purposes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a reconceptualization of the social dimension
   of the human niche and the evolutionary process that brought it into
   existence. We agree with many other evolutionary approaches that a key
   aspect of the human niche is a social environment consisting primarily
   of cooperating and altruistic individuals, not a Hobbesian social
   environment of ``war of all against all.{''} However, in contrast to the
   conception of this social environment as consisting of individuals who,
   in Boyd and Richerson's words, ``cooperate with large groups of
   unrelated individuals,{''} we propose that it is more accurately
   described as consisting of cooperating individuals who currently are
   often nonkin but who, until relatively recently in human existence, were
   primarily, and in many cases almost exclusively, kin. In contrast to the
   conception of this social environment coming into existence by way of a
   process of selection within and between groups, we propose that it is
   the result of selection operating on traditions originated by ancestors
   and transmitted to their descendants. We use our fieldwork in three
   areas of the world (New Guinea, Ecuador, and Canada) to illustrate this
   process and how current social environments can be roughly placed on a
   continuum from traditional to nontraditional.}},

Abstract = {{Increased maternal age at reproduction is often associated with
   decreased offspring performance in numerous species of plants and
   animals (including humans). Current evolutionary theory considers such
   maternal effect senescence as part of a unified process of reproductive
   senescence, which is under identical age-specific selective pressures to
   fertility. We offer a novel theoretical perspective by combining William
   Hamilton's evolutionary model for aging with a quantitative genetic
   model of indirect genetic effects. We demonstrate that fertility and
   maternal effect senescence are likely to experience different patterns
   of age-specific selection and thus can evolve to take divergent forms.
   Applied to neonatal survival, we find that selection for maternal
   effects is the product of age-specific fertility and Hamilton's
   age-specific force of selection for fertility. Population genetic models
   show that senescence for these maternal effects can evolve in the
   absence of reproductive or actuarial senescence; this implies that
   maternal effect aging is a fundamentally distinct demographic
   manifestation of the evolution of aging. However, brief periods of
   increasingly beneficial maternal effects can evolve when fertility
   increases with age faster than cumulative survival declines. This is
   most likely to occur early in life. Our integration of theory provides a
   general framework with which to model, measure, and compare the
   evolutionary determinants of the social manifestations of aging.
   Extension of our maternal effects model to other ecological and social
   contexts could provide important insights into the drivers of the
   astonishing diversity of lifespans and aging patterns observed among
   species.}},

Title = {{The economic origins of ultrasociality}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Abstract = {{Ultrasociality refers to the social organization of a few species,
   including humans and some social insects, having a complex division of
   labor, city-states, and an almost exclusive dependence on agriculture
   for subsistence. We argue that the driving forces in the evolution of
   these ultrasocial societies were economic. With the agricultural
   transition, species could directly produce their own food and this was
   such a competitive advantage that those species now dominate the planet.
   Once underway, this transition was propelled by the selection of
   within-species groups that could best capture the advantages of (1)
   actively managing the inputs to food production, (2) a more complex
   division of labor, and (3) increasing returns to larger scale and larger
   group size. Together these factors reoriented productive life and
   radically altered the structure of these societies. Once agriculture
   began, populations expanded as these economic drivers opened up new
   opportunities for the exploitation of resources and the active
   management of inputs to food production. With intensified group-level
   competition, larger populations and intensive resource exploitation
   became competitive advantages, and the ``social conquest of Earth{''}
   was underway. Ultrasocial species came to dominate the earth's
   ecosystems. Ultrasociality also brought a loss of autonomy for
   individuals within the group. We argue that exploring the common causes
   and consequences of ultrasociality in humans and the social insects that
   adopted agriculture can provide fruitful insights into the evolution of
   complex human society.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are the basis of social interactions
   among conspecifics, and can affect genetic variation of nonsocial and
   social traits. We used flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) of two
   phenotypically distinguishable populations to estimate genetic
   (co)variances and the effect of IGEs on three life-history traits:
   development time (DT), growth rate (GR), and pupal body mass (BM). We
   found that GR was strongly affected by social environment with IGEs
   accounting for 18\% of the heritable variation. We also discovered a
   sex-specific social effect: male ratio in a group significantly affected
   both GR and BM; that is, beetles grew larger and faster in male-biased
   social environments. Such sex-specific IGEs have not previously been
   demonstrated in a nonsocial insect. Our results show that beetles that
   achieve a higher BM do so via a slower GR in response to social
   environment. Existing models of evolution in age-structured or
   stage-structured populations do not account for IGEs of social cohorts.
   It is likely that such IGEs have played a key role in the evolution of
   developmental plasticity shown by Tenebrionid larvae in response to
   density. Our results document an important source of genetic variation
   for GR, often overlooked in life-history theory.}},

   Selection and Sex-Limited Expression on the Evolution of Social Insect
   Genomes}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Kin selection theory has always been explicitly genetic and has long
   been invoked to explain the evolution of the sterile worker caste in the
   social insects. However, sociogenomic studies of the evolution and
   genomic basis of social insect caste have been largely disconnected from
   kin selection theory and other related genetic theories of social
   evolution. Two previous population genetic models make testable
   predictions for patterns of sequence diversity for genes shaped
   indirectly by kin selection compared to genes shaped directly by natural
   selection, but there is some confusion in the literature regarding the
   predicted effects of kin selection and sex-limited expression on
   molecular evolution. We review the previous models and then use a simple
   parental effect model to clarify that the two factors, kin selection and
   sex-limited expression, are distinct and each has a separate effect on
   the expected patterns of molecular evolution. We further build on the
   previous models to show how categories of genes in social insect genomes
   with diverse combinations of fitness effects (direct, parental, sib, and
   offspring) and patterns of sex-limitation are predicted to evolve. We
   discuss how caste- and sex-specific transcriptomic profiling, coupled
   with population genomic data, can be used to identify different
   functional categories of genes and subsequently test whether observed
   patterns of molecular evolution fit theoretical predictions.}},

Volume = {{450}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to estimate the growth trait parameters in
   grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella, which is one of the major
   freshwater aquaculture species in China. The heritability, genetic and
   phenotypic correlations were estimated for body weight, standard length,
   body height and body thickness measurements of 10 and 18 month old fish.
   Analyses were performed on a total of 41 and 104 full-sib families of
   grass carp including 937 and 2454 individuals at 10 (first spring) and
   18 months (second winter) of age, respectively. The families were
   reconstructed using the molecular pedigree based on twelve
   microsatellite loci, and 97.6\% of the offspring were unambiguously
   assigned to single parent pairs. Unbalanced contributions to progeny
   were found among families and parents (P < 0.01). Variance components
   and genetic parameters were estimated using the restricted
   maximum-likelihood algorithm with animal models. For all growth traits
   across two stages of grass carp, the common environment/maternal effect
   in proportion to phenotypic variance was very low (0.00-0.06), and not
   significant (P > 0.05). The heritability estimates for growth traits
   ranged from 0.24 to 0.38, and were significantly different from zero (P
   < 0.01). These results indicated that the breeding population had
   considerable additive genetic variation in growth traits, and the
   ongoing selective breeding program should produce considerable genetic
   improvement in the growth traits of the grass carp. High genetic and
   phenotypic correlations were found among growth traits (0.81-0.99, P <
   0.01). These data indicate that selection for improved standard length
   will have a favorable effect on body weight in grass carp which is the
   key economic parameter for production yield. High and positive genetic
   correlations between growth traits at 10 and 18 months of age were also
   detected in grass carp (0.87-0.95, P < 0.01), which indicated that
   individuals with higher growth performance at 10 months also grew to be
   better at 18 months. The results showed that genetic differences in
   growth traits among grass carp progeny could be determined earlier by
   measuring indicator traits predictive of long-term genetically
   determined growth.

Abstract = {{Conflict over parental investment between parent and offspring is
   predicted to lead to selection on genes expressed in offspring for
   traits influencing maternal investment, and on parentally expressed
   genes affecting offspring behaviour. However, the specific genetic
   variants that indirectly modify maternal or offspring behaviour remain
   largely unknown. Using a cross-fostered population of mice, we map
   maternal behaviour in genetically uniform mothers as a function of
   genetic variation in offspring and identify loci on offspring
   chromosomes 5 and 7 that modify maternal behaviour. Conversely, we found
   that genetic variation among mothers influences offspring development,
   independent of offspring genotype. Offspring solicitation and maternal
   behaviour show signs of coadaptation as they are negatively correlated
   between mothers and their biological offspring, which may be linked to
   costs of increased solicitation on growth found in our study. Overall,
   our results show levels of parental provisioning and offspring
   solicitation are unique to specific genotypes.}},

Abstract = {{As individual success often comes at the expense of others, interactions
   between the members of a species are frequently antagonistic, especially
   in the context of reproduction. In theory, this conflict may be reduced
   in magnitude when kin interact, as cooperative behaviour between
   relatives can result in increased inclusive fitness. Recent tests of the
   potential role of cooperative behaviour between brothers in Drosophila
   melanogaster have proved to be both exciting and controversial. We set
   out to replicate these experiments, which have profound implications for
   the study of kin selection and sexual conflict, and to expand upon them
   by also examining the potential role of kinship between males and
   females in reproductive interactions. While we did observe reduced
   fighting and courtship effort between competing brothers, contrary to
   previous studies we did not detect any fitness benefit to females as a
   result of the modification of male antagonistic behaviours. Furthermore,
   we did not observe any differential treatment of females by their
   brothers, as would be expected if the intensity of sexual conflict was
   mediated by kin selection. In the light of these results, we propose an
   alternative explanation for observed differences in male-male conflict
   and provide preliminary empirical support for this hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) in
   aquaculture worldwide, selective breeding programs for growth traits
   remain limited. This study aimed to assess the genetic effects and
   extent of genotype by environment interactions (G x E) for early growth
   traits in grass carp. Fifty-eight full-sib grass carp families (n =
   1704; 20 dams and 15 sires), cultured in two ponds, were reconstructed
   using molecular parentage analysis. Based on the animal model and
   restricted maximum likelihood (REML) algorithm, the heritability of
   standard length (SL), body weight (BW), and condition factor (K) of
   grass carp at 40 dph (days post-hatch) were calculated as 0.304, 0.307,
   and 0.150, respectively (P < 0.05). Significant genetic and phenotypic
   correlations were found between SL and BW, 0.838 and 0.958, respectively
   (P < 0.01). The REML likelihood-ratio test between the maternal effects
   model and animal model showed maternal effects were not significant in
   early-stage grass carp (P > 0.05). A significant interaction effect was
   found between family and environment (P < 0.01), while Pearson's
   correlations for SL and BW of grass carp in different ponds were 0.773
   and 0.630, respectively. Differential stabilities among families were
   responded to environments. These results indicate that the early growth
   traits of grass carp could be improved by exploiting additive genetic
   effects through selective breeding. Environmental effects and family
   stability should be taken into account in practical breeding programs.}},

Abstract = {{Gardner (2015) recently developed a model of a `Genetical Theory of
   Multilevel Selection, which is a thoughtfully developed, but flawed
   model. The model's flaws appear to be symptomatic of common
   misunderstandings of the multi level selection (MLS) literature and the
   recent quantitative genetic literature. I use Gardner's model as a guide
   for highlighting how the MLS literature can address the misconceptions
   found in his model, and the kin selection literature in general. I
   discuss research on the efficacy of group selection, the roll of
   indirect genetic effects in affecting the response to selection and the
   heritability of group-level traits. I also discuss why the Price
   multilevel partition should not be used to partition MLS, and why
   contextual analysis and, by association, direct fitness are appropriate
   for partitioning MLS. Finally, I discuss conceptual issues around
   questions concerning the level at which fitness is measured, the units
   of selection, and I present a brief outline of a model of selection in
   class-structured populations. I argue that the results derived from the
   MLS research tradition can inform kin selection research and models, and
   provide insights that will allow researchers to avoid conceptual flaws
   such as those seen in the Gardner model.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypes expressed in a social context are not only a function of the
   individual, but can also be shaped by the phenotypes of social partners.
   These social effects may play a major role in the evolution of
   cooperative breeding if social partners differ in the quality of care
   they provide and if individual carers adjust their effort in relation to
   that of other carers. When applying social effects models to wild study
   systems, it is also important to explore sources of individual
   plasticity that could masquerade as social effects. We studied offspring
   provisioning rates of parents and helpers in a wild population of
   long-tailed tits Aegithalos caudatus using a quantitative genetic
   framework to identify these social effects and partition them into
   genetic, permanent environment and current environment components.
   Controlling for other effects, individuals were consistent in their
   provisioning effort at a given nest, but adjusted their effort based on
   who was in their social group, indicating the presence of social
   effects. However, these social effects differed between years and social
   contexts, indicating a current environment effect, rather than
   indicating a genetic or permanent environment effect. While this study
   reveals the importance of examining environmental and genetic sources of
   social effects, the framework we present is entirely general, enabling a
   greater understanding of potentially important social effects within any
   ecological population.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one
   individual alter the expression of traits in social partners. Previous
   studies focused on the evolutionary consequences and evolutionary
   dynamics of IGEs, using equilibrium solutions to predict phenotypes in
   subsequent generations. However, whether or not such steady states may
   be reached may depend on the dynamics of interactions themselves.
   Results
   In our study, we focus on the dynamics of social interactions and
   indirect genetic effects and investigate how they modify phenotypes over
   time. Unlike previous IGE studies, we do not analyse evolutionary
   dynamics; rather we consider within-individual phenotypic changes, also
   referred to as phenotypic plasticity. We analyse iterative interactions,
   when individuals interact in a series of discontinuous events, and
   investigate the stability of steady state solutions and the dependence
   on model parameters, such as population size, strength, and the nature
   of interactions. We show that for interactions where a feedback loop
   occurs, the possible parameter space of interaction strength is fairly
   limited, affecting the evolutionary consequences of IGEs. We discuss the
   implications of our results for current IGE model predictions and their
   limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation in fitness is required for the adaptive evolution of
   any trait but natural selection is thought to erode genetic variance in
   fitness. This paradox has motivated the search for mechanisms that might
   maintain a population's adaptive potential. Mothers make many
   contributions to the attributes of their developing offspring and these
   maternal effects can influence responses to natural selection if
   maternal effects are themselves heritable. Maternal genetic effects
   (MGEs) on fitness might, therefore, represent an underappreciated source
   of adaptive potential in wild populations. Here we used two decades of
   data from a pedigreed wild population of North American red squirrels to
   show that MGEs on offspring fitness increased the population's
   evolvability by over two orders of magnitude relative to expectations
   from direct genetic effects alone. MGEs are predicted to maintain more
   variation than direct genetic effects in the face of selection, but we
   also found evidence of maternal effect trade-offs. Mothers that raised
   high-fitness offspring in one environment raised low-fitness offspring
   in another environment. Such a fitness trade-off is expected to maintain
   maternal genetic variation in fitness, which provided additional
   capacity for adaptive evolution beyond that provided by direct genetic
   effects on fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural ecologists increasingly study behavioural variation within
   and among individuals in conjunction, thereby integrating research on
   phenotypic plasticity and animal personality within a single adaptive
   framework. Interactions between individuals (cf. social environments)
   constitute a major causative factor of behavioural variation at both of
   these hierarchical levels. Social interactions give rise to complex
   `interactive phenotypes' and group-level emergent properties. This type
   of phenotype has intriguing evolutionary implications, warranting a
   cohesive framework for its study. We detail here how a reaction-norm
   framework might be applied to usefully integrate social environment
   theory developed in behavioural ecology and quantitative genetics. The
   proposed emergent framework facilitates firm integration of social
   environments in adaptive research on phenotypic characters that vary
   within and among individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Males can through their behavior (e.g., courtship feeding) exert an
   indirect effect on their partner's reproductive traits, such as the
   seasonal timing and size of her clutch. Evidence for such indirect
   (male) effect on reproduction is starting to accumulate. We quantify
   female and male effects on reproduction in the tawny owl Strix aluco
   using a hierarchical mixed model on data collected in 1978-2013. We find
   that differences between males explain 7 \% of the phenotypic variance
   in laying date (females 5 \%). In contrast, females have a clear (11 \%)
   effect on clutch size, whereas males have no effect. Based on
   multivariate hierarchical modeling, we find an individual-level
   correlation between the male-specific effect on laying date and his body
   mass (but not his plumage color or wing length). Heavy males may be able
   to affect their partner's seasonal timing of laying because of an
   advantage in providing courtship feeding prior to reproduction. Our
   findings illustrate that males can be an important determinant of
   variation in reproduction and that multivariate mixed models present a
   general approach to pinpoint which individual characteristics could be
   associated with such indirect effects.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are heritable effects of an individual
   on phenotypic values of others, and may result from social interactions.
   We determined the behavioural consequences of selection for IGEs for
   growth (IGEg) in pigs in a G x E treatment design. Pigs (n = 480) were
   selected for high versus low IGEg with a contrast of 14 g average daily
   gain and were housed in either barren or straw-enriched pens (n = 80).
   High IGEg pigs showed from 8 to 23 weeks age 40 \% less aggressive
   biting (P = 0.006), 27 \% less ear biting (P = 0.03), and 40 \% less
   biting on enrichment material (P = 0.005). High IGEg pigs had a lower
   tail damage score (high 2.0; low 2.2; P = 0.004), and consumed 30 \%
   less jute sacks (P = 0.002). Selection on high IGEg reduced biting
   behaviours additive to the, generally much larger, effects of
   straw-bedding (P < 0.01), with no G x E interactions. These results show
   opportunities to reduce harmful biting behaviours in pigs.}},

Title = {{Selection against somatic parasitism can maintain allorecognition in
   fungi}},
Journal = {{FUNGAL GENETICS AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{128-137}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Fusion between multicellular individuals is possible in many organisms
   with modular, indeterminate growth, such as marine invertebrates and
   fungi. Although fusion may provide various benefits, fusion usually is
   restricted to close relatives by allorecognition, also called
   heterokaryon or somatic incompatibility in fungi. A possible selective
   explanation for allorecognition is protection against somatic parasites.
   Such mutants contribute less to colony functions but more to
   reproduction. However, previous models testing this idea have failed to
   explain the high diversity of allorecognition alleles in nature. These
   models did not, however, consider the possible role of spatial
   structure. We model the joint evolution of allorecognition and somatic
   parasitism in a multicellular organism resembling an asexual ascomycete
   fungus in a spatially explicit simulation. In a 1000-by-1000 grid,
   neighbouring individuals can fuse, but only if they have the same
   allotype. Fusion with a parasitic individual decreases the total
   reproductive output of the fused individuals, but the parasite
   compensates for this individual-level fitness reduction by a
   disproportional share of the offspring. Allorecognition prevents the
   invasion of somatic parasites, and vice versa, mutation towards somatic
   parasitism provides the selective conditions for extensive
   allorecognition diversity. On the one hand, if allorecognition diversity
   did not build up fast enough, somatic parasites went to fixation;
   conversely, once parasites had gone to fixation no allorecognition
   diversity built up. On the other hand, the mere threat of parasitism
   could select for high allorecognition diversity, preventing invasion of
   somatic parasites. Moderate population viscosity combined with weak
   global dispersal was optimal for the joint evolution of allorecognition
   and protection against parasitism. Our results are consistent with the
   widespread occurrence of allorecognition in fungi and the low degree of
   somatic parasitism. We discuss the implications of our results for
   allorecognition in other organism groups. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Methods to address poultry robustness and welfare issues through
   breeding and associated ethical considerations}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{As consumers and society in general become more aware of ethical and
   moral dilemmas associated with intensive rearing systems, pressure is
   put on the animal and poultry industries to adopt alternative forms of
   housing. This presents challenges especially regarding managing
   competitive social interactions between animals. However, selective
   breeding programs are rapidly advancing, enhanced by both genomics and
   new quantitative genetic theory that offer potential solutions by
   improving adaptation of the bird to existing and proposed production
   environments. The outcomes of adaptation could lead to improvement of
   animal welfare by increasing fitness of the animal for the given
   environments, which might lead to increased contentment and decreased
   distress of birds in those systems. Genomic selection, based on dense
   genetic markers, will allow for more rapid improvement of traits that
   are expensive or difficult to measure, or have a low heritability, such
   as pecking, cannibalism, robustness, mortality, leg score, bone
   strength, disease resistance, and thus has the potential to address many
   poultry welfare concerns. Recently selection programs to include social
   effects, known as associative or indirect genetic effects (IGEs), have
   received much attention. Group, kin, multi-level, and multi-trait
   selection including IGEs have all been shown to be highly effective in
   reducing mortality while increasing productivity of poultry layers and
   reduce or eliminate the need for beak trimming. Multi-level selection
   was shown to increases robustness as indicated by the greater ability of
   birds to cope with stressors. Kin selection has been shown to be easy to
   implement and improve both productivity and animal well-being.
   Management practices and rearing conditions employed for domestic animal
   production will continue to change based on ethical and scientific
   results. However, the animal breeding tools necessary to provide an
   animal that is best adapted to these changing conditions are readily
   available and should be used, which will ultimately lead to the best
   possible outcomes for all impacted.}},

Title = {{The prospects of selection for social genetic effects to improve welfare
   and productivity in livestock}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Social interactions between individuals living in a group can have both
   positive and negative effects on welfare, productivity, and health of
   these individuals. Negative effects of social interactions in livestock
   are easier to observe than positive effects. For example, laying hens
   may develop feather pecking, which can cause mortality due to
   cannibalism, and pigs may develop tail biting or excessive aggression.
   Several studies have shown that social interactions affect the genetic
   variation in a trait. Genetic improvement of socially-affected traits,
   however, has proven to be difficult until relatively recently. The use
   of classical selection methods, like individual selection, may result in
   selection responses opposite to expected, because these methods neglect
   the effect of an individual on its group mates (social genetic effects).
   It has become clear that improvement of socially-affected traits
   requires selection methods that take into account not only the direct
   effect of an individual on its own phenotype but also the social genetic
   effects, also known as indirect genetic effects, of an individual on the
   phenotypes of its group mates. Here, we review the theoretical and
   empirical work on social genetic effects, with a focus on livestock.
   First, we present the theory of social genetic effects. Subsequently, we
   evaluate the evidence for social genetic effects in livestock and other
   species, by reviewing estimates of genetic parameters for direct and
   social genetic effects. Then we describe the results of different
   selection experiments. Finally, we discuss issues concerning the
   implementation of social genetic effects in livestock breeding programs.
   This review demonstrates that selection for socially-affected traits,
   using methods that target both the direct and social genetic effects, is
   a promising, but sometimes difficult to use in practice, tool to
   simultaneously improve production and welfare in livestock.}},

Abstract = {{Populations evolve in response to the external environment, whether
   abiotic (e. g., climate) or biotic (e. g., other conspecifics). We
   investigated how adaptation to biotic, heritable environments differs
   from adaptation to abiotic, nonheritable environments. We found that,
   for the same selection coefficients, the coadaptive process between
   genes and heritable environments is much faster than genetic adaptation
   to an abiotic nonheritable environment. The increased rate of adaptation
   results from the positive association generated by reciprocal selection
   between the heritable environment and the genes responding to it. These
   associations result in a runaway process of adaptive coevolution, even
   when the genes creating the heritable environment and genes responding
   to the heritable environment are unlinked. Although tightening the
   degree of linkage accelerates the coadaptive process, the acceleration
   caused by a comparable amount of inbreeding is greater, because
   inbreeding has a cumulative effect on reducing functional recombination
   over generations. Our results suggest that that adaptation to local
   abiotic environmental variation may result in the rapid diversification
   of populations and subsequent reproductive isolation not directly but
   rather via its effects on heritable environments and the genes
   responding to them.}},

Title = {{On the definition and utilization of heritable variation among hosts in
   reproduction ratio R-0 for infectious diseases}},
Journal = {{HEREDITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{364-374}},

Abstract = {{Infectious diseases have a major role in evolution by natural selection
   and pose a worldwide concern in livestock. Understanding quantitative
   genetics of infectious diseases, therefore, is essential both for
   understanding the consequences of natural selection and for designing
   artificial selection schemes in agriculture. The basic reproduction
   ratio, R-0, is the key parameter determining risk and severity of
   infectious diseases. Genetic improvement for control of infectious
   diseases in host populations should therefore aim at reducing R-0. This
   requires definitions of breeding value and heritable variation for R-0,
   and understanding of mechanisms determining response to selection. This
   is challenging, as R-0 is an emergent trait arising from interactions
   among individuals in the population. Here we show how to define breeding
   value and heritable variation for R-0 for genetically heterogeneous host
   populations. Furthermore, we identify mechanisms determining utilization
   of heritable variation for R-0. Using indirect genetic effects,
   next-generation matrices and a SIR (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered)
   model, we show that an individual's breeding value for R-0 is a function
   of its own allele frequencies for susceptibility and infectivity and of
   population average susceptibility and infectivity. When interacting
   individuals are unrelated, selection for individual disease status
   captures heritable variation in susceptibility only, yielding limited
   response in R-0. With related individuals, however, there is a secondary
   selection process, which also captures heritable variation in
   infectivity and additional variation in susceptibility, yielding
   substantially greater response. This shows that genetic variation in
   susceptibility represents an indirect genetic effect. As a consequence,
   response in R-0 increased substantially when interacting individuals
   were genetically related.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{The estimation of quantitative genetic parameters in wild populations is
   generally limited by the accuracy and completeness of the available
   pedigree information. Using relatedness at genomewide markers can
   potentially remove this limitation and lead to less biased and more
   precise estimates. We estimated heritability, maternal genetic effects
   and genetic correlations for body size traits in an unmanaged long-term
   study population of Soay sheep on St Kilda using three increasingly
   complete and accurate estimates of relatedness: (i) Pedigree 1, using
   observation-derived maternal links and microsatellite-derived paternal
   links; (ii) Pedigree 2, using SNP-derived assignment of both maternity
   and paternity; and (iii) whole-genome relatedness at 37 037 autosomal
   SNPs. In initial analyses, heritability estimates were strikingly
   similar for all three methods, while standard errors were systematically
   lower in analyses based on Pedigree 2 and genomic relatedness. Genetic
   correlations were generally strong, differed little between the three
   estimates of relatedness and the standard errors declined only very
   slightly with improved relatedness information. When partitioning
   maternal effects into separate genetic and environmental components,
   maternal genetic effects found in juvenile traits increased
   substantially across the three relatedness estimates. Heritability
   declined compared to parallel models where only a maternal environment
   effect was fitted, suggesting that maternal genetic effects are
   confounded with direct genetic effects and that more accurate estimates
   of relatedness were better able to separate maternal genetic effects
   from direct genetic effects. We found that the heritability captured by
   SNP markers asymptoted at about half the SNPs available, suggesting that
   denser marker panels are not necessarily required for precise and
   unbiased heritability estimates. Finally, we present guidelines for the
   use of genomic relatedness in future quantitative genetics studies in
   natural populations.}},

Title = {{The cultural evolution of emergent group-level traits}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{243+}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Many of the most important properties of human groups - including
   properties that may give one group an evolutionary advantage over
   another - are properly defined only at the level of group organization.
   Yet at present, most work on the evolution of culture has focused solely
   on the transmission of individual-level traits. I propose a conceptual
   extension of the theory of cultural evolution, particularly related to
   the evolutionary competition between cultural groups. The key concept in
   this extension is the emergent group-level trait. This type of trait is
   characterized by the structured organization of differentiated
   individuals and constitutes a unit of selection that is qualitatively
   different from selection on groups as defined by traditional multilevel
   selection (MLS) theory. As a corollary, I argue that the traditional
   focus on cooperation as the defining feature of human societies has
   missed an essential feature of cooperative groups. Traditional models of
   cooperation assume that interacting with one cooperator is equivalent to
   interacting with any other. However, human groups involve differential
   roles, meaning that receiving aid from one individual is often preferred
   to receiving aid from another. In this target article, I discuss the
   emergence and evolution of group-level traits and the implications for
   the theory of cultural evolution, including ramifications for the
   evolution of human cooperation, technology, and cultural institutions,
   and for the equivalency of multilevel selection and inclusive fitness
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness revolutionized our understanding
   of the evolution of social interactions. Surprisingly, an incorporation
   of Hamilton's perspective into the quantitative genetic theory of
   phenotypic evolution has been slow, despite the popularity of
   quantitative genetics in evolutionary studies. Here, we discuss several
   versions of Hamilton's rule for social evolution from a quantitative
   genetic perspective, emphasizing its utility in empirical applications.
   Although evolutionary quantitative genetics offers methods to measure
   each of the critical parameters of Hamilton's rule, empirical work has
   lagged behind theory. In particular, we lack studies of selection on
   altruistic traits in the wild. Fitness costs and benefits of altruism
   can be estimated using a simple extension of phenotypic selection
   analysis that incorporates the traits of social interactants. We also
   discuss the importance of considering the genetic influence of the
   social environment, or indirect genetic effects (IGEs), in the context
   of Hamilton's rule. Research in social evolution has generated an
   extensive body of empirical work focusing-with good reason-almost solely
   on relatedness. We argue that quantifying the roles of social and
   non-social components of selection and IGEs, in addition to relatedness,
   is now timely and should provide unique additional insights into social
   evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Social selection and indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are established
   concepts in both behavioural ecology and evolutionary genetics. While
   IGEs describe effects of an individual's genotype on phenotypes of
   social partners (and may thus affect their fitness indirectly), the
   concept of social selection assumes that a given phenotype in one
   individual affects the fitness of other individuals directly. Although
   different frameworks, both have been used to investigate the evolution
   of social traits, such as cooperative behaviour. Despite their
   similarities (both concepts consider interactions among individuals),
   they differ in the type of interaction. It remains unclear whether the
   two concepts make the same predictions about evolutionary trajectories
   or not. To address this question, we investigate four possible scenarios
   of social interactions and compare the effects of IGEs and social
   selection for trait evolution in a multi-trait multi-member model. We
   show that the two mechanisms can yield similar evolutionary outcomes and
   that both can create selection pressure at the group level. However, the
   effect of IGEs can be stronger due to the possibility of feedback loops.
   Finally, we demonstrate that IGEs, but not social selection gradients,
   may lead to differences in the direction of evolutionary response
   between genotypes and phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are widespread, both in natural
   and domestic populations. As a result, trait values of individuals may
   be affected by genes in other individuals, a phenomenon known as
   indirect genetic effects (IGEs). IGEs can be estimated using linear
   mixed models. The traditional IGE model assumes that an individual
   interacts equally with all its partners, whether kin or strangers. There
   is abundant evidence, however, that individuals behave differently
   towards kin as compared with strangers, which agrees with predictions
   from kin-selection theory. With a mix of kin and strangers, therefore,
   IGEs estimated from a traditional model may be incorrect, and selection
   based on those estimates will be suboptimal. Here we investigate whether
   genetic parameters for IGEs are statistically identifiable in
   group-structured populations when IGEs differ between kin and strangers,
   and develop models to estimate such parameters. First, we extend the
   definition of total breeding value and total heritable variance to cases
   where IGEs depend on relatedness. Next, we show that the full set of
   genetic parameters is not identifiable when IGEs differ between kin and
   strangers. Subsequently, we present a reduced model that yields
   estimates of the total heritable effects on kin, on non-kin and on all
   social partners of an individual, as well as the total heritable
   variance for response to selection. Finally we discuss the consequences
   of analysing data in which IGEs depend on relatedness using a
   traditional IGE model, and investigate group structures that may allow
   estimation of the full set of genetic parameters when IGEs depend on
   kin.}},

Abstract = {{Natural selection defined by differential survival and reproduction of
   individuals in populations is influenced by genetic, developmental, and
   environmental factors operating at every age and stage in human life
   history: generation of gametes, conception, birth, maturation,
   reproduction, senescence, and death. Biological systems are built upon a
   hierarchical organization nesting subcellular organelles, cells,
   tissues, and organs within individuals, individuals within families, and
   families within populations, and the latter among other populations.
   Natural selection often acts simultaneously at more than one level of
   biological organization and on specific traits, which we define as
   multilevel selection. Under this model, the individual is a fundamental
   unit of biological organization and also of selection, imbedded in a
   larger evolutionary context, just as it is a unit of medical
   intervention imbedded in larger biological, cultural, and environmental
   contexts. Here, we view human health and life span as necessary
   consequences of natural selection, operating at all levels and phases of
   biological hierarchy in human life history as well as in sociological
   and environmental milieu. An understanding of the spectrum of
   opportunities for natural selection will help us develop novel
   approaches to improving healthy life span through specific and global
   interventions that simultaneously focus on multiple levels of biological
   organization. Indeed, many opportunities exist to apply multilevel
   selection models employed in evolutionary biology and biodemography to
   improving human health at all hierarchical levels. Multilevel selection
   perspective provides a rational theoretical foundation for a synthesis
   of medicine and evolution that could lead to discovering effective
   predictive, preventive, palliative, potentially curative, and
   individualized approaches in medicine and in global health programs.}},

Pages = {{84-95}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Reproductive skew theory seeks to explain how reproduction is divided
   among group members in animal societies. Existing theory is framed
   almost entirely in terms of selection, though nonadaptive processes must
   also play some role in the evolution of reproductive skew. Here I
   propose that a genetic correlation between helper fecundity and breeder
   fecundity may frequently constrain the evolution of reproductive skew.
   This constraint is part of a wider phenomenon that I term caste load,
   which is defined as the decline in mean fitness caused by caste-specific
   selection pressures, that is, differential selection on breeding and
   nonbreeding individuals. I elaborate the caste load hypothesis using
   quantitative and population genetic arguments and individual-based
   simulations. Although selection can sometimes erode genetic correlations
   and resolve caste load, this may be constrained when mutations have
   similar pleiotropic effects on breeder and helper traits. I document
   evidence for caste load, identify putative genomic adaptations to it,
   and suggest future research directions. The models highlight the value
   of considering adaptation within the boundaries imposed by genetic
   architecture and incidentally reaffirm that monogamy promotes the
   evolutionary transition to eusociality.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGE) occur when the genotype of an individual
   affects the phenotypic trait value of another conspecific individual.
   IGEs can have profound effects on both the magnitude and the direction
   of response to selection. Models of inheritance and response to
   selection in traits subject to IGEs have been developed within two
   frameworks; a trait-based framework in which IGEs are specified as a
   direct consequence of individual trait values, and a variance-component
   framework in which phenotypic variance is decomposed into a direct and
   an indirect additive genetic component. This work is a selective review
   of the quantitative genetics of traits affected by IGEs, with a focus on
   modelling, estimation and interpretation issues. It includes a
   discussion on variance-component vs trait-based models of IGEs, a review
   of issues related to the estimation of IGEs from field data, including
   the estimation of the interaction coefficient W (psi), and a discussion
   on the relevance of IGEs for response to selection in cases where the
   strength of interaction varies among pairs of individuals. An
   investigation of the trait-based model shows that the interaction
   coefficient W may deviate considerably from the corresponding regression
   coefficient when feedback occurs. The increasing research effort devoted
   to IGEs suggests that they are a widespread phenomenon, probably
   particularly in natural populations and plants. Further work in this
   field should considerably broaden our understanding of the quantitative
   genetics of inheritance and response to selection in relation to the
   social organisation of populations.}},

Title = {{Competition as a source of constraint on life history evolution in
   natural populations}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{70-78}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Competition among individuals is central to our understanding of ecology
   and population dynamics. However, it could also have major implications
   for the evolution of resource-dependent life history traits (for
   example, growth, fecundity) that are important determinants of fitness
   in natural populations. This is because when competition occurs, the
   phenotype of each individual will be causally influenced by the
   phenotypes, and so the genotypes, of competitors. Theory tells us that
   indirect genetic effects arising from competitive interactions will give
   rise to the phenomenon of `evolutionary environmental deterioration',
   and act as a source of evolutionary constraint on resource-dependent
   traits under natural selection. However, just how important this
   constraint is remains an unanswered question. This article seeks to
   stimulate empirical research in this area, first highlighting some
   patterns emerging from life history studies that are consistent with a
   competition-based model of evolutionary constraint, before describing
   several quantitative modelling strategies that could be usefully
   applied. A recurrent theme is that rigorous quantification of a
   competition's impact on life history evolution will require an
   understanding of the causal pathways and behavioural processes by which
   genetic (co) variance structures arise. Knowledge of the G-matrix among
   life history traits is not, in and of itself, sufficient to identify the
   constraints caused by competition.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{117-123}},
Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Social dynamics, the emergent effects of interactions within structured
   groups, play a key role in shaping social phenotypes and fitness. We
   examined the potential positive and negative effects of social dynamics
   in simple groups, by creating social groups of harvester ant queens with
   2 alternate nest-founding strategies, solitary versus cooperative. We
   compared social interactions, survival, and nest productivity of pairs
   containing queens from the cooperative founding population, the normally
   solitary founding population, or mixed pairs of the 2 types. Expressed
   social phenotypes of queens in pairs depended strongly on the lineage of
   the other queen. Two behaviors, aggression and brood care, showed simple
   social dynamical effects. Aggression escalated in pairs of normally
   solitary queens, whereas queens in cooperative pairs coordinated brood
   output, leading to more efficient worker production. These dynamics had
   context-based fitness consequences, such that cooperative queens gained
   a survival advantage in cooperative pairs, but neither type of queen
   experienced an advantage or disadvantage in ``mixed{''} associations.
   The interplay between social dynamics and fitness in these associations
   provides an empirical example of social selection. It captures a likely
   scenario of the transition to and the early evolution of cooperative
   living, in which cooperative individuals interact with solitary
   individuals who lack a priori strategies for cooperation or cheating.}},

   at higher levels has gained considerable theoretical support in recent
   years, and one possible level of selection is the breeding pair where
   fitness is a function of the pair and cannot be reduced to single
   individuals. We analyzed the importance of pair-level selection over
   25years in a natural population of the collared flycatcher. Pair-level
   selection was significant in five and probably in another 9years. The
   relative importance of pair-level selection varied over years and can
   have stronger or the same strength as directional selection. This means
   that selection can act on the combination of the breeding pair in
   addition to selection on each individual separately. Overall, the
   conservative estimates obtained here show that this is a potentially
   important form of selection.}},

Title = {{Crozier's paradox revisited: maintenance of genetic recognition systems
   by disassortative mating}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Organisms are predicted to behave more favourably towards
   relatives, and kin-biased cooperation has been found in all domains of
   life from bacteria to vertebrates. Cooperation based on genetic
   recognition cues is paradoxical because it disproportionately benefits
   individuals with common phenotypes, which should erode the required cue
   polymorphism. Theoretical models suggest that many recognition loci
   likely have some secondary function that is subject to diversifying
   selection, keeping them variable.
   Results: Here, we use individual-based simulations to investigate the
   hypothesis that the dual use of recognition cues to facilitate social
   behaviour and disassortative mating (e. g. for inbreeding avoidance) can
   maintain cue diversity over evolutionary time. Our model shows that when
   organisms mate disassortatively with respect to their recognition cues,
   cooperation and recognition locus diversity can persist at high values,
   especially when outcrossed matings produce more surviving offspring.
   Mating system affects cue diversity via at least four distinct
   mechanisms, and its effects interact with other parameters such as
   population structure. Also, the attrition of cue diversity is less rapid
   when cooperation does not require an exact cue match. Using a literature
   review, we show that there is abundant empirical evidence that heritable
   recognition cues are simultaneously used in social and sexual behaviour.
   Conclusions: Our models show that mate choice is one possible resolution
   of the paradox of genetic kin recognition, and the literature review
   suggests that genetic recognition cues simultaneously inform assortative
   cooperation and disassortative mating in a large range of taxa. However,
   direct evidence is scant and there is substantial scope for future work.}},

Abstract = {{This article generalizes a set of core design principles for the
   efficacy of groups that was originally derived for groups attempting to
   manage common-pool resources (CPRs) such as irrigation systems, forests,
   and fisheries. The dominant way of thinking until recently was that
   commons situations invariably result in the tragedy of overuse,
   requiring either privatization (when possible) or top-down regulation.
   Based on a worldwide database of CPR groups, Ostrom proposed a set of
   principles that broadly captured the essential aspects of the
   institutional arrangements that succeeded, as contrasted to groups whose
   efforts failed. These principles can be generalized in two respects:
   first, by showing how they follow from foundational evolutionary
   principles; and second, by showing how they apply to a wider range of
   groups. The generality of the core design principles enables them to be
   used as a practical guide for improving the efficacy of many kinds of
   groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Kin selection theory is a kind of causal analysis. The initial form of
   kin selection ascribed cause to costs, benefits and genetic relatedness.
   The theory then slowly developed a deeper and more sophisticated
   approach to partitioning the causes of social evolution. Controversy
   followed because causal analysis inevitably attracts opposing views. It
   is always possible to separate total effects into different component
   causes. Alternative causal schemes emphasize different aspects of a
   problem, reflecting the distinct goals, interests and biases of
   different perspectives. For example, group selection is a particular
   causal scheme with certain advantages and significant limitations.
   Ultimately, to use kin selection theory to analyse natural patterns and
   to understand the history of debates over different approaches, one must
   follow the underlying history of causal analysis. This article describes
   the history of kin selection theory, with emphasis on how the causal
   perspective improved through the study of key patterns of natural
   history, such as dispersal and sex ratio, and through a unified approach
   to demographic and social processes. Independent historical developments
   in the multivariate analysis of quantitative traits merged with the
   causal analysis of social evolution by kin selection.}},

Abstract = {{When Hamilton defined the concept of inclusive fitness, he specifically
   was looking to define the fitness of an individual in terms of that
   individual's behavior, and the effects of its' behavior on other related
   individuals. Although an intuitively attractive concept, issues of
   accounting for fitness, and correctly assigning it to the appropriate
   individual make this approach difficult to implement. The direct fitness
   approach has been suggested as a means of modeling kin selection while
   avoiding these issues. Whereas Hamilton's inclusive fitness approach
   assigns to the focal individual the fitness effects of its behavior on
   other related individuals, the direct fitness approach assigns the
   fitness effects of other actors to the focal individual. Contextual
   analysis was independently developed as a quantitative genetic approach
   for measuring multilevel selection in natural populations. Although the
   direct fitness approach and contextual analysis come from very different
   traditions, both methods rely on the same underlying equation, with the
   primary difference between the two approaches being that the direct
   fitness approach uses fitness optimization modeling, whereas with
   contextual analysis, the same equation is used to solve for the change
   in fitness associated with a change in phenotype when the population is
   away from the optimal phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted comparing multilevel selection in Japanese
   quail for 43 days weight and survival with birds housed in either kin
   (K) or random (R) groups. Multilevel selection significantly reduced
   mortality (6.6\% K vs. 8.5\% R) and increased weight (1.30 g/MG K vs.
   0.13 g/MG R) resulting in response an order of magnitude greater with
   Kin than Random. Thus, multilevel selection was effective in reducing
   detrimental social interactions, which contributed to improved weight
   gain. The observed rates of response did not differ significantly from
   expected, demonstrating that current theory is adequate to explain
   multilevel selection response. Based on estimated genetic parameters,
   group selection would always be superior to any other combination of
   multilevel selection. Further, near optimal results could be attained
   using multilevel selection if 20\% of the weight was on the group
   component regardless of group composition. Thus, in nature the
   conditions for multilevel selection to be effective in bringing about
   social change maybe common. In terms of a sustainability of breeding
   programs, multilevel selection is easy to implement and is expected to
   give near optimal responses with reduced rates of inbreeding as compared
   to group selection, the only requirement is that animals be housed in
   kin groups.}},

Abstract = {{Precopulatory sexual selection is the association between fitness and
   traits associated with mate acquisition. Although sexual selection is
   generally recognized to be a powerful evolutionary force, most
   investigations are limited to characters belonging to individuals. A
   broader multilevel perspective acknowledges that individual fitness can
   be affected by aspects of mating success that are characters of groups,
   such as families. Parental mating success in polygynous or polyandrous
   human societies may exemplify traits under group-level sexual selection.
   Using fitness measures that account for age-structure, I measure
   multilevel selection for mate number over 55 years in a human population
   with declining rates of polygyny. Sexual selection had three components:
   individual-level selection for ever-mating (whether an individual mated)
   and individual- and family-level selection for polyandry and polygyny.
   Family- and individual-level selection for polygyny was equally strong,
   three times stronger than family-level selection for polyandry and more
   than an order of magnitude stronger than individual-level selection for
   polyandry. However, individual-level selection for polyandry and
   polygyny was more effective at explaining relative fitness variance than
   family-level selection. Selection for ever-mating was the most important
   source of sexual selection for fitness; variation for ever-mating
   explained 23\% of relative fitness variance.}},

Abstract = {{Models for the evolution of cannibalism highlight the importance of
   asymmetries between individuals in initiating cannibalistic attacks.
   Studies may include measures of body size but typically group
   individuals into size/age classes or compare populations. Such broad
   comparisons may obscure the details of interactions that ultimately
   determine how socially contingent characteristics evolve. We propose
   that understanding cannibalism is facilitated by using an interacting
   phenotypes perspective that includes the influences of the phenotype of
   a social partner on the behaviour of a focal individual and focuses on
   variation in individual pairwise interactions. We investigated how
   relative body size, a composite trait between a focal individual and its
   social partner, and the sex of the partners influenced precannibalistic
   aggression in the endangered Socorro isopod, Thermosphaeroma
   thermophilum. We also investigated whether differences in mating
   interest among males and females influenced cannibalism in mixed sex
   pairs. We studied these questions in three populations that differ
   markedly in range of body size and opportunities for interactions among
   individuals. We found that relative body size influences the probability
   of and latency to attack. We observed differences in the likelihood of
   and latency to attack based on both an individual's sex and the sex of
   its partner but found no evidence of sexual conflict. The instigation of
   precannibalistic aggression in these isopods is therefore a property of
   both an individual and its social partner. Our results suggest that
   interacting phenotype models would be improved by incorporating a new
   conditional , which describes the strength of a social partner's
   influence on focal behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Skew models predict how reproduction or resources produced by the group
   are divided between dominant and subordinate group members. These
   include transactional models, in which one group member may allocate
   some group productivity to another to prevent group dissolution and
   tug-of-war inefficiency models, in which group members compete for
   access to resources at a cost to group productivity. Although skew
   models involve a transactional or competitive interaction among group
   members, most existing models do not allow individuals to respond to new
   information about the strategy of their group mate. Here, I expand
   transactional and tug-of-war models to allow one individual (the
   follower) to respond plastically to a fixed strategy of its partner (the
   leader). I solve for the Stackelberg equilibrium conditions for each
   model. For the transactional model, leadership results in a greater
   share of group productivity to the leader compared with models that do
   not include leadership. When the follower's information about the
   leader's strategy is perfect, the equilibrium division of productivity
   does not vary with relatedness, in contrast to the predictions of
   previous skew models, and the effects of ecological variables may
   change. In the tug-of-war model, leadership influences equilibrium
   investment in competition only if relatedness is greater than zero.
   Dominant leaders receive a larger share of group productivity, but group
   productivity declines and grouping is mutually beneficial over a smaller
   parameter range than in the absence of leadership. Subordinate leaders
   receive a smaller share of group productivity, but benefit from overall
   higher group productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a number of prominent evolutionary biologists have contested
   the theory of kin selection and have in turn been strongly challenged by
   the majority of their colleagues. The heated nature of the argument over
   the role of kin and group selection in the evolution of altruism is a
   testament to the ways in which vested interests and intellectual
   territory disputes play out in scientific proceedings. However, a closer
   look at the history of attempts to understand the evolution of altruism,
   going back to Darwin, suggests that something more than mere academic
   sword-fighting is going on. There is a long history of social and
   biological thought intermingling and influencing each other when it
   comes to the study of social behavior. A consideration of this history,
   alongside a consideration of possible significant parallels in the
   evolution of sociality in nature and in man, may help to make better
   sense of why an entire community is up in arms about ants.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are heritable effects of individuals on
   trait values of their conspecifics. IGEs may substantially affect
   response to selection, but empirical studies on IGEs are sparse and
   their magnitude and correlation with direct genetic effects are largely
   unknown in plants.
   Here we used linear mixed models to estimate genetic (co) variances
   attributable to direct and indirect effects for growth and foliar
   disease damage in a large pedigreed population of Eucalyptus globulus.
   We found significant IGEs for growth and disease damage, which increased
   with age for growth. The correlation between direct and indirect genetic
   effects was highly negative for growth, but highly positive for disease
   damage, consistent with neighbour competition and infection,
   respectively. IGEs increased heritable variation by 71\% for disease
   damage, but reduced heritable variation by 85\% for growth, leaving
   nonsignificant heritable variation for later age growth. Thus, IGEs are
   likely to prevent response to selection in growth, despite a
   considerable ordinary heritability.
   IGEs change our perspective on the genetic architecture and potential
   response to selection. Depending on the correlation between direct and
   indirect genetic effects, IGEs may enhance or diminish the response to
   natural or artificial selection compared with that predicted from
   ordinary heritability.}},

Title = {{Phenotypic and Evolutionary Consequences of Social Behaviours:
   Interactions among Individuals Affect Direct Genetic Effects}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Traditional quantitative genetics assumes that an individual's phenotype
   is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. For many
   animals, part of the environment is social and provided by parents and
   other interacting partners. When expression of genes in social partners
   affects trait expression in a focal individual, indirect genetic effects
   occur. In this study, we explore the effects of indirect genetic effects
   on the magnitude and range of phenotypic values in a focal individual in
   a multi-member model analyzing three possible classes of interactions
   between individuals. We show that social interactions may not only cause
   indirect genetic effects but can also modify direct genetic effects.
   Furthermore, we demonstrate that both direct and indirect genetic
   effects substantially alter the range of phenotypic values, particularly
   when a focal trait can influence its own expression via interactions
   with traits in other individuals. We derive a function predicting the
   relative importance of direct versus indirect genetic effects. Our model
   reveals that both direct and indirect genetic effects can depend to a
   large extent on both group size and interaction strength, altering group
   mean phenotype and variance. This may lead to scenarios where between
   group variation is much higher than within group variation despite
   similar underlying genetic properties, potentially affecting the level
   of selection. Our analysis highlights key properties of indirect genetic
   effects with important consequences for trait evolution, the level of
   selection and potentially speciation.}},

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of how genetic effects arising from parental care influence
   the evolution of offspring traits comes almost exclusively from studies
   of maternal care. However, males provide care in some taxa, and often
   this care differs from females in quality or quantity. If variation in
   paternal care is genetically based then, like maternal care and maternal
   effects, paternal effects may have important consequences for the
   evolution of offspring traits via indirect genetic effects (IGEs). IGEs
   and directindirect genetic covariances associated with parental care can
   contribute substantially to total heritability and influence predictions
   about how traits respond to selection. It is unknown, however, if the
   magnitude and sign of parental effects arising from fathers are the same
   as those arising from mothers. We used a reciprocal cross-fostering
   experiment to quantify environmental and genetic effects of paternal
   care on offspring performance in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus
   vespilloides. We found that IGEs were substantial and direct-indirect
   genetic covariances were negative. Combined, these patterns led to low
   total heritabilities for offspring performance traits. Thus, under
   paternal care, offspring performance traits are unlikely to evolve in
   response to selection, and variation in these traits will be maintained
   in the population despite potentially strong selection on these traits.
   These patterns are similar to those generated by maternal care,
   indicating that the genetic effects of care on offspring performance are
   independent of the caregiver's sex.}},

Abstract = {{Through social interactions, individuals can affect one another's
   phenotype. The heritable effect of an individual on the phenotype of a
   conspecific is known as an indirect genetic effect (IGE). Although IGEs
   can have a substantial impact on heritable variation and response to
   selection, little is known about the genetic architecture of traits
   affected by IGEs. We studied IGEs for survival in domestic chickens
   (Gallus gallus), using data on two purebred lines and their reciprocal
   cross. Birds were kept in groups of four. Feather pecking and
   cannibalism caused mortality, as beaks were kept intact. Survival time
   was shorter in crossbreds than in purebreds, indicating outbreeding
   depression and the presence of nonadditive genetic effects. IGEs
   contributed the majority of heritable variation in crossbreds (87 and
   72\%) and around half of heritable variation in purebreds (65 and 44\%).
   There was no evidence of dominance variance, neither direct nor
   indirect. Absence of dominance variance in combination with considerable
   outbreeding depression suggests that survival is affected by many loci.
   Direct-indirect genetic correlations were moderately to highly negative
   in crossbreds (-0.37 +/- 0.17 and -0.83 +/- 0.10), but low and not
   significantly different from zero in purebreds (-0.20 +/- 0.21 and -0.28
   +/- 0.18). Consequently, unlike purebreds, crossbreds would fail to
   respond positively to mass selection. The direct genetic correlation
   between both crosses was high (0.95 +/- 0.23), whereas the indirect
   genetic correlation was moderate (0.41 +/- 0.26). Thus, for IGEs, it
   mattered which parental line provided the sire and which provided the
   dam. This indirect parent-of-origin effect appeared to be paternally
   transmitted and is probably Z chromosome linked.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one
   individual affect the phenotype of a conspecific. Theoretical models
   indicate that the evolutionary consequences of IGEs critically depend on
   the genetic architecture of interacting traits, and on the strength and
   direction of phenotypic effects arising from social interactions, which
   can be quantified by the interaction coefficient Psi. In the context of
   sexually selected traits, strong positive Psi tends to exaggerate
   evolutionary change, whereas negative Psi impedes sexual trait
   elaboration. Despite its theoretical importance, whether and how Psi
   varies among geographically distinct populations is unknown. Such
   information is necessary to evaluate the potential for IGEs to
   contribute to divergence among isolated or semi-isolated populations.
   Here, we report substantial variation in Psi for a behavioural trait
   involved in sexual selection in the field cricket Teleogryllus
   oceanicus: female choosiness. Both the strength and direction of Psi
   varied among geographically isolated populations. Psi also changed over
   time. In a contemporary population of crickets from Kauai, experience of
   male song increased female choosiness. In contrast, experience of male
   song decreased choosiness in an ancestral population from the same
   location. This rapid change corroborates studies examining the
   evolvability of Psi and demonstrates how interpopulation variation in
   the interaction coefficient might influence sexual selection and
   accelerate divergence of traits influenced by IGEs that contribute to
   reproductive isolation in nascent species or subspecies.}},

Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual variation in behaviour is widespread across taxa
   and behavioural categories. Because social behaviour is often a plastic
   response to the social environment, consistent variation in social
   behaviours such as aggression and cooperation may generate consistent
   variation in the behaviour of social partners and others in the group.
   In this study, we moved individual subordinate males between groups of a
   cooperatively breeding cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher. We found that
   subordinate males varied consistently in their aggressive interactions
   with neighbouring fish. The effects of individual subordinate males
   extended beyond their direct interactions; agonistic interactions
   between dominant males and dominant females varied consistently with
   subordinate male identity. We suggest that variation in helping
   behaviour through territorial defence influences the net fitness effects
   of subordinate males on dominant males and, thus, the potential for
   conflict between dominant males and dominant females over subordinate
   male presence. The existence of indirect phenotypic effects of
   subordinate males on interactions not directly involving the subordinate
   male suggests that individual personalities extend into the social
   environment and may be an important selective influence on social
   behaviour and on variation among social groups. (C) 2012 The Association

Abstract = {{Understanding the evolution of altruism requires knowledge of both its
   constraints and its drivers. Here we show that, paradoxically,
   ecological constraints on altruism may ultimately be its strongest
   driver. We construct a two-trait, coevolutionary adaptive dynamics model
   of social evolution in a genetically structured population with local
   resource competition. The intensity of local resource competition, which
   influences the direction and strength of social selection and which is
   typically treated as a static parameter, is here allowed to be an
   evolvable trait. Evolution of survival/fecundity altruism, which
   requires weak local competition, increases local competition as it
   evolves, creating negative environmental feedback that ultimately
   inhibits its further evolutionary advance. Alternatively, evolution of
   resource-based altruism, which requires strong local competition,
   weakens local competition as it evolves, also ultimately causing its own
   evolution to stall. When evolving independently, these altruistic
   strategies are intrinsically self-limiting. However, the coexistence of
   these two altruism types transforms the negative ecoevolutionary
   feedback generated by each strategy on itself into positive feedback on
   the other, allowing the presence of one trait to drive the evolution of
   the other. We call this feedback conversion reciprocal niche
   construction. In the absence of constraints, this process leads to
   runaway coevolution of altruism types. We discuss applications to the
   origins and evolution of eusociality, division of labor, the inordinate
   ecological success of eusocial species, and the interaction between
   technology and demography in human evolution. Our theory suggests that
   the evolution of extreme sociality may often be an autocatalytic
   process.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Multilevel selection has rarely been studied in the ecological context
   of animal populations, in which neighbourhood effects range from
   competition among territorial neighbours to source-sink effects among
   local populations. By studying a Dupont's lark Chersophilus duponti
   metapopulation, we analyze neighbourhood effects mediated by song
   repertoires on fitness components at the individual level (life-span)
   and population level (growth rate). As a sexual/aggressive signal with
   strong effects on fitness, birdsong creates an opportunity for group
   selection via neighbour interactions, but may also have population-wide
   effects by conveying information on habitat suitability to dispersing
   individuals. Within populations, we found a disruptive pattern of
   selection at the individual level and an opposite, stabilizing pattern
   at the group level. Males singing the most complex songs had the longest
   life-span, but individuals with the poorest repertoires lived longer
   than `average' males, a finding that likely reflects two male strategies
   with respect to fitness and sexual trait expression. Individuals from
   groups with intermediate repertoires had the longest life-span, likely
   benefitting from conspecific signalling to attract females up to the
   detrimental spread of competitive interactions in groups with superior
   vocal skills. Within the metapopulation selection was directional but
   again followed opposite patterns at the two levels: Populations had the
   highest growth rate when inhabiting local patches with complex
   repertoires surrounded by patches with simple repertoires. Here the song
   may impact metapopulation dynamics by guiding prospecting individuals
   towards populations advertising habitat quality. Two fitness components
   linked to viability were therefore influenced by the properties of the
   group, and birdsong was the target of selection, contributing to linking
   social/sexual processes at the local scale with regional population
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The Price equation partitions total evolutionary change into two
   components. The first component provides an abstract expression of
   natural selection. The second component subsumes all other evolutionary
   processes, including changes during transmission. The natural selection
   component is often used in applications. Those applications attract
   widespread interest for their simplicity of expression and ease of
   interpretation. Those same applications attract widespread criticism by
   dropping the second component of evolutionary change and by leaving
   unspecified the detailed assumptions needed for a complete study of
   dynamics. Controversies over approximation and dynamics have nothing to
   do with the Price equation itself, which is simply a mathematical
   equivalence relation for total evolutionary change expressed in an
   alternative form. Disagreements about approach have to do with the
   tension between the relative valuation of abstract versus concrete
   analyses. The Price equation's greatest value has been on the abstract
   side, particularly the invariance relations that illuminate the
   understanding of natural selection. Those abstract insights lay the
   foundation for applications in terms of kin selection, information
   theory interpretations of natural selection and partitions of causes by
   path analysis. I discuss recent critiques of the Price equation by Nowak
   and van Veelen.}},

Abstract = {{An unresolved controversy regarding social behaviors is exemplified when
   natural selection might lead to behaviors that maximize fitness at the
   social-group level but are costly at the individual level. Except for
   the special case of groups of clones, we do not have a general
   understanding of how and when group-optimal behaviors evolve, especially
   when the behaviors in question are flexible. To address this question,
   we develop a general model that integrates behavioral plasticity in
   social interactions with the action of natural selection in structured
   populations. We find that group-optimal behaviors can evolve, even
   without clonal groups, if individuals exhibit appropriate behavioral
   responses to each other's actions. The evolution of such behavioral
   responses, in turn, is predicated on the nature of the proximate
   behavioral mechanisms. We model a particular class of proximate
   mechanisms, prosocial preferences, and find that such preferences evolve
   to sustain maximum group benefit under certain levels of relatedness and
   certain ecological conditions. Thus, our model demonstrates the
   fundamental interplay between behavioral responses and relatedness in
   determining the course of social evolution. We also highlight the
   crucial role of proximate mechanisms such as prosocial preferences in
   the evolution of behavioral responses and in facilitating evolutionary
   transitions in individuality.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of heritability and genetic correlations are of central
   importance in the study of adaptive trait evolution and genetic
   constraints. We use a paternal half-sib-full-sib breeding design to
   investigate the genetic architecture of three life-history and
   morphological traits in the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus.
   Heritability was significant for all traits under observation and
   genetic correlations between traits (r(A)) were low. Interestingly, we
   found substantial sex-specific genetic effects and low genetic
   correlations between sexes (r(MF)) in traits that are only moderately
   (weight at emergence) to slightly (longevity) sexually dimorphic.
   Furthermore, we found an increased sire (s(sire)(2)) compared to
   dam(s(dam)(2)) variance component within trait and sex. Our results
   highlight that the genetic architecture even of the same trait should
   not be assumed to be the same for males and females. Furthermore, it
   raises the issue of the presence of unnoticed environmental effects that
   may inflate estimates of heritability. Overall, our study stresses the
   fact that estimates of quantitative genetic parameters are not only
   population, time, environment, but also sex specific. Thus,
   extrapolation between sexes and studies should be treated with caution.}},

Abstract = {{Animals living in cooperative groups experience fundamentally different
   environments than their nonsocial relatives, potentially changing the
   strength of natural selection on some aspects of their behavior. Using a
   comparative approach, we examined a potential example of this
   phenomenon: an association between reduced levels of maternal care
   behavior and sociality in cobweb spiders. We compared 6 different
   measures of maternal care behavior between species from 2 independently
   derived social clades and subsocial species from sister clades. In
   natural nests, we measured the mean distance between egg sacs and the
   nearest female and the proportion of egg sacs being attended. In the
   lab, we measured a female's willingness to accept an egg sac, abandon
   her egg sac when disturbed, repair a damaged egg sac, and the speed at
   which a female reclaimed her egg sac when separated from it. Social
   species from both social clades scored significantly lower than
   subsocial species from sister clades on 6 and 4 of 6 of these assays of
   maternal care, respectively. We discuss alternative explanations of this
   pattern, including the potential role of relaxed natural selection in a
   social environment in permitting the evolution of a novel
   ``low-parenting{''} phenotype.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-19}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In a model based on the wasp family Vespidae, the origin of worker
   behaviour, which constitutes the eusociality threshold, is not based on
   relatedness, therefore the origin of eusociality does not depend on
   inclusive fitness, and workers at the eusociality threshold are not
   altruistic. Instead, incipient workers and queens behave selfishly and
   are subject to direct natural selection. Beyond the eusociality
   threshold, relatedness enables soft inheritance as the framework for
   initial adaptations of eusociality. At the threshold of irreversibility,
   queen and worker castes become fixed in advanced eusociality.
   Transitions from solitary to facultative, facultative to primitive, and
   primitive to advanced eusociality occur via exaptation, phenotypic
   accommodation and genetic assimilation. Multilevel selection
   characterizes the solitary to highly eusocial transition, but components
   of multilevel selection vary across levels of eusociality. Roles of
   behavioural flexibility and developmental plasticity in the evolutionary
   process equal or exceed those of genotype.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1347-1359}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Genetic selection is a major force shaping life on earth. In classical
   genetic theory, response to selection is the product of the strength of
   selection and the additive genetic variance in a trait. The additive
   genetic variance reflects a population's intrinsic potential to respond
   to selection. The ordinary additive genetic variance, however, ignores
   the social organization of life. With social interactions among
   individuals, individual trait values may depend on genes in others, a
   phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects. Models accounting for
   indirect genetic effects, however, lack a general definition of
   heritable variation. Here I propose a general definition of the
   heritable variation that determines the potential of a population to
   respond to selection. This generalizes the concept of heritable variance
   to any inheritance model and level of organization. The result shows
   that heritable variance determining potential response to selection is
   the variance among individuals in the heritable quantity that determines
   the population mean trait value, rather than the usual additive genetic
   component of phenotypic variance. It follows, therefore, that heritable
   variance may exceed phenotypic variance among individuals, which is
   impossible in classical theory. This work also provides a measure of the

Abstract = {{Social interactions often have major fitness consequences, but little is
   known about how specific interacting phenotypes affect the strength of
   natural selection. Social influences on the evolutionary process can be
   assessed using a multilevel selection approach that partitions the
   effects of social partner phenotypes on fitness (referred to as social
   or group selection) from those of the traits of a focal individual
   (nonsocial or individual selection). To quantify the contribution of
   social selection to total selection affecting a trait, the patterns of
   phenotypic association among interactants must also be considered. We
   estimated selection gradients on male body size in a wild population of
   forked fungus beetles (Bolitotherus cornutus). We detected positive
   nonsocial selection and negative social selection on body size operating
   through differences in copulation success, indicating that large males
   with small social partners had highest fitness. In addition, we found
   that, in low-density demes, the phenotypes of focal individuals were
   negatively correlated with those of their social partners. This pattern
   reversed the negative effect of group selection on body size and led to
   stronger positive selection for body size. Our results demonstrate
   multilevel selection in nature and stress the importance of considering
   social selection whenever conspecific interactions occur nonrandomly.}},

Abstract = {{Inclusive fitness theory has a combination of simplicity, generality,
   and accuracy that has made it an extremely successful way of thinking
   about and modeling effects on kin. However, there are types of social
   interactions that, although covered, are not illuminated. Here, I expand
   the inclusive fitness approach and the corresponding neighbor-modulated
   approach to specify two other kinds of social selection. Kind selection,
   which includes green-beards and many nonadditive games, is where
   selection depends on an actor's trait having different effects on others
   depending on whether they share the trait. Kith selection includes
   social effects that do not require either kin or kind, such as mutualism
   and manipulation. It involves social effects of a trait that affect a
   partner, with feedback to the actor's fitness. I derive expanded
   versions of Hamilton's rule for kith and kind selection, generalizing
   Hamilton's insight that we can model social selection through a sum of
   fitness effects, each multiplied by an appropriate association
   coefficient. Kinship is, thus, only one of the important types of
   association, but all can be incorporated within an expanded inclusive
   fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Natural selection operates both directly, via the impact of a trait upon
   the individual's own fitness, and indirectly, via the impact of the
   trait upon the fitness of the individual's genetically related social
   partners. These effects are often framed in terms of Hamilton's rule, rb
   - c > 0, which provides the central result of social-evolution theory.
   However, a number of studies have questioned the generality of
   Hamilton's rule, suggesting that it requires restrictive assumptions.
   Here, we use Fisher's genetical paradigm to demonstrate the generality
   of Hamilton's rule and to clarify links between different studies. We
   show that confusion has arisen owing to researchers misidentifying model
   parameters with the b and c terms in Hamilton's rule, and misidentifying
   measures of genotypic similarity or genealogical relationship with the
   coefficient of genetic relatedness, r. More generally, we emphasize the
   need to distinguish between general kin-selection theory that forms the
   foundations of social evolution, and streamlined kin-selection
   methodology that is used to solve specific problems.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{By determining access to limited resources, social dominance is often an
   important determinant of fitness. Thus, if heritable, standard theory
   predicts mean dominance should evolve. However, dominance is usually
   inferred from the tendency to win contests, and given one winner and one
   loser in any dyadic contest, the mean proportion won will always equal
   0.5. Here, we argue that the apparent conflict between quantitative
   genetic theory and common sense is resolved by recognition of indirect
   genetic effects (IGEs). We estimate selection on, and genetic
   (co)variance structures for, social dominance, in a wild population of
   red deer Cervus elaphus, on the Scottish island of Rum. While dominance
   is heritable and positively correlated with lifetime fitness, contest
   outcomes depend as much on the genes carried by an opponent as on the
   genotype of a focal individual. We show how this dependency imposes an
   absolute evolutionary constraint on the phenotypic mean, thus
   reconciling theoretical predictions with common sense. More generally,
   we argue that IGEs likely provide a widespread but poorly recognized
   source of evolutionary constraint for traits influenced by competition.}},

Abstract = {{A key question in sexual selection is whether the ability of males to
   fertilize eggs under sperm competition exhibits heritable genetic
   variation. Addressing this question poses a significant problem,
   however, because a male's ability to win fertilizations ultimately
   depends on the competitive ability of rival males. Attempts to partition
   genetic variance in sperm competitiveness, as estimated from measures of
   fertilization success, must therefore account for stochastic effects due
   to the random sampling of rival sperm competitors. In this contribution,
   we suggest a practical solution to this problem. We advocate the use of
   simple cross-classified breeding designs for partitioning sources of
   genetic variance in sperm competitiveness and fertilization success and
   show how these designs can be used to avoid stochastic effects due to
   the random sampling of rival sperm competitors. We illustrate the
   utility of these approaches by simulating various scenarios for
   estimating genetic parameters in sperm competiveness, and show that the
   probability of detecting additive genetic variance in this trait is
   restored when stochastic effects due to the random sampling of rival
   sperm competitors are controlled. Our findings have important
   implications for the study of the evolutionary maintenance of polyandry.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are abundant both in natural and
   domestic populations. Such social interactions cause phenotypes of
   individuals to depend on genes carried by other individuals, a
   phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects (IGE). Because IGEs have
   drastic effects on the rate and direction of response to selection,
   knowledge of their magnitude and relationship to direct genetic effects
   (DGE) is indispensable for understanding response to selection. Very
   little is known, however, of statistical power and optimum experimental
   designs for estimating IGEs. This work, therefore, presents expressions
   for the standard errors of the estimated (co)variances of DGEs and IGEs
   and identifies optimum experimental designs for their estimation. It
   also provides an expression for optimum family size and a numerical
   investigation of optimum group size. Designs with groups composed of two
   families were optimal and substantially better than designs with groups
   composed at random with respect to family. Results suggest that IGEs can
   be detected with similar to 1000-2000 individuals and/or similar to
   250-500 groups when using optimum designs. Those values appear feasible
   for agriculture and aquaculture and for the smaller laboratory species.
   In summary, this work provides the tools to optimize and quantify the
   required size of experiments aiming to identify IGEs. An R-package SE.
   IGE is available, which predicts SEs and identifies optimum family and
   group sizes.}},

   empirical studies have suggested that parasites should be expected to be
   more `'prudent'' (less harmful and slower transmitting) when infection
   occurs locally. Using a novel approach based on spatial moment
   equations, we show that the evolution of parasites in spatially
   structured host populations is determined by the interplay of genetic
   and demographic spatial structuring, which in turn depends on the
   details of the ecological dynamics. This allows a detailed understanding
   of the roles of epidemiology, demography and network topology.
   Demographic turnover is needed for local interactions to select for
   prudence in the susceptible-infected models that have been the focus of
   previous studies. In diseases with little demographic turnover (as
   typical of many human diseases), we show that only parasites causing
   diseases with long-lived immunity are likely to be prudent in space. We
   further demonstrate why, at intermediate parasite dispersal, virulence
   can evolve to higher levels than predicted by non-spatial theory.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that competition among kin alters the rate and often
   the direction of evolution in subdivided populations. Yet much remains
   unclear about the ecological and demographic causes of kin competition,
   or what role life cycle plays in promoting or ameliorating its effects.
   Using the multilevel Price equation, I derive a general equation for
   evolution in structured populations under an arbitrary intensity of kin
   competition. This equation partitions the effects of selection and
   demography, and recovers numerous previous models as special cases. I
   quantify the degree of kin competition, alpha, which explicitly depends
   on life cycle. I show how life cycle and demographic assumptions can be
   incorporated into kin selection models via alpha, revealing life cycles
   that are more or less permissive of altruism. As an example, I give
   closed-form results for Hamilton's rule in a three-stage life cycle.
   Although results are sensitive to life cycle in general, I identify
   three demographic conditions that give life cycle invariant results.
   Under the infinite island model, alpha is a function of the scale of
   density regulation and dispersal rate, effectively disentangling these
   two phenomena. Population viscosity per se does not impede kin
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions among conspecifics influence social evolution through two
   distinct but intimately related paths. First, they provide the
   opportunity for indirect genetic effects (IGEs), where genes expressed
   in one individual influence the expression of traits in others. Second,
   interactions can generate social selection when traits expressed in one
   individual influence the fitness of others. Here, we present a
   quantitative genetic model of multivariate trait evolution that
   integrates the effects of both IGEs and social selection, which have
   previously been modeled independently. We show that social selection
   affects evolutionary change whenever the breeding value of one
   individual covaries with the phenotype of its social partners. This
   covariance can be created by both relatedness and IGEs, which are shown
   to have parallel roles in determining evolutionary response. We show
   that social selection is central to the estimation of inclusive fitness
   and derive a version of Hamilton's rule showing the symmetrical effects
   of relatedness and IGEs on the evolution of altruism. We illustrate the
   utility of our approach using altruism, greenbeards, aggression, and
   weapons as examples. Our model provides a general predictive equation
   for the evolution of social phenotypes that encompasses specific cases
   such as kin selection and reciprocity. The parameters can be measured
   empirically, and we emphasize the importance of considering both IGEs
   and social selection, in addition to relatedness, when testing
   hypotheses about social evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions, especially those involving competition among
   individuals, are important in domesticated livestock and in natural
   populations. The heritability of traits affected by such interactions
   has two components, one originating in the individual like that of
   classical traits (direct effects) and the other originating in other
   group members (indirect effects). The latter type of trait represents a
   significant source of `hidden heritability' and it requires population
   structure and knowledge from relatives in order to access it for
   selective breeding. When ignored, competitive interactions may increase
   as an indirect response to direct selection, resulting in diminished
   yields. We illustrate how population genetic structure affects the
   response to selection of traits with indirect genetic effects using
   population genetic and quantitative genetic theory. Population genetic
   theory permits us to connect our results to the existing body of theory
   on kin and group selection in natural populations. The quantitative
   genetic perspective allows us to see how breeders have used knowledge
   from relatives and family selection in the domestication of plants and
   animals to improve the welfare and production of livestock by
   incorporating social genetic effects in the breeding program. We
   illustrate the central features of these models by reviewing empirical
   studies from domesticated chickens.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions between individuals, such as co-operation and
   competition, are key factors in evolution by natural selection. As a
   consequence, evolutionary biologists have developed extensive theories
   to understand the consequences of social interactions for response to
   natural selection. Current genetic improvement programmes in animal
   husbandry, in contrast largely ignore the implications of social
   interactions for the design of breeding programmes. Recently, we have
   developed theoretical and empirical tools to quantify the magnitude of
   heritable social effects, ie the heritable effects that animals have on
   their group mates' traits, in livestock populations, and to utilise
   those effects in genetic improvement programmes. Results in commercial
   populations of pigs and laying hens indicate large heritable social
   effects, and the potential to substantially increase responses to
   selection in traits affected by social interactions. In pigs, including
   social effects into the breeding programme affected aggressive
   behaviour, both at mixing and in stable groups, indicating changes in
   the way dominance relationships are established and in aggressiveness.
   In laying hens, we applied selection between kin-groups to reduce
   mortality due to cannibalistic pecking. This resulted in a considerable
   difference in mortality between the low mortality line and the
   unselected control line in the first generation (20 vs 30\%).
   Furthermore, changes in behavioural and neurobiological responses to
   stress were detected in the low mortality line, pointing to reduced
   fearfulness and stress sensitivity. These first results indicate that
   including social effects into breeding programmes is a promising way to
   reduce negative social interactions in farm animals, and possibly to
   also increase positive social interactions, by breeding animals with
   better social skills.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary game theory is a general mathematical framework that
   describes the evolution of social traits. This framework forms the basis
   of many multilevel selection models and is also frequently used to model
   evolutionary dynamics on networks. Kin selection, which was initially
   restricted to describe social interactions between relatives, has also
   led to a broader mathematical approach, inclusive fitness, that can not
   only describe social evolution among relatives, but also in group
   structured populations or on social networks. It turns out that the
   underlying mathematics of game theory is fundamentally different from
   the approach of inclusive fitness. Thus, both approaches-evolutionary
   game theory and inclusive fitness-can be helpful to understand the
   evolution of social traits in group structured or spatially extended
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Efforts to understand the links between evolutionary and ecological
   dynamics hinge on our ability to measure and understand how genes
   influence phenotypes, fitness and population dynamics. Quantitative
   genetics provides a range of theoretical and empirical tools with which
   to achieve this when the relatedness between individuals within a
   population is known.
   2. A number of recent studies have used a type of mixed-effects model,
   known as the animal model, to estimate the genetic component of
   phenotypic variation using data collected in the field. Here, we provide
   a practical guide for ecologists interested in exploring the potential
   to apply this quantitative genetic method in their research.
   3. We begin by outlining, in simple terms, key concepts in quantitative
   genetics and how an animal model estimates relevant quantitative genetic
   parameters, such as heritabilities or genetic correlations.
   4. We then provide three detailed example tutorials, for implementation
   in a variety of software packages, for some basic applications of the
   animal model. We discuss several important statistical issues relating
   to best practice when fitting different kinds of mixed models.
   5. We conclude by briefly summarizing more complex applications of the
   animal model, and by highlighting key pitfalls and dangers for the
   researcher wanting to begin using quantitative genetic tools to address
   ecological and evolutionary questions.}},

Abstract = {{Competition and cooperation is fundamental to evolution by natural
   selection, both in animals and plants. Here, I investigate the
   consequences of such interactions for response in fitness due to natural
   selection. I provide quantitative genetic expressions for heritable
   variance and response in fitness due to natural selection when
   conspecifics interact. Results show that interactions among conspecifics
   generate extra heritable variance in fitness, and that interacting with
   kin is the key to evolutionary success because it translates the extra
   heritable variance into response in fitness. This work also unifies
   Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection (FTNS) and Hamilton's
   inclusive fitness (IF). The FTNS implies that natural selection
   maximizes fitness, whereas Hamilton proposed maximization of IF. This
   work shows that the FTNS describes the increase in IF, rather than
   direct fitness, at a rate equal to the additive genetic variance in
   fitness. Thus, Hamilton's IF and Fisher's FTNS both describe the
   maximization of IF.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which occur when phenotypic expression
   in one individual is influenced by genes in another conspecific
   individual, may have a drastic effect on evolutionary response to
   selection. General evolutionary models of IGEs have been developed using
   two distinct theoretical frameworks derived from maternal effects
   theory. The first framework is trait-based and focuses on how phenotypes
   are influenced by specific traits in a social partner, with the strength
   of interactions defined by the matrix Psi. The second framework
   partitions total genetic variance into components representing direct
   effects, indirect effects, and the covariance between them, without
   identifying specific social traits responsible for IGEs. The latter
   framework has been employed more commonly by empiricists because the
   methods for estimating variance components are relatively
   straightforward. Here, we show how these two theoretical frameworks are
   related to each other and derive equations that can be used to translate
   between them. This translation leads to a generalized method that can be
   used to estimate Psi via standard quantitative genetic breeding designs
   or pedigrees from natural populations. This method can be used in a very
   general set of circumstances and is widely applicable to all IGEs,
   including maternal effects and other interactions among relatives.}},

Abstract = {{How and why cooperation evolves, particularly among nonrelatives,
   remains a major paradox for evolutionary biologists and behavioral
   ecologists. Although much attention has focused on fitness consequences
   associated with cooperating, relatively little is known about the second
   component of evolutionary change, the inheritance of cooperation or
   reciprocity. The genetics of behaviors that can only be expressed in the
   context of interactions are particularly difficult to describe because
   the relevant genes reside in multiple social partners. Indirect genetic
   effects (IGEs) describe the influence of genes carried in social
   partners on the phenotype of a focal individual and thus provide a novel
   approach to quantifying the genetics underlying interactions such as
   reciprocal cooperation. We used inbred lines of guppies and a novel
   application of IGE theory to describe the dual genetic control of
   predator inspection and social behavior, both classic models of
   reciprocity. We identified effects of focal strain, social group strain,
   and interactions between focal and group strains on variation in focal
   behavior. We measured., the coefficient of the interaction, which
   describes the degree to which an individual's phenotype is influenced by
   the phenotype of its social partners. The genetic identity of social
   partners substantially influences inspection behavior, measures of
   threat assessment, and schooling and does so in positively reinforcing
   manner. We therefore demonstrate strong IGEs for antipredator behavior
   that represent the genetic variation necessary for the evolution of
   reciprocity.}},

Abstract = {{Kin and multilevel selection theories predict that genetic structure is

   among relatives can limit cooperative benefits, antagonizing the
   evolution of cooperation. We show that several ecological factors
   determine the extent to which kin competition constrains cooperative
   benefits. In addition, we argue that cooperative acts that expand local
   carrying capacity are less constrained by kin competition than other
   cooperative traits, and are therefore more likely to evolve. These
   arguments are particularly relevant to microbial cooperation, which
   often involves the production of public goods that promote population
   expansion. The challenge now is to understand how an organism's ecology
   influences how much cooperative groups contribute to future generations
   and thereby the evolution of cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Selection is recognized to operate on multiple levels. In disease
   organisms, selection among hosts is thought to provide an important
   counterbalance to selection for faster growth within hosts. We performed
   three experiments, each selecting for a divergence in group size in the
   entomopathogenic nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae. These nematodes
   infect and kill insect larvae, reproduce inside the host carcass, and
   emerge as infective juveniles. We imposed selection on group size by
   selecting among hosts for either high or low numbers of emerging
   nematodes. Our goal was to determine whether this trait could respond to
   selection at the group level, and if so, to examine what other traits
   would evolve as correlated responses. One of the three experiments
   showed a significant response to group selection. In that experiment,
   the high-selected treatment consistently produced more emerging
   nematodes per host than the low-selected treatment. In addition,
   nematodes were larger and they emerged later from hosts in the
   low-selected lines. Despite small effective population sizes, the
   effects of inbreeding were small in this experiment. Thus, selection
   among hosts can be effective, leading to both a direct evolutionary
   response at the population level, as well as to correlated responses in
   populational and individual traits.}},

Abstract = {{Aggressive behaviours are necessarily expressed in a social context,
   such that individuals may be influenced by the phenotypes, and
   potentially the genotypes, of their social partners. Consequently, it
   has been hypothesized that indirect genetic effects (IGEs) arising from
   the social environment will provide a major source of heritable
   variation on which selection can act. However, there has been little
   empirical scrutiny of this to date. Here we test this hypothesis in an
   experimental population of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using
   quantitative genetic models of five aggression traits, we find
   repeatable and heritable differences in agonistic behaviours of focal
   individuals when presented with an opponent mouse. For three of the
   traits, there is also support for the presence of IGEs, and estimated
   correlations between direct and indirect genetic (rA(O,F)) effects were
   high. As a consequence, any selection for aggression in the focal
   individuals should cause evolution of the social environment as a
   correlated response. In two traits, strong positive rA(O,F) will cause
   the rapid evolution of aggression, while in a third case changes in the
   phenotypic mean will be constrained by negative covariance between
   direct and IGEs. Our results illustrate how classical analyses may miss
   important components of heritable variation, and show that a full
   understanding of evolutionary dynamics requires explicit consideration
   of the genetic component of the social environment.}},

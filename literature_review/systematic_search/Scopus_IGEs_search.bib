abstract={Socially affected traits are affected by direct genetic effects (DGE) and social genetic effects (SGE). DGE and SGE of an individual directly quantify the genetic influence of its own phenotypes and the phenotypes of other individuals, respectively. In the current study, a total of 3,276 Large White pigs from different pens were used, and each pen contained 10 piglets. DGE and SGE were estimated for six socially affected traits, and then a GWAS was conducted to identify SNPs associated with DGE and SGE. Based on the whole-genome re-sequencing, 40 Large White pigs were genotyped and 10,501,384 high quality SNPs were retained for single-locus and multi-locus GWAS. For single-locus GWAS, a total of 54 SNPs associated with DGE and 33 SNPs with SGE exceeded the threshold (P < 5.00E-07) were detected for six growth traits. Of these, 22 SNPs with pleiotropic effects were shared by DGE and SGE. For multi-locus GWAS, a total of 72 and 110 putative QTNs were detected for DGE and SGE, respectively. Of these, 5 SNPs with pleiotropic effects were shared by DGE and SGE. It is noteworthy that 2 SNPs (SSC8: 16438396 for DGE and SSC17: 9697454 for SGE) were detected in single-locus and multi-locus GWAS. Furthermore, 15 positional candidate genes shared by SGE and DGE were identified because of their roles in behaviour, health and disease. Identification of genetic variants and candidate genes for DGE and SGE for socially affected traits will provide a new insight to understand the genetic architecture of socially affected traits in pigs. © 2019, The Author(s).},

abstract={Organisms can affect one another's phenotypes when they socially interact. Indirect genetic effects occur when an individual's phenotype is affected by genes expressed in another individual. These heritable effects can enhance or reduce adaptive potential, thereby accelerating or reversing evolutionary change. Quantifying these social effects is therefore crucial for our understanding of evolution, yet estimates of indirect genetic effects in wild animals are limited to dyadic interactions. We estimated indirect phenotypic and genetic effects, and their covariance with direct effects, for the date of spring breeding in North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) living in an array of territories of varying spatial proximity. Additionally, we estimated indirect effects and the strength of selection at low and high population densities. Social effects of neighbours on the date of spring breeding were different from zero at high population densities but not at low population densities. Indirect phenotypic effects accounted for a larger amount of variation in the date of breeding than differences attributable to the among-individual variance, suggesting social interactions are important for determining breeding dates. The genetic component to these indirect effects was however not statistically significant. We therefore showcase a powerful and flexible method that will allow researchers working in organisms with a range of social systems to estimate indirect phenotypic and genetic effects, and demonstrate the degree to which social interactions can influence phenotypes, even in a solitary species. © 2019 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

abstract={Background: In settings with social interactions, the phenotype of an individual is affected by the direct genetic effect (DGE) of the individual itself and by indirect genetic effects (IGE) of its group mates. In the presence of IGE, heritable variance and response to selection depend on size of the interaction group (group size), which can be modelled via a 'dilution' parameter (d) that measures the magnitude of IGE as a function of group size. However, little is known about the estimability of d and the precision of its estimate. Our aim was to investigate how precisely d can be estimated and what determines this precision. Methods: We simulated data with different group sizes and estimated d using a mixed model that included IGE and d. Schemes included various average group sizes (4, 6, and 8), variation in group size (coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 0.125 to 1.010), and three values of d (0, 0.5, and 1). A design in which individuals were randomly allocated to groups was used for all schemes and a design with two families per group was used for some schemes. Parameters were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Bias and precision of estimates were used to assess their statistical quality. Results: The dilution parameter of IGE can be estimated for simulated data with variation in group size. For all schemes, the length of confidence intervals ranged from 0.114 to 0.927 for d, from 0.149 to 0.198 for variance of DGE, from 0.011 to 0.086 for variance of IGE, and from 0.310 to 0.557 for genetic correlation between DGE and IGE. To estimate d, schemes with groups composed of two families performed slightly better than schemes with randomly composed groups. Conclusions: Dilution of IGE was estimable, and in general its estimation was more precise when CV of group size was larger. All estimated parameters were unbiased. Estimation of dilution of IGE allows the contribution of direct and indirect variance components to heritable variance to be quantified in relation to group size and, thus, it could improve prediction of the expected response to selection in environments with group sizes that differ from the average size. © 2019 The Author(s).},

abstract={We generally expect traits to evolve in the same direction as selection. However, many organisms possess traits that appear to be costly for individuals, while plant and animal breeding experiments reveal that selection may lead to no response or even negative responses to selection. We formalize both of these instances as cases of “opposite responses to selection.” Using quantitative genetic models for the response to selection, we outline when opposite responses to selection should be expected. These typically occur when social selection opposes direct selection, when individuals interact with others less related to them than a random member of the population, and if the genetic covariance between direct and indirect effects is negative. We discuss the likelihood of each of these occurring in nature and therefore summarize how frequent opposite responses to selection are likely to be.

abstract={A fundamental part of the quantitative genetic theory deals with the partitioning of the phenotypic variance into additive genetic and environmental components. During interaction with conspecifics, the interaction partner becomes a part of the environment from the perspective of the focal individual. If the interaction effects have a genetic basis, they are called indirect genetic effects (IGEs) and can evolve along with direct genetic effects. Sexual reproduction is a classic context where potential conflict between males and females can arise from trade-offs between current and future investments. We studied five female fecundity traits, egg length and number, egg pod length and number and latency to first egg pod, and estimated the direct and IGEs using a half-sib breeding design in the grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus. We found that the male IGEs were an order of magnitude lower than the direct genetic effects and were not significantly different from zero. However, there was some indication that IGEs were larger shortly after mating, consistent with the idea that IGEs fade with time after interaction. Female direct heritabilities were moderate to low. Simulation shows that the variance component estimates can appear larger with less data, calling for care when interpreting variance components estimated with low power. Our results illustrate that the contribution of male IGEs is overall low on the phenotypic variance of female fecundity traits. Thus, even in the relevant context of sexual conflict, the influence of male IGEs on the evolutionary trajectory of female reproductive traits is likely to be small. © 2019 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

abstract={This paper provides a critical analysis of genetically informed research on relationships, with an emphasis on relationships among unrelated individuals (e.g., spouses). To date, research in this area has used traditional behavioral genetic frameworks to either partition the variance in relationship-related outcomes into genetic and environmental components, or to examine gene–environment interplay between relationship factors and other outcomes. However, this conventional approach is at odds with the long-standing understanding from the field of relationship science that both partners’ characteristics matter when predicting shared outcomes—that is, outcomes that are emergent. We examine briefly the philosophical concept of emergence, and discuss ways to model dyadic outcomes in genetically informed relationships research. We also review the related topic of social genetic effects, which refer to the influence of a social partner’s genotype on a proband’s phenotype. A genetically informed dyadic perspective has potentially important consequences for our understanding of the pathways from genotype→shared or individual-level phenotypes, and more fully recognizes the complexity of how genetic and social/environmental factors come together to influence human behavior. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The social environment is expected to have substantial effects on behavior, and as a consequence, its heritability and evolvability. We investigated these effects by exposing Australian field crickets (Teleogryllus oceanicus) to either silence or recordings of male acoustic sexual signals. We used a combined pedigree and full-sib/half-sib breeding design to estimate the repeatability, heritability, and evolvability of behaviors related to boldness, exploration, and activity. All behaviors measured were significantly repeatable in both social environments. Additionally, most behaviors showed significant heritabilities in the two environments. We found no difference in repeatabilities between the silent and the acoustic environment but did find significant differences in the heritabilities and evolvabilities between these environments. There was a high degree of similarity between the phenotypic covariance matrices across the two environments, while the genotypic covariance matrices were highly dissimilar. Reflecting this, we found significant genotype-by-environment interactions for most of the behaviors. Lastly, we found that the repeatable aspect of behavior (“personality”) was significantly heritable for most behaviors, but that these heritabilities were higher in the acoustic than in the silent environment. We conclude that the social environment can have a significant impact on the heritability and evolvability of behavior, and argue that evolutionary inferences from phenotypic studies should be made with caution. © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={Cold tolerance plays a critical role in determining the geographical range limits of species. Previous studies have found that range shifts in response to climate warming are facilitated, paradoxically, by cold acclimation capacities, due to increasingly colder and variable weather at high latitudes. However, the evolutionary dynamics of this process are poorly understood. In this study we combined experiments and field studies to investigate the social and ecological factors affecting cold tolerances in range-shifting populations of the female-polymorphic damselfly Ischnura elegans in north-east Scotland, and their consequences for evolutionary change. In the field, we observed both environmental and social effects on cold tolerance and female colour morph frequencies. This process results in a latitudinal cline in female morph frequencies, due to positive feedback between social stress and thermal tolerances. Density manipulations in the laboratory provide experimental evidence that social interactions directly impact cold tolerance. Reciprocal effects of social environments on thermal acclimation may be important but commonly overlooked aspects of allee effects that contribute to the formation of range margins. Moreover, there is a wider need to consider the role of evolving social dynamics to reciprocally shape both the thermal physiology of individuals and the thermal niches of species. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={Social interactions can give rise to indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which occur when genes expressed in one individual affect the phenotype of another individual. The evolutionary dynamics of traits can be altered when there are IGEs. Sex often involves indirect effects arising from first-order (current) or second-order (prior) social interactions, yet IGEs are infrequently quantified for reproductive behaviors. Here, we use experimental populations of burying beetles that have experienced bidirectional selection on mating rate to test for social plasticity and IGEs associated with focal males mating with a female either without (first-order effect) or with (second-order effect) prior exposure to a competitor, and resource defense behavior (first-order effect). Additive IGEs were detected for mating rate arising from (first-order) interactions with females. For resource defense behavior, a standard variance partitioning analysis provided no evidence of additive genetic variance—either direct or indirect. However, behavior was predicted by focal size relative to that of the competitor, and size is also heritable. Assuming that behavior is causally dependent on relative size, this implies that both DGEs and IGEs do occur (and may potentially interact). The relative contribution of IGEs may differ among social behaviors related to mating which has consequences for the evolutionary trajectories of multivariate traits. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={An alternative implementation of the animal model including indirect genetic effect (IGE) is presented considering pair-mate-specific interaction degrees to improve the performance of the model. Data consisted of average daily gain (ADG) records from 663 pigs kept in groups of 10 to 14 mates during the fattening period. Three types of models were used to fit ADG data: (i) animal model (AM); (ii) AM with classical IGE (AM-IGE); and (iii) AM fitting IGE with a specific degree of interaction between each pair of mates (AM-IGEi). Several feeding behavior phenotypes were used to define the pair-mate-specific degree of interaction in AM-IGEi: feeding rate (g/min), feeding frequency (min/day), the time between consecutive visits to the feeder (min/day), occupation time (min/day) and an index considering all these variables. All models included systematic effects batch, initial age (covariate), final age (covariate), number of pigs per pen (covariate), plus the random effect of the pen. Estimated posterior mean (posterior SD) of heritability was 0.47 (0.15) using AM. Including social genetic effects in the model, total heritable variance expressed as a proportion of total phenotypic variance (T 2) was 0.54 (0.29) using AM-IGE, whereas it ranged from 0.51 to 0.55 (0.12 to 0.14) with AM-IGEi, depending on the behavior trait used to define social interactions. These results confirm the contribution of IGEs to the total heritable variation of ADG. Moreover, important differences between models were observed in EBV rankings. The percentage of coincidence of top 10% animals between AM and AM-IGEi ranged from 0.44 to 0.89 and from 0.41to 0.68 between AM-IGE and AM-IGEi. Based on the goodness of fit and predictive ability, social models are preferred for the genetic evaluation of ADG. Among models including IGEs, when the pair-specific degree of interaction was defined using feeding behavior phenotypes we obtained an increase in the accuracy of genetic parameters estimates, the better goodness of fit and higher predictive ability. We conclude that feeding behavior variables can be used to measure the interaction between pen mates and to improve the performance of models including IGEs. © 2018 The Animal Consortium.},

abstract={Social immunity moderates the spread of pathogens in social groups and is especially likely in groups structured by genetic relatedness. The extent to which specific immune pathways are used is unknown. Here, we investigate the expression and social role of three functionally separate immune genes (pgrp-sc2, thaumatin, and defensin) during parental care in the beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. These genes reside in different immune pathways, allowing us to test whether specific components of the immune system are targeted for social immunity. To test for the evolution of specificity, we manipulated the influence of social context and timing on gene expression and quantified the covariance of maternal immune gene expression and offspring fitness. Larvae reduced expression of all three genes in the presence of parents. Parental pgrp-sc2 and thaumatin increased during direct parenting, while defensin was upregulated before larvae arrived. Parental expression of pgrp-sc2 and thaumatin responded similarly to experimental manipulation of timing and presence of larvae, which differed from the response of defensin. We found a positive covariance between maternal expression and offspring fitness for pgrp-sc2 and thaumatin but not defensin. We suggest that social immunity can involve specific genes and pathways, reflecting evolution as an interacting phenotype during parenting. © 2018 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Indirect genetic effects (IGEs; the heritable influence of one organism on a conspecific) can affect the evolutionary dynamics of complex traits, including behavior. Voluntary wheel running is an important model system in quantitative genetic studies of behavior, but the possibility of IGEs on wheel running and its components (time spent running and average running speed) has not been examined. Here, we analyze a dataset from a replicated selection experiment on wheel running (11,420 control and 26,575 selected mice measured over 78 generations) in which the standard measurement protocol allowed for the possibility of IGEs occurring through odors because mice were provided with clean cages attached to a clean wheel or a wheel previously occupied by another mouse for 6 days. Overall, mice ran less on previously occupied wheels than on clean wheels, and they ran significantly less when following a male than a female. Significant interactions indicated that the reduction in running was more pronounced for females than males and for mice from selected lines than control mice. Pedigree-based “animal model” analyses revealed significant IGEs for running distance (the trait under selection), with effect sizes considerably higher for the initial/exploratory phase (i.e., first two of six test days). Our results demonstrate that IGEs can occur in mice interacting through scent only, possibly because they attempt to avoid conspecifics. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Our understanding of the evolutionary stability of socially selected traits is dominated by sexual selection models originating with R. A. Fisher, in which genetic covariance arising through assortative mating can trigger exponential, runaway trait evolution. To examine whether nonreproductive, socially selected traits experience similar dynamics—social runaway—when assortative mating does not automatically generate a covariance, we modeled the evolution of socially selected badge and donation phenotypes incorporating indirect genetic effects (IGEs) arising from the social environment. We establish a social runaway criterion based on the interaction coefficient, ψ, which describes social effects on badge and donation traits. Our models make several predictions. (1) IGEs can drive the original evolution of altruistic interactions that depend on receiver badges. (2) Donation traits are more likely to be susceptible to IGEs than badge traits. (3) Runaway dynamics in nonsexual, social contexts can occur in the absence of a genetic covariance. (4) Traits elaborated by social runaway are more likely to involve reciprocal, but nonsymmetrical, social plasticity. Models incorporating plasticity to the social environment via IGEs illustrate conditions favoring social runaway, describe a mechanism underlying the origins of costly traits, such as altruism, and support a fundamental role for phenotypic plasticity in rapid social evolution. © 2019 The Author(s).

abstract={Parental care is found widely across animal taxa and is manifest in a range of behaviours from basic provisioning in cockroaches to highly complex behaviours seen in mammals. The evolution of parental care is viewed as the outcome of an evolutionary cost/benefit trade-off between investing in current and future offspring, leading to the selection of traits in offspring that influence parental behaviour. Thus, level and quality of parental care are affected by both parental and offspring genetic differences that directly and indirectly influence parental care behaviour. While significant research effort has gone into understanding how parental genomes affect parental, and mostly maternal, behaviour, few studies have investigated how offspring genomes affect parental care. In this review, we bring together recent findings across different fields focussing on the mechanism and genetics of offspring effects on maternal care in mammals. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={A growing body of empirical work supports and informs the role of genetic variation and contemporary evolution in shaping ecological dynamics at the population, community and ecosystem levels. Although much progress has been made, I contend that reliance on several common empirical and inferential approaches is limiting forward progress in key areas, which leads me to several suggestions. More studies should focus on revealing eco-evolutionary dynamics as they play out in the “real world,” as opposed to laboratories and mesocosms. At the community and ecosystem levels, increasing effort should be directed towards the importance of evolution acting through population density, as opposed to only direct per-capita effects. More work should be directed towards the effects of whole-community evolution, as opposed to the evolution of only particular focal species. New and innovative approaches are needed for studying how natural selection resists evolutionary and ecological change, thus generating cryptic eco-evolutionary dynamics. Although simultaneous improvement on all of these fronts is perhaps impossible for any single research programme, even advances in one or more areas could dramatically improve our understanding of the prevalence, power and relevance of eco-evolutionary dynamics.

abstract={Both reciprocity and positive assortment (like with like) are predicted to promote the evolution of cooperation, yet how partners influence each other's behaviour within dynamic networks is not well understood. One way to test this question is to partition phenotypic variation into differences among individuals in the expression of cooperative behaviour (the 'direct effect'), and plasticity within individuals in response to the social environment (the 'indirect effect'). A positive correlation between these two sources of variation, such that more cooperative individuals elicit others to cooperate, is predicted to facilitate social contagion and selection on cooperative behaviour. Testing this hypothesis is challenging, however, because it requires repeated measures of behaviour across a dynamic social landscape. Here, we use an automated data-logging system to quantify the behaviour of 179 wire-tailed manakins, birds that form cooperative male-male coalitions, and we use multiple-membership models to test the hypothesis that dynamic network partnerships shape within-individual variation in cooperative behaviour. Our results show strong positive correlations between a bird's own sociality and his estimated effect on his partners, consistent with the hypothesis that cooperation begets cooperation. These findings support the hypothesis that social contagion can facilitate selection for cooperative behaviour within social networks. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={When individuals interact, their phenotypes may be affected not only by their own genes but also by genes in their social partners. This phenomenon is known as Indirect Genetic Effects (IGEs). In aquaculture species and some plants, however, competition not only affects trait levels of individuals, but also inflates variability of trait values among individuals. In the field of quantitative genetics, the variability of trait values has been studied as a quantitative trait in itself, and is often referred to as inherited variability. Such studies, however, consider only the genetic effect of the focal individual on trait variability and do not make a connection to competition. Although the observed phenotypic relationship between competition and variability suggests an underlying genetic relationship, the current quantitative genetic models of IGE and inherited variability do not allow for such a relationship. The lack of quantitative genetic models that connect IGEs to inherited variability limits our understanding of the potential of variability to respond to selection, both in nature and agriculture. Models of trait levels, for example, show that IGEs may considerably change heritable variation in trait values. Currently, we lack the tools to investigate whether this result extends to variability of trait values. Here we present a model that integrates IGEs and inherited variability. In this model, the target phenotype, say growth rate, is a function of the genetic and environmental effects of the focal individual and of the difference in trait value between the social partner and the focal individual, multiplied by a regression coefficient. The regression coefficient is a genetic trait, which is a measure of cooperation; a negative value indicates competition, a positive value cooperation, and an increasing value due to selection indicates the evolution of cooperation. In contrast to the existing quantitative genetic models, our model allows for co-evolution of IGEs and variability, as the regression coefficient can respond to selection. Our simulations show that the model results in increased variability of body weight with increasing competition. When competition decreases, i.e., cooperation evolves, variability becomes significantly smaller. Hence, our model facilitates quantitative genetic studies on the relationship between IGEs and inherited variability. Moreover, our findings suggest that we may have been overlooking an entire level of genetic variation in variability, the one due to IGEs. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={The severity of inbreeding depression often varies across environments and recent work suggests that social interactions can aggravate or reduce inbreeding depression. For example, stressful interactions such as competition can exacerbate inbreeding depression, whereas benign interactions such as parental care can buffer against inbreeding depression in offspring. Here, we test whether male assistance in parental care can buffer against the detrimental effects of maternal inbreeding on offspring fitness in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. Our results confirm that maternal inbreeding had detrimental effects on offspring survival. However, we found no evidence that male assistance in parental care buffered against those effects on offspring fitness. Outbred females benefitted from male assistance, gaining more weight over the breeding attempt when assisted by a male. In contrast, inbred females did not benefit from male assistance, gaining as much weight regardless of whether they were assisted by a male or not. Surprisingly, we find that males gained more weight during the breeding attempt when mated to an inbred female, suggesting that males benefitted from assisting an inbred female partner in terms of their weight gain. Overall, our findings suggest that parental care or other benign social interactions may not always buffer against detrimental effects of inbreeding depression. © 2018 Ratz, Castel and Smiseth.},

abstract={Mating between closely related individuals is often associated with fitness declines. However, less is known about consequences of inbreeding for (sexual) chemical signaling traits and for mate choice and acceptance. Thus, we investigated effects of inbreeding on the chemical phenotype, i.e., the profile and diversity of putative cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) in the leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae Fabricius. Moreover, we tested mating probabilities in no choice bioassays with different combinations of outbred and inbred beetles. Finally, we tested male preferences and female aggression in a dual choice bioassay with one outbred male, one outbred, and one inbred female. The chemical phenotype was altered in inbred females, which showed a male-like CHC profile. In no choice bioassays, inbred individuals had a decreased mating probability than outbred individuals. Changes in the chemical phenotype of inbred females might be involved in the negative inbreeding effects on mating acceptance. When having the choice, males did not show any preference between outbred and inbred females. However, inbred females were more aggressive in these situations, potentially to raise their chances to be mated, because due to inbreeding depression they have lower reproductive perspectives than outbred females. Overall, inbreeding effects on the chemical phenotype, mating acceptance and female aggression might have consequences for the population dynamics and development of the individuals. In conclusion, these results suggest that inbreeding events have the potential to affect sexual selection of chemical signaling traits and evolutionary processes underlying mating strategies. © 2018 Müller, Lachenicht and Müller.},

abstract={The expression of aggression depends not only on the direct genetic effects (DGEs) of an individual's genes on its own behavior, but also on indirect genetic effects (IGEs) caused by heritable phenotypes expressed by social partners. IGEs can affect the amount of heritable variance on which selection can act. Despite the important roles of IGEs in the evolutionary process, it remains largely unknown whether the strength of IGEs varies across life stages or competitive regimes. Based on manipulations of nymphal densities and > 3000 pair-wise aggression tests across multiple life stages, we experimentally demonstrate that IGEs on aggression are stronger in field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) that develop at lower densities than in those that develop at higher densities, and that these effects persist with age. The existence of density-dependent IGEs implies that social interactions strongly determine the plastic expression of aggression when competition for resources is relaxed. A more competitive (higher density) rearing environment may fail to provide crickets with sufficient resources to develop social cognition required for strong IGEs. The contribution of IGEs to evolutionary responses was greater at lower densities. Our study thereby demonstrates the importance of considering IGEs in density-dependent ecological and evolutionary processes. © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={Pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) are secreted by the trophoblast and are detectable in maternal circulation around the time of attachment of the fetal placenta, as well as in blood and milk throughout gestation. The understanding of the genetic mechanisms controlling PAG levels can confer advantages for livestock breeding programs given the precocity and the ease of obtaining this phenotype from routine pregnancy diagnosis. The aim of this study was to characterize PAG levels by estimating genetic parameters and correlations with other dairy traits, and to identify genomic regions and candidate genes associated with PAG levels in milk. The PAG data consisted of pregnancy diagnoses using commercial assays from 2012 to 2017, and genotype data consisted of 54,123 SNP markers for 2,352 individuals (embryos and dams). The model included contemporary group (herd, year, and season) and embryo age as fixed effects, and random embryonic (direct) and maternal (indirect) genetic effects. Using genomic data, the estimated heritability for direct and maternal genetic effects (± standard deviations) were 0.23 ± 0.05 and 0.11 ± 0.05, respectively. The genetic correlation between these effects was almost zero (0.001 ± 0.06). A preliminary analysis revealed low correlations between milk PAG levels and other dairy traits. The genome-wide association analysis was performed using 2 approaches: single-marker and single-step using all markers. Four genomic regions with direct genetic effects were detected on Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 6, BTA7, BTA19, and BTA29 of the embryonic genome. The BTA29 locus was within the bovine PAG gene cluster, suggesting a cis-regulatory quantitative trait locus on the PAG expression. However, other associations, without an obvious link to PAG expression, could be related to the transportation of PAG and their concentration in milk. Only 1 region from the maternal genome, on BTA4, had a significant indirect effect, where WNT2 is a candidate gene related to placenta vascularization and gestation health. Collectively, our results suggest a moderate genetic control of milk PAG levels from both maternal and fetal genomes, but larger studies are needed to fully evaluate the usefulness of milk PAG in the genetic evaluation of fetal growth and cow fertility. © 2018 American Dairy Science Association},

abstract={1. For this study a cohort of melanic Harmonia axyridis males homozygous for the spectabilis allele was produced. These were used to produce four kinds of twice-mated females, comprising all four permutations of melanic and non-melanic (succinic) males. A series of 12 larvae were then reared from the first and 10th clutches of each female to compare progeny developmental phenotypes. 2. There were no effects of mating treatment on overall female reproductive performance (preoviposition period, 20-day fecundity, or egg fertility). 3. Age-specific maternal effects were evident in progeny developmental phenotypes; larvae of 10th clutches developed more slowly, pupation was shorter, and adults emerged at heavier weights. 4. Paternal effects were superimposed on maternal effects and affected progeny independent of their paternity; melanic males induced slower larval development and slower pupation, but only in 10th clutches and only when they mated second. 5. There was a significant three-way interaction between male mating treatment, clutch number and progeny phenotype, indicating that progeny developmental responses to (mixed) paternal effects varied depending on their own phenotype and the time elapsed since their mother's last mating. 6. Melanic males mating second obtained a P2 advantage over succinic males, which increased from first to 10th clutch, but the reverse was not true when succinic males mated second. Thus, polyandry in H. axyridis facilitates both genetic and epigenetic competition among males while simultaneously enabling the sharing of predominant paternal effects among the progeny of different fathers. © 2018 The Royal Entomological Society},

abstract={Even though there has been great success in identifying lipid-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the mechanisms through which the SNPs act on each trait are poorly understood. The emergence of large, complex biological data sets in well-characterized cohort studies offers an opportunity to investigate the genetic effects on trait variability as a way of informing the causal genes and biochemical pathways that are involved in lipoprotein metabolism. However, methods for simultaneously analyzing multiple omics, environmental exposures, and longitudinally measured, correlated phenotypes are lacking. The purpose of our study was to demonstrate the utility of the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach to inform our understanding of the pathways by which genetic variants lead to disease risk. With the SEM method, we examine multiple pathways directly and indirectly through previously identified triglyceride (TG)-associated SNPs, methylation, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), including sex, age, and smoking behavior, while adding in biologically plausible direct and indirect pathways. We observed significant SNP effects (P < 0.05 and directionally consistent) on TGs at visit 4 (TG4) for five loci, including rs645040 (DOCK7), rs964184 (ZPR1/ZNF259), rs4765127 (ZNF664), rs1121980 (FTO), and rs10401969 (SUGP1). Across these loci, we identify three with strong evidence of an indirect genetic effect on TG4 through HDL, one with evidence of pleiotropic effect on HDL and TG4, and one variant that acts on TG4 indirectly through a nearby methylation site. Such information can be used to prioritize candidate genes in regions of interest, inform mechanisms of action of methylation effects, and highlight possible genes with pleiotropic effects. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Selection for indirect genetic effects (IGE), i.e. the genetic effect of an individual on a trait of another individual, is a promising avenue to increase trait values in plant and animal breeding. Studies in livestock suggest that selection for IGE for growth (IGEg) might increase animals’ capacity to tolerate stress. We assessed the effect of a stressful phase (weaning) on the behaviour and performance of pigs (n = 480) divergently selected for high or low IGEg. High IGEg pigs were significantly slower to explore the feed and gained less weight than low IGEg pigs in the days after weaning. In line with previous findings, high IGEg animals may have prioritized the formation of social ranks. © 2018, The Author(s).},

abstract={Social isolation has profound impacts. Most animal research focuses on negative phenotypic consequences of social isolation within individual lifetimes. Less is known about how it affects genetics, selection, and evolution over longer timescales, though ample indirect evidence suggests that it might. We advocate that evolutionary consequences of social isolation be tested more directly. We suggest that the ‘index of social isolation’ the mismatch between actual and optimal social interaction experienced by individuals within a population, may play a key role in releasing cryptic genetic variation, adaptation rates, diversification patterns, and ecosystem-level processes. Evolutionary dynamics arising from social isolation could have significant impacts in applied settings such as conservation, animal breeding, control of biological invasions, and evolutionary resilience to anthropogenic change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Background: Cannibalism is an important welfare problem in the layer industry. Cannibalism is a social behavior where individual survival is affected by direct genetic effects (DGE) and indirect genetic effects (IGE). Previous studies analysed repeated binomial survival, instead of survival time, which improved accuracies of breeding value predictions. Our study aimed at identifying SNPs associated with DGE and IGE for survival time, and comparing results from models that analyse survival time and repeated binomial survival. Methods: Survival data of three layer crosses (W1 * WA, W1 * WB, and W1 * WC) were used. Each individual had one survival time record and 13 monthly survival (0/1) records. Approximately 30,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were included in the genome-wide association study (GWAS), using a linear mixed model for survival time, a linear mixed model and a generalized linear mixed model for repeated binomial survival (0/1). Backwards elimination was used to determine phenotypic and genetic variance explained by SNPs. Results: The same quantitative trait loci were identified with all models. A SNP associated with DGE was found in cross W1 * WA, with an allele substitution effect of 22 days. This SNP explained 3% of the phenotypic variance, and 36% of the total genetic variance. Four SNPs associated with DGE were found in cross W1 * WB, with effects ranging from 16 to 35 days. These SNPs explained 1 to 6% of the phenotypic variance and 9 to 44% of the total genetic variance. Our results suggest a link of DGE and IGE for survival time in layers with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, since a SNP located near a gene for a GABA receptor was associated with DGE and with IGE (not significant). Conclusions: This is one of the first large studies investigating the genetic architecture of a socially-affected trait. The power to detect SNP associations was relatively low and thus we expect that many effects on DGE and IGE remained undetected. Yet, GWAS results revealed SNPs with large DGE and a link of DGE and IGE for survival time in layers with the GABAergic system, which supports existing evidence for the involvement of GABA in the development of abnormal behaviors. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Objective: The genetic effects of an individual on the phenotypes of its social partners, such as its pen mates, are known as social genetic effects. This study aims to identify the candidate genes for social (pen-mates') average daily gain (ADG) in pigs by using the genome-wide association approach. Methods: Social ADG (sADG) was the average ADG of unrelated pen-mates (strangers). We used the phenotype data (16,802 records) after correcting for batch (week), sex, pen, number of strangers (1 to 7 pigs) in the pen, full-sib rate (0% to 80%) within pen, and age at the end of the test. A total of 1,041 pigs from Landrace breeds were genotyped using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 v2 BeadChip panel, which comprised 61,565 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. After quality control, 909 individuals and 39,837 markers remained for sADG in genome-wide association study. Results: We detected five new SNPs, all on chromosome 6, which have not been associated with social ADG or other growth traits to date. One SNP was inside the prostaglandin F2α receptor (PTGFR) gene, another SNP was located 22 kb upstream of gene interferon-induced protein 44 (IFI44), and the last three SNPs were between 161 kb and 191 kb upstream of the EGF latrophilin and seven transmembrane domain-containing protein 1 (ELTD1) gene. PTGFR, IFI44, and ELTD1 were never associated with social interaction and social genetic effects in any of the previous studies. Conclusion: The identification of several genomic regions, and candidate genes associated with social genetic effects reported here, could contribute to a better understanding of the genetic basis of interaction traits for ADG. In conclusion, we suggest that the PTGFR, IFI44, and ELTD1 may be used as a molecular marker for sADG, although their functional effect was not defined yet. Thus, it will be of interest to execute association studies in those genes. Copyright © 2018 by Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences.},

abstract={Sexual selection generally involves males evolving secondary sexual characters that satisfy the mating preferences of females. Behavioral ecologists have spent considerable research effort on identifying how variation in sexually-selected traits in insects is maintained among males at the expense of investigating the proximate and ultimate causes of variation in female mating preferences for those male traits. The past decade has witnessed improved effort in redressing this bias in insects with researchers identifying a host of factors intrinsic and extrinsic to the female as mediating flexibility in female mating behavior. Evidence is mounting that a female's social environment, whether experienced during development or as an adult, is key to shaping her mating preferences. Others have extended these observations to show that the genetic identity of the conspecific individuals comprising the social environment can have profound effects on female mating preferences via indirect genetic effects (IGEs), or through interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGEs) if the genotype of heterospecifics influences plasticity in mating preferences. Considerably more work is needed to not only expand our list of mediating intrinsic and extrinsic factors but also to identify how their interaction influences individual variation in male and female mating preferences. © 2018},

Here, we investigate effects of offspring and maternal inbreeding on parent-offspring communication in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. We find effects of the interaction between offspring and maternal inbreeding on maternal behavior. Outbred females provided more direct care toward inbred larvae, while inbred females provided similar levels of direct care toward inbred and outbred larvae. Furthermore, we find direct and indirect effects of offspring inbreeding on offspring begging and maternal behavior, respectively. Inbred larvae spent less time begging than outbred larvae, and (outbred) females provided more direct care and less indirect care toward inbred larvae.

abstract={Inbreeding depression plays a significant role in evolutionary biology and ecology. However, we lack a clear understanding of the fitness consequences of inbreeding depression. Studies often focus on short-term effects of inbreeding in juvenile offspring, whereas inbreeding depression in adult traits and the interplay between inbreeding depression and age are rarely addressed. Inbreeding depression may increase with age and accelerate the decline in reproductive output in ageing individuals (reproductive senescence), which could be subject to sex-specific dynamics.We test this hypothesis with a longitudinal experimental study in a short-lived songbird. Adult inbred and outbred male and female canaries were paired in a 2 × 2 factorial design, and survival and annual reproductive performance were studied for 3 years. We found inbreeding depression in female egg-laying ability, male fertilization success and survival of both sexes. Annual reproductive success of both males and females declined when paired with an inbred partner independent of their own inbreeding status. This shows that inbreeding can have fitness costs in outbred individuals when they mate with an inbred individual. Further, inbred females showed faster reproductive senescence than outbred females, confirming that inbreeding depression and age can interact to affect fitness. By contrast, there was no evidence for an interaction between inbreeding depression and reproductive senescence in male fertilization success. Our findings highlight the importance of considering sex-specific effects and age to determine the full range of fitness consequences of inbreeding and demonstrate that inbreeding depression can accelerate reproductive senescence. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Background: Indirect genetic effects (IGE) are important components of various traits in several species. Although the intensity of social interactions between partners likely vary over time, very few genetic studies have investigated how IGE vary over time for traits under selection in livestock species. To overcome this issue, our aim was: (1) to analyze longitudinal records of average daily gain (ADG) in rabbits subjected to a 5-week period of feed restriction using a structured antedependence (SAD) model that includes IGE and (2) to evaluate, by simulation, the response to selection when IGE are present and genetic evaluation is based on a SAD model that includes IGE or not. Results: The direct genetic variance for ADG (g/d) increased from week 1 to 3 [from 8.03 to 13.47 (g/d)2] and then decreased [6.20 (g/d)2 at week 5], while the indirect genetic variance decreased from week 1 to 4 [from 0.43 to 0.22 (g/d)2]. The correlation between the direct genetic effects of different weeks was moderate to high (ranging from 0.46 to 0.86) and tended to decrease with time interval between measurements. The same trend was observed for IGE for weeks 2 to 5 (correlations ranging from 0.62 to 0.91). Estimates of the correlation between IGE of week 1 and IGE of the other weeks did not follow the same pattern and correlations were lower. Estimates of correlations between direct and indirect effects were negative at all times. After seven generations of simulated selection, the increase in ADG from selection on EBV from a SAD model that included IGE was higher (~ 30%) than when those effects were omitted. Conclusions: Indirect genetic effects are larger just after mixing animals at weaning than later in the fattening period, probably because of the establishment of social hierarchy that is generally observed at that time. Accounting for IGE in the selection criterion maximizes genetic progress. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Theory on indirect genetic effects (IGEs) indicates that variation in the genetic composition of social groups can generate GxG epistasis that may promote the evolution of stable polymorphisms. Using a livebearing fish with a genetic polymorphism in coloration and associated behavioral differences, we tested whether genotypes of social partners interacted with focal individual genotypes to influence growth and condition over 16 weeks of development. We found that IGEs had a significant influence on patterns of feeding, regardless of focal fish genotype. There was no influence of social environment on juvenile length, but there was significant GxG epistasis for body condition. Each focal juvenile was in better condition when its own genotype was not present in adult social partners. These data are consistent with negative frequency-dependent selection in which each morph performs better when it is rare. Neither variation in feeding nor activity-related behaviors explained variation in body condition, suggesting that GxG epistasis for condition was caused by physiological differences between the two genotypes. These findings indicate that GxG epistasis in a given polymorphism can generate fitness landscapes that contribute to the maintenance of that polymorphism and to maintenance of genetic variation for additional fitness-related traits. © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={Sexual reproduction is inherently interactive, especially in animal species such as humans that exhibit extended pair bonding. Yet we have little knowledge of the role of male characteristics and their evolutionary impact on reproductive behavioural phenotypes, to the extent that biologists typically consider component traits (e.g. reproductive timing) as female-specific. Based on extensive genealogical data detailing the life histories of 6435 human mothers born across four centuries of modern history, we use an animal modelling approach to estimate the indirect genetic effect of men on the reproductive phenotype of their partners. These analyses showthat awoman’s reproductive timing (age at first birth) is influenced by her partner’s genotype. This indirect genetic effect is positively correlated with the direct genetic effect expressed in women, such that total heritable variance in this trait is doubled when heritable partner effects are considered. Our study thus suggests that much of the heritable variation in women’s reproductive timing is mediated via partner effects, and that the evolutionary potential of this trait is far greater than previously appreciated. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={The environment can have a considerable impact on behaviour. The social environment is predicted to be a particularly important driver of behavioural variation and evolution through the indirect genetic effects that arise whenever individuals interact with conspecifics. We used male Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, to examine the effects of changes in the social environment (recorded acoustic sexual signals of other males) on the expression and consistency of boldness, activity and exploration, and their between-individual covariation. Switching from a silent environment to being exposed to male acoustic sexual signals resulted in crickets becoming less bold, active and explorative. Switching from an acoustic to a silent environment resulted in increased boldness and activity. We also looked at the effects of changes in the nonsocial environment via a physical disturbance that mimicked the presence of a potential predator (mechanical shaking). The effects of physical disturbance (and changes thereof) on behaviour were far less pronounced than the effects of changes in the social environment. Neither the repeatability of nor correlations between behaviours were affected by changes in physical disturbance. Only the average level of exploration was affected significantly when crickets were moved from an undisturbed to a disturbed environment, with crickets becoming less explorative. Although changes in the social and the nonsocial environment affected the repeatability of and correlations between some of the behaviours measured, changes in the social environment had the greater effect. We discuss the ecological and evolutionary implications of our findings and how they relate to our current understanding of social and nonsocial environmental effects on behaviour. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={This study investigates the complex roles of the social environment and genes in the multigenerational transmission of educational attainment. Drawing on genome-wide data and educational attainment measures from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), I conduct polygenic score analyses to examine genetic confounding in the estimation of parents’ and grandparents’ influences on their children’s and grandchildren’s educational attainment. I also examine social genetic effects (i.e., genetic effects that operate through the social environment) in the transmission of educational attainment across three generations. Two-generation analyses produce three important findings. First, about one-fifth of the parent-child association in education reflects genetic inheritance. Second, up to half of the association between parents’ polygenic scores and children’s education is mediated by parents’ education. Third, about one-third of the association between children’s polygenic scores and their educational attainment is attributable to parents’ genotypes and education. Three-generation analyses suggest that genetic confounding on the estimate of the direct effect of grandparents’ education on grandchildren’s education (net of parents’ education) may be inconsequential, and I find no evidence that grandparents’ genotypes significantly influence grandchildren’s education through non-biological pathways. The three-generation results are suggestive, and the results may change when different samples are used. © 2018, © American Sociological Association 2018.},

abstract={The social environment can dramatically influence the development and expression of individual behavior. Indirect genetic effects (IGE) arise when variation in the social environment depends on genotypic differences among social partners. Their role in generating variation and influencing evolutionary dynamics has become increasingly recognized in recent years, but less attention has been paid to how IGE arise during development. We measured the development of IGE using a discrete natural polymorphism in male coloration and associated behaviors in eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). We observed substantial IGE and direct genetic effects on behavior. For some behaviors, IGE changed and even reversed direction over the 16 weeks of the experiment, indicating important developmental dynamics. Interaction between IGE and direct genetic effects for some behaviors suggests that melanistic males were less responsive to a genetic change in their social environment than nonmelanistic males were. Alternately, social partners might vary less in the behavior they direct toward melanistic males. Color morphs differed in mating behavior and in aggressive behavior they received from social partners, but not in direct measures of aggression. Therefore, even apparently innate differences in behavior between morphs could arise as indirect effects of differences in behavior directed toward them by social partners. These results indicate that some differences attributed to melanism in this and other species might result from color morphs experiencing different social environments. Deducing the developmental and social origins of these indirect effects is therefore critical for understanding melanism-Associated behavioral variation in the many species in which it occurs. © The Author(s) 2017.

abstract={In genetic association studies, it is important to distinguish direct and indirect genetic effects in order to build truly functional models. For this purpose, we consider a directed acyclic graph setting with genetic variants, primary and intermediate phenotypes, and confounding factors. In order to make valid statistical inference on direct genetic effects on the primary phenotype, it is necessary to consider all potential effects in the graph, and we propose to use the estimating equations method with robust Huber–White sandwich standard errors. We evaluate the proposed causal inference based on estimating equations (CIEE) method and compare it with traditional multiple regression methods, the structural equation modeling method, and sequential G-estimation methods through a simulation study for the analysis of (completely observed) quantitative traits and time-to-event traits subject to censoring as primary phenotypes. The results show that CIEE provides valid estimators and inference by successfully removing the effect of intermediate phenotypes from the primary phenotype and is robust against measured and unmeasured confounding of the indirect effect through observed factors. All other methods except the sequential G-estimation method for quantitative traits fail in some scenarios where their test statistics yield inflated type I errors. In the analysis of the Genetic Analysis Workshop 19 dataset, we estimate and test genetic effects on blood pressure accounting for intermediate gene expression phenotypes. The results show that CIEE can identify genetic variants that would be missed by traditional regression analyses. CIEE is computationally fast, widely applicable to different fields, and available as an R package. © 2017 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.},

abstract={Background: Average daily gain (ADG) in pigs is affected by the so-called social (or indirect) genetic effects (SGE). However, SGE may differ between sexes because boars grow faster than gilts and their social behaviours differ. We hypothesized that direct genetic effects (DGE) and SGE for ADG in pigs differ between boars and gilts and that accounting for these differences will improve the predictive ability of a social genetic effects model (SGM). Our data consisted of ADG from 30 to 94 kg for 32,212 uncastrated males (boars) and 48,252 gilts that were raised in sex-specific pens. Data were analyzed using a univariate model with sex as a fixed effect and a bivariate model with ADG in boars and gilts as separate traits using both a classical animal model (CM) and a SGM. Results: With the univariate model, the heritability for ADG was 0.22 ± 0.01 for the CM, while the estimate of the total heritable variance (T2) was 0.23 ± 0.01 with the SGM. With the bivariate model, the genetic variance for SGE was higher for boars (13.8 ± 5.8) than for gilts (9.3 ± 3.9). For the bivariate model, T2 was 0.32 ± 0.02 for boars and 0.27 ± 0.01 for gilts. Estimates of the genetic correlations between DGE (0.88 ± 0.02) and SGE (0.30 ± 0.30) for boars versus gilts indicated that ADG in boars and gilts are different traits. Moreover, the estimate of the genetic correlation between DGE and SGE indicated presence of genetic effects of competition among gilts but not among boars. Compared to a CM, the univariate SGM improved predictive ability significantly only for gilts and the bivariate SGM improved predictive ability significantly for both boars and gilts. Conclusions: We found significant genetic variances of SGE for ADG. The covariance between DGE and SGE was much more negative for gilts than for boars when applying the bivariate model. Because the estimate of the genetic correlation for ADG between gilts and boars differed significantly from 1 and the predictive ability for boars and gilts was improved significantly with the bivariate model, we recommend the use of a bivariate model to estimate both SGE and DGE for ADG in pigs. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Genetic variation in resident species can influence the assembly and dynamics of communities, but the potential for these genetic effects to persist across generations is largely unresolved. In principle, persistent, directional changes in communities are only predicted when community properties covary genetically with the fitness of resident species. Estimates of genetic covariance between the fitness of a resident species and its community are therefore necessary to “close the eco-evolutionary loop” in studies of community genetics, but such estimates are rare. Emulating community genetics experiments in plants, we used clonal replicates of 21 genotypes of a resident species (the encrusting bryozoan, Hippopodina) to investigate the magnitude of genotypic variance contributing to assembly of a marine benthic community. Genotypes explained up to 35% of variation in community assembly. Critically, the performance of Hippopodina genotypes covaried both with the evenness of communities and with the abundances of some individual species, representing an indirect genetic effect that creates the potential for multigenerational interactions between Hippopodina and co-existing species. Our results suggest that different genotypes will associate with different community members consistently across generations, and such non-random associations can give rise to specialization. Further interactions between species other than Hippopodina itself may also be altered by effects of genetic variation in the focal species. Furthermore, species in the community other than Hippopodina itself will interact more commonly in the presence of some genotypes over others. Our results support the potential for genetic variation in one species to have deterministic effects on the dynamics of ecological communities.

abstract={Organisms express phenotypic plasticity during social interactions. Interacting phenotype theory has explored the consequences of social plasticity for evolution, but it is unclear how this theory applies to complex social structures. We adapt interacting phenotype models to general social structures to explore how the number of social connections between individuals and preference for phenotypically similar social partners affect phenotypic variation and evolution. We derive an analytical model that ignores phenotypic feedback and use simulations to test the predictions of this model. We find that adapting previous models to more general social structures does not alter their general conclusions but generates insights into the effect of social plasticity and social structure on the maintenance of phenotypic variation and evolution. Contribution of indirect genetic effects to phenotypic variance is highest when interactions occur at intermediate densities and decrease at higher densities, when individuals approach interacting with all group members, homogenizing the social environment across individuals. However, evolutionary response to selection tends to increase at greater network densities as the effects of an individual's genes are amplified through increasing effects on other group members. Preferential associations among similar individuals (homophily) increase both phenotypic variance within groups and evolutionary response to selection. Our results represent a first step in relating social network structure to the expression of social plasticity and evolutionary responses to selection. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Breeding site selection is often a joint decision of pair members in species with biparental care and the experience of both pair members may influence the use of information for site selection. Nevertheless, quantitative genetics of joint information use for site selection remains unexplored so far. We used an experimental approach to quantify the relative importance of genetics (heritability) and past experience (age, familiarity with the environment, previous breeding success, previous information use) in heterospecific social information use for nest site selection in wild collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis). Flycatchers collect social information from resident tits for nest site selection. We created an apparent preference of tits for a novel nest site feature and recorded choices of flycatchers (copying or rejecting the tit preference). Copying behavior was stronger for naive individuals but also differed between years, which could be explained by contrasting seasonality in the demonstrator species. Past experience as reflected by age affected subsequent use of social information: pairs with a yearling male were more likely to copy the heterospecific preference than pairs with older immigrant males. There was no general pattern in successive individual choices over the years. Accordingly, individual repeatability in copying tit preference was very low. At the pair level, we estimated sex-specific direct and indirect genetic effects on the joint nest site decision and found no sex-specific heritability and no cross-sex genetic correlation. Our results confirm the importance of past experience for social information use and suggest that social information use is highly plastic and most likely not genetically inherited in collared flycatchers. Whether individuals use social information should be related to environmentally-induced changes in the quality of information and thus be context-dependent. Selection may therefore act on the ability to optimally use social information in varying environments and on the processes underlying such adjustment, such as learning, rather than the use of information itself. © 2018 Morinay, Forsman, Kivelä, Gustafsson and Doligez.},

abstract={Humans tend to form social relationships with others who resemble them. Whether this sorting of like with like arises from historical patterns of migration, meso-level social structures in modern society, or individual-level selection of similar peers remains unsettled. Recent research has evaluated the possibility that unobserved genotypes may play an important role in the creation of homophilous relationships. We extend this work by using data from 5,500 adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to examine genetic similarities among pairs of friends. Although there is some evidence that friends have correlated genotypes, both at the whole-genome level as well as at trait-associated loci (via polygenic scores), further analysis suggests that meso-level forces, such as school assignment, are a principal source of genetic similarity between friends. We also observe apparent social–genetic effects in which polygenic scores of an individual’s friends and schoolmates predict the individual’s own educational attainment. In contrast, an individual’s height is unassociated with the height genetics of peers.},

An additive effect is the main genetic determinant of the phenotypic value of a quantitative trait, but it is a direct genetic effect (DGE) of the trait itself, ignoring the genetic influence of social interaction among individuals in the same group. The expression of genes of an individual has an influence on the phenotypic values of others in the same group, which is an indirect genetic effect (IGE). IGE is generated by social interaction among individuals in the group. IGE has been widely reported in animals and plants. For aquatic animals, IGE has been determined in Nile tilapia, Atlantic cod, and the Pacific white shrimp. The Chinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) is one of the most representative aquaculture species in China. In F. chinensis, cannibalism and frequent attacks are common phenomena. Attacks among individuals under environmental stress and the fight for food may affect the growth of shrimps. In order to study the indirect genetic effects of body weight in F. chinensis under restrictive feeding conditions, 103 families of the eleventh generation of the breeding population were tested using a multi-family by multi-group design. They were reared for about three months with limited feed and harvest body weight was measured for each individual. Genetic parameters of harvest body weight were estimated using an extended animal model, including IGE. The results showed that the IGE of body weight was significant, with a contribution to the total genetic variance reaching up to 75.03%. There was a negative covariance (-2.1900) between DGE and IGE. Based on the model with IGE, the ratio of total genetic variance to phenotypic variance was 0.524±0.212, which was less than the traditional estimate of heritability (0.616±0.074). In addition, there was a negative genetic correlation between the direct and indirect genetic effects (-0.495), implying that the existence of competitive effects may be detrimental to selective responses. This study demonstrated strong social interaction (competition among individuals) exists in a population of F. chinensis under restrictive feeding conditions, which had a heritable effect on body weight. Considering that the indirect genetic effect under the competitive environment has a greater negative impact on selection, it is inadvisable to conduct breeding programs under a competitive environment. © 2018 Journal of Fishery Sciences of China.},

abstract={Behavior is rapidly flexible and highly context-dependent, which poses obvious challenges to researchers attempting to dissect its causes. However, over a century of unresolved debate has also focused on whether the very flexibility and context-dependence of behavior lends it a unique role in the evolutionary origins and patterns of diversity in the Animal Kingdom. Here, we propose that both challenges can benefit from studying how indirect genetic effects (IGEs: the effects of genes expressed in one individual on traits in another individual) shape behavioral phenotypes. We provide a sketch of the theoretical framework that grounds IGEs in behavioral ecology research and focus on recent advances made from studies of IGEs in areas of behavioral ecology such as sexual selection, sexual conflict, social dominance, and parent-offspring interactions. There is mounting evidence that IGEs have important influences on behavioral phenotypes associated with these processes, such as sexual signals and preferences and behaviors which function to manipulate interacting partners. IGEs can also influence both responses to selection and selection itself, and considering IGEs refines evolutionary predictions and provides new perspectives on the origins of seemingly perplexing behavioral traits. A key unresolved question, but one that has dominated the behavioral sciences for over a century, is whether behavior is more likely than other types of traits to contribute to evolutionary change and diversification. We advocate taking advantage of an IGE approach to outline falsifiable hypotheses and a general methodology to rigorously test this frequently proposed, yet still contentious, special role of behavior in evolution. ©The Author(s) 2017.

abstract={Competition for resources including food, physical space, and potential mates is a fundamental ecological process shaping variation in individual phenotype and fitness. The evolution of competitive ability, in particular social dominance, depends on genetic (co)variation among traits causal (e.g., behavior) or consequent (e.g., growth) to competitive outcomes. If dominance is heritable, it will generate both direct and indirect genetic effects (IGE) on resource-dependent traits. The latter are expected to impose evolutionary constraint because winners necessarily gain resources at the expense of losers. We varied competition in a population of sheepshead swordtails, Xiphophorus birchmanni, to investigate effects on behavior, size, growth, and survival. We then applied quantitative genetic analyses to determine (i) whether competition leads to phenotypic and/or genetic integration of behavior with life history and (ii) the potential for IGE to constrain life history evolution. Size, growth, and survival were reduced at high competition. Male dominance was repeatable and dominant individuals show higher growth and survival. Additive genetic contributions to phenotypic covariance were significant, with the G matrix largely recapitulating phenotypic relationships. Social dominance has a low but significant heritability and is strongly genetically correlated with size and growth. Assuming causal dependence of growth on dominance, hidden IGE will therefore reduce evolutionary potential. © 2017 The Author(s). Evolution © 2017 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

abstract={Understanding micro-evolutionary responses of mating systems to contemporary selection requires estimating sex-specific additive genetic variances and cross-sex genetic covariances in key reproductive strategy traits. One key trait comprises the occurrence of divorce versus mate fidelity across sequential reproductive attempts. If divorce represents an evolving behav-ioural strategy that responds to selection it must have non-zero individual repeatability and heritability, but quantitative estimates from wild populations are scarce. We used 39 years of individual breeding records and pedigree data from free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to quantify sex-specific permanent individual and additive genetic variances, and hence estimate repeatability and heritability, in liability for divorce. We estimated moderate repeatability among females, but little repeatability among males. Estimates of additive genetic variance were small in both sexes, and the cross-sex genetic covariance was close to zero. Consequently, the total heritability was small but likely non-zero, indicating low potential for micro-evolutionary response to selection. Rapid micro-evolutionary change of divorce rate, therefore, appears unlikely, even if there were substantial fitness benefits of divorce and resulting selection. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Female post-mating behaviors are regulated by complex factors involving males, females, and the environment. In insects, plant secondary compounds that males actively forage for, may indirectly modify female behaviors by altering male behavior and physiology. In the tephritid fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni, females mated with males previously fed on plant-derived phenylpropa-noids (¼“lures” based on usage in tephritid literature), have longer mating refractoriness, greater fecundity, and reduced longevity than females mated with non-lure fed males. This system thus provides a model for studying transcriptional changes associated with those post-mating behaviors, as the genes regulating the phenotypic changes are likely to be expressed at a greater magnitude than in control females. We performed comparative transcriptome analyses using virgin B. tryoni females, females mated with control males (control-mated), and females mated with lure-fed males (lure-mated). We found 331 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in control-mated females and 80 additional DEGs in lure-mated females. Although DEGs in control-mated females are mostly immune response genes and chorion proteins, as reported in Drosophila species, DEGs in lure-mated females are titin-like muscle proteins, histones, sperm, and testis expressed proteins which have not been previously reported. While transcripts regulating mating (e.g., lingerer) did not show differential expression in either of the mated female classes, the odorant binding protein Obp56a was down-regulated. The exclusively enriched or suppressed genes in lure-mated females, novel transcripts such as titin and histones, and several taxa-specific transcripts reported here can shed more light on post-mating transcriptional changes, and this can help understand factors possibly regulating female post-mating behaviors. © The Author 2017.},

abstract={Understanding how genetic-based traits of plants interact with climate to affect associated communities will help improve predictions of climate change impacts on biodiversity. However, few community-level studies have addressed such interactions. Pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) in the southwestern U.S. shows genetic-based resistance and susceptibility to pinyon needle scale (Matsucoccus acalyptus). We sought to determine if susceptibility to scale herbivory influenced the diversity and composition of the extended community of 250+ arthropod species, and if this influence would be consistent across consecutive years, an extreme drought year followed by a moderate drought year. Because scale insects alter the architecture of susceptible trees, it is difficult to separate the direct influences of susceptibility on arthropod communities from the indirect influences of scale-altered tree architecture. To separate these influences, scales were experimentally excluded from susceptible trees for 15 years creating susceptible trees with the architecture of resistant trees, hereafter referred to as scale-excluded trees. Five patterns emerged. (1) In both years, arthropod abundance was 3-4X lower on susceptible trees compared to resistant and scale-excluded trees. (2) Species accumulation curves show that alpha and gamma diversity were 2-3X lower on susceptible trees compared to resistant and scale-excluded trees. (3) Reaction norms of arthropod richness and abundance on individual tree genotypes across years showed genotypic variation in the community response to changes in climate. (4) The genetic-based influence of susceptibility on arthropod community composition is climate dependent. During extreme drought, community composition on scale-excluded trees resembled susceptible trees indicating composition was strongly influenced by tree genetics independent of tree architecture. However, under moderate drought, community composition on scale-excluded trees resembled resistant trees indicating traits associated with tree architecture became more important. (5) One year after extreme drought, the arthropod community rebounded sharply. However, there was a much greater rebound in richness and abundance on resistant compared to susceptible trees suggesting that reduced resiliency in the arthropod community is associated with susceptibility. These results argue that individual genetic-based plant-herbivore interactions can directly and indirectly impact community-level diversity, which is modulated by climate. Understanding such interactions is important for assessing the impacts of climate change on biodiversity. © 2018 Stone, Gehring, Cobb and Whitham.},

abstract={Behaviour is the interface between an organism and its environment, and behavioural plasticity is important for organisms to cope with environmental change. Social behaviour is particularly important because sociality is a dynamic process, where environmental variation influences group dynamics and social plasticity can mediate resource acquisition. Heterogeneity in the ecological environment can therefore influence the social environment. The combination of the ecological and social environments may be interpreted collectively as the “socioecological environment,” which could explain variation in fitness. Our objective was to outline a framework through which individual social and spatial phenotypes can be integrated and interpreted as phenotypes that covary as a function of changes in the socioecological environment. We propose the socioecological environment is composed of individual behavioural traits, including sociality and habitat selection, both of which are repeatable, potentially heritable and may reflect animal personality traits. We also highlight how ecological and social niche theory can be applied to the socioecological environment framework, where individuals occupy different socioecological niches. Individual sociality and habitat selection are also density-dependent, and theory predicts that density-dependent traits should affect reproduction, survival, and therefore fitness and population dynamics. We then illustrate the proximate links between sociality, habitat selection and fitness as well as the ultimate, and possibly adaptive, consequences associated with changes in population density. The ecological, evolutionary and applied implications of our proposed socioecological environment framework are broad and changes in density could influence individual fitness and population dynamics. For instance, human-induced environmental changes can influence population density, which can affect the distribution of social and spatial phenotypes within a population. In summary, we outline a conceptual framework that incorporates individual social and spatial behavioural traits with fitness and we highlight a range of ecological and evolutionary processes that are likely associated with the socioecological environment. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={The immune system is genetically controlled and responsible for population heterogeneity on the immune response. The aim of the article is to analyze molecular mechanisms of cell-mediated and antibody-mediated immune response and molecular markers for genomic selection. Genotypic differences between individuals in terms of tolerance/susceptibility to infectious diseases are characteristic of animal populations (S.C. Bishop et al., 2014). Data massive indicates multiple SNPs associated with high and low immune responses of animals, providing the possibility of calculating the coefficients of genomic breeding values for this attribute. There is a need to assess the dispersion of indirect genetic effects that help to open up new possibilities for the control of infectious diseases through selection. However, it should be noted that the quantitative genetic analysis based on individual animal disease status covers only part of the total genetic variation that affects the dynamics of infectious diseases in populations. Estimation of gene expression patterns in a particular immune response is considered as the most valuable (V.V. Firstova et al., 2010). Study of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC-B) 209296 bp region in birds with high-density SNP chips allowed the authors to determine 45 key genes which affect MHC-B diversity through recombination. The findings extend the understanding of the contribution of recombination to the diversity of MHC-B haplotypes, including the ability to identify hot spots and recombination estimation of recombination frequency (J.E. Fulton et al., 2016). The causative mutations related to the basic genetic variability of innate and adaptive immune responses in chickens are mapped (A. Slawinska et al., 2013). Search for causal mutations responsible for genetic variation in the immune response can be used as an approach to diagnostic tests. E.g., SNP associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis are detected (M.L. Bermingham et al., 2014). Immune response falls into a category of complex and quantitative traits that are under control of multiple genes with a noticeable influence of the environment. Obviously, some genes of common universal action may participate in innate and adaptive immunity. We can assume that such immunity has predominantly additive mode of inheritance (M. Siwek et al., 2015). Breeding for diseases resistance is greatly difficult because of low heritability and lack of estimates for comprehensive genetic assessment of the disease resistance variability. Growing genomic evaluations of the animals has created a basis for the use of molecular markers in breeding to increase animal resistance to diseases. Studies of the genome and the overall adaptive immune response associations in different species of farm animals provide an important starting point for the implementation of such plans. Identification of potential biological pathways and genes associated with immune response can assist in advancing the understanding of the important processes in animal resistance or susceptibility to diseases. © 2018 Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

We compare Ψ for locomotion between ethanol and nonethanol environments in both species, but only D. melanogaster utilizes ethanol ecologically. We find that while sexual dimorphism for locomotion has been reversed in D. simulans, there has been no evolution of social effects between these two species. What did evolve was the interaction between genotype-specific Ψ and the environment, as D. melanogaster varies unpredictably between environments and D. simulans does not. In this system, this suggests evolutionary lability of sexual dimorphism but a conservation of social effects, which brings forth interesting questions about the role of the social environment in sexual selection. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Behavioural ecology research increasingly focuses on why genetic behavioural variation can persist despite selection. Evolutionary theory predicts that directional selection leads to evolutionary change while depleting standing genetic variation. Nevertheless, evolutionary stasis may occur for traits involved in social interactions. This requires tight negative genetic correlations between direct genetic effects (DGEs) of an individual's genes on its own phenotype and the indirect genetic effects (IGEs) it has on conspecifics, as this could diminish the amount of genetic variation available to selection to act upon. We tested this prediction using a pedigreed laboratory population of Mediterranean field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus), in which both exploratory tendency and aggression are heritable. We found that genotypes predisposed to be aggressive (due to DGEs) strongly decreased aggressiveness in opponents (due to IGEs). As a consequence, the variance in total breeding values was reduced to almost zero, implying that IGEs indeed greatly contribute to the occurrence of evolutionary stasis. IGEs were further associated with genetic variation in a non-social behaviour: explorative genotypes elicited most aggression in opponents. These key findings imply that IGEs indeed represent an important overlooked mechanism that can impact evolutionary dynamics of traits under selection. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={The social environment is both an important agent of selection for most organisms, and an emergent property of their interactions. As an aggregation of interactions among members of a population, the social environment is a product of many sets of relationships and so can be represented as a network or matrix. Social network analysis in animals has focused on why these networks possess the structure they do, and whether individuals’ network traits, representing some aspect of their social phenotype, relate to their fitness. Meanwhile, quantitative geneticists have demonstrated that traits expressed in a social context can depend on the phenotypes and genotypes of interacting partners, leading to influences of the social environment on the traits and fitness of individuals and the evolutionary trajectories of populations. Therefore, both fields are investigating similar topics, yet have arrived at these points relatively independently. We review how these approaches are diverged, and yet how they retain clear parallelism and so strong potential for complementarity. This demonstrates that, despite separate bodies of theory, advances in one might inform the other. Techniques in network analysis for quantifying social phenotypes, and for identifying community structure, should be useful for those studying the relationship between individual behaviour and group-level phenotypes. Entering social association matrices into quantitative genetic models may also reduce bias in heritability estimates, and allow the estimation of the influence of social connectedness on trait expression. Current methods for measuring natural selection in a social context explicitly account for the fact that a trait is not necessarily the property of a single individual, something the network approaches have not yet considered when relating network metrics to individual fitness. Harnessing evolutionary models that consider traits affected by genes in other individuals (i.e. indirect genetic effects) provides the potential to understand how entire networks of social interactions in populations influence phenotypes and predict how these traits may evolve. By theoretical integration of social network analysis and quantitative genetics, we hope to identify areas of compatibility and incompatibility and to direct research efforts towards the most promising areas. Continuing this synthesis could provide important insights into the evolution of traits expressed in a social context and the evolutionary consequences of complex and nuanced social phenotypes. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

abstract={Family members show behavioural strategies predicted to maximize individual fitness. These behaviours depend directly on genes expressed in focal individuals but also indirectly on genes expressed in other family members. However, how sibling and parental behavioural strategies are modified by genes expressed in family members, and to what degree, remains unclear. To answer this question, we have used a split litter design in an experimental population of genetically variable mouse families, and identified loci that indirectly affected sibling and maternal behaviour simultaneously. These loci map to genomic regions that also show a direct effect on offspring behaviour. Directly and indirectly affected traits were significantly correlated at the phenotypic level, illustrating how indirect effects are caused. Genetic variants in offspring that influence solicitation also impacted their siblings’ and maternal behaviour. However, in contrast to predictions from sibling competition, unrelated litter mates benefited from increased solicitation. Overall, such indirect genetic effects explained a large proportion of variation seen in behaviours, with candidate genes involved in metabolism to neuronal development. These results reveal that we need to view behavioural strategies as the result of conjoint selection on genetic variation in all interacting family members. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Despite essential progress towards understanding the evolution of cooperative behaviour, we still lack detailed knowledge about its underlying molecular mechanisms, genetic basis, evolutionary dynamics and ontogeny. An international workshop “Genetics and Development of Cooperation,” organized by the University of Bern (Switzerland), aimed at discussing the current progress in this research field and suggesting avenues for future research. This review uses the major themes of the meeting as a springboard to synthesize the concepts of genetic and nongenetic inheritance of cooperation, and to review a quantitative genetic framework that allows for the inclusion of indirect genetic effects. Furthermore, we argue that including nongenetic inheritance, such as transgenerational epigenetic effects, parental effects, ecological and cultural inheritance, provides a more nuanced view of the evolution of cooperation. We summarize those genes and molecular pathways in a range of species that seem promising candidates for mechanisms underlying cooperative behaviours. Concerning the neurobiological substrate of cooperation, we suggest three cognitive skills necessary for the ability to cooperate: (i) event memory, (ii) synchrony with others and (iii) responsiveness to others. Taking a closer look at the developmental trajectories that lead to the expression of cooperative behaviours, we discuss the dichotomy between early morphological specialization in social insects and more flexible behavioural specialization in cooperatively breeding vertebrates. Finally, we provide recommendations for which biological systems and species may be particularly suitable, which specific traits and parameters should be measured, what type of approaches should be followed, and which methods should be employed in studies of cooperation to better understand how cooperation evolves and manifests in nature. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={An individual's genes may influence the phenotype of neighboring conspecifics. Such indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are important as they can affect the apparent total heritable variance in a population, and thus the response to selection. We studied these effects in a large, pedigreed population of Eucalyptus globulus using variance component analyses of Mycosphearella leaf disease, diameter growth at age 2 years, and post-infection diameter growth at ages 4 and 8 years. In a novel approach, we initially modeled IGEs using a factor analytic (FA) structure to identify the most influential neighbor positions, with the FA loadings being position-specific regressions on the IGEs. This involved sequentially comparing FA models for the variance-covariance matrices of the direct and indirect effects of each neighbor. We then modeled IGEs as a distance-based, combined effect of the most influential neighbors. This often increased the magnitude and significance of indirect genetic variance estimates relative to using all neighbors. The extension of a univariate IGEs model to bivariate analyses also provided insights into the genetic architecture of this population, revealing that: (1) IGEs arising from increased probability of neighbor infection were not associated with reduced growth of neighbors, despite adverse fitness effects being evident at the direct genetic level; and (2) the strong, genetic-based competitive interactions for growth, established early in stand development, were highly positively correlated over time. Our results highlight the complexities of genetic-based interactions at the multi-trait level due to (co)variances associated with IGEs, and the marked discrepancy occurring between direct and total heritable variances. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

abstract={Background: Most rabbit production farms apply feed restriction at fattening because of its protective effect against digestive diseases that affect growing rabbits. However, it leads to competitive behaviour between cage mates, which is not observed when animals are fed ad libitum. Our aim was to estimate the contribution of direct (d d) and social (s s) genetic effects (also known as indirect genetic effects) to total heritable variance of average daily gain (ADG) in rabbits on different feeding regimens (FR), and the magnitude of the interaction between genotype and FR (G × FR). Methods: A total of 6264 contemporary kits were housed in cages of eight individuals and raised on full (F F) or restricted (R R) feeding to 75% of the ad libitum intake. A Bayesian analysis of weekly records of ADG ADG (from 32 to 60 days of age) in rabbits on F F and R R was performed with a two-trait model including d d and s s. Results: The ratio between total heritable variance and phenotypic variance T2 was low (&lt;0.10) and did not differ significantly between FR. However, the ratio between h 2 (i.e. variance of d d relative to phenotypic variance) and T 2 was ∼0.52 and 0.86 for animals on R R and F F, respectively, thus s s contributed more to the heritable variance of animals on R R than on F F. Feeding regimen also affected the sign and magnitude of the correlation between d d and s s, i.e. -0.5 and ∼0 for animals on R R and F F, respectively. The posterior mean (posterior sd) of the correlation between estimated total breeding values (ETBV) of animals on R R and F F was 0.26 (0.20), indicating very strong G × FR interactions. The correlations between d d and s s in rabbits on F F and R R ranged from -0.47 (d d on F F and s s on R R) to 0.64. Conclusions: Our results suggest that selection of rabbits for ADG ADG under F F may completely fail to improve ADG ADG in rabbits on R R. Social genetic effects contribute substantially to ETBV of rabbits on R R but not on F F. Selection for ADG ADG should be performed under production conditions regarding the FR, by accounting for s s if the amount of food is limited. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Genotype by genotype indirect genetic effects (G × G IGEs) occur when the phenotype of an individual is influenced by an interaction between its own genotype and those of neighbour individuals. Little is known regarding the relative importance of G × G IGEs compared with other forms of direct and indirect genetic effects. We quantified the relative importance of IGEs in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, a species in which IGEs are likely to be important as air-borne social interactions are known to affect growth. We used a collection of distantly related wild isolates, lab strains and a set of closely related mutation accumulation lines to estimate the contribution of direct and indirect genetic effects on mycelium growth rate, a key fitness component. We found that indirect genetic effects were dominated by G × G IGEs that occurred primarily between a focal genotype and its immediate neighbour within a vertical stack, and these accounted for 11% of phenotypic variation. These results indicate that G × G IGEs may be substantial, at least in some systems, and that the evolutionary importance of these interactions may be underappreciated, especially in microbes. We advocate for a wider use of the IGE framework in both applied (for example, choice of varietal mixtures in plant breeding) and evolutionary genetics (kin selection/kin competition studies). © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

abstract={Despite strong purifying or directional selection, variation is ubiquitous in populations. One mechanism for the maintenance of variation is indirect genetic effects (IGEs), as the fitness of a given genotype will depend somewhat on the genes of its social partners. IGEs describe the effect of genes in social partners on the expression of the phenotype of a focal individual. Here, we ask what effect IGEs, and variation in IGEs between abiotic environments, has on locomotion in Drosophila. This trait is known to be subject to intralocus sexually antagonistic selection. We estimate the coefficient of interaction, Ψ, using six inbred lines of Drosophila. We found that Ψ varied between abiotic environments, and that it may vary across among male genotypes in an abiotic environment specific manner. We also found evidence that social effects of males alter the value of a sexually dimorphic trait in females, highlighting an interesting avenue for future research into sexual antagonism. We conclude that IGEs are an important component of social and sexual interactions and that they vary between individuals and abiotic environments in complex ways, with the potential to promote the maintenance of phenotypic variation. © 2017 The Author(s).

abstract={A useful interpretation of quantitative genetic models of evolutionary change is that they (i) define a set of phenotypes that have a causal effect on fitness and on which selection acts, and (ii) define a set of breeding values that change as a correlated response to that selection because they covary with the phenotypes. When the expression of one trait causes variation in other traits then there are multiple paths by which a trait can cause fitness variation. Because of this, there are multiple ways in which selection can be defined, and still be consistent with a causal effect of traits on fitness. We use this result to show that genetical theories of natural/kin selection ignore causation and because of this we suggest they shed little light on the nature of selection. When traits expressed by an individual are affected by traits of their social partners (indirect genetic effects), we suggest a causal partitioning that allows selection to be cast in terms of Hamilton's costs and benefits. We show that previous attempts to understand Hamilton's rule in the context of indirect genetic effects either lack generality, or do not adequately describe all the ways in which an individual's actions constitute a cost to the individual or a benefit to its social partner(s). Our results allow us to explore Hamilton's rule in a multitrait setting. We show that evolution always increases inclusive fitness, and when the traits are measured in units of generalised genetic distance evolutionary change in the traits is in the direction in which inclusive fitness increases the fastest. However, we show that Hamilton's rule only holds in a multitrait context when the suite of traits are at equilibrium. When they are out of equilibrium, the conditions for altruism to evolve may be more or less stringent depending on genetic architecture and how costs and benefits are defined. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Social interactions among individuals are abundant, both in natural and domestic populations, and may affect phenotypes of individuals. Recent research has demonstrated that the social effect of an individual on the phenotype of its social partners may have a genetic component, known as an indirect genetic effect (IGE). Little is known, however, of nongenetic factors underlying such social effects. Early-life environments often have large effects on phenotypes of the individuals themselves later in life. Offspring development in many mammalian species, for example, depends on interactions with the mother and siblings. In domestic pigs, individuals sharing the same juvenile environment develop similar body weight later in life. We, therefore, hypothesized that offspring originating from the same early-life environment also develop common social skills that generate early-life social effects (ELSEs) that affect the phenotypes of their social partners later in life. We, therefore, quantified IGEs and ELSEs on growth in domestic pigs. Results show that individuals from the same early-life environment express similar social effects on the growth of their social partners, and that such ELSEs shape the growth rate of social partners more than IGEs. Thus, the social skills that individuals develop in early life have a long-lasting impact on the phenotypes of social partners. Early-life and genetic social effects were independent of the corresponding direct effects of offspring on their own growth, indicating that individuals may enhance the growth of their social partners without a personal cost. Our findings also illustrate how research devoted to quantifying IGEs may miss nongenetic and potentially confounded social mechanisms which may bias the estimates of IGEs. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The social environment modulates gene expression, physiology, behaviour and patterns of inheritance. For more than 50 years, this concept has been investigated using approaches that include partitioning the social component out of behavioural heritability estimates, studying maternal effects on offspring, and analysing dominance hierarchies. Recent advances have formalized this ‘social environment effect’ by providing a more nuanced approach to the study of social influences on behaviour while recognizing evolutionary implications. Yet, in most of these formulations, the dynamics of social interactions are not accounted for. Also, the reciprocity between individual behaviour and group-level interactions has been largely ignored. Consistent with evolutionary theory, the principles of social interaction are conserved across a broad range of taxa. While noting parallels in diverse organisms, this review uses Drosophila melanogaster as a case study to revisit what is known about social interaction paradigms. We highlight the benefits of integrating the history and pattern of interactions among individuals for dissecting molecular mechanisms that underlie social modulation of behaviour. © 2016 The Authors.},

abstract={Female mate choice is a complex decision-making process that involves many context-dependent factors. In Drosophila melanogaster, a model species for the study of sexual selection, indirect genetic effects (IGEs) of general social interactions can influence female mate choice behaviors, but the potential impacts of IGEs associated with mating experiences are poorly understood. Here, we examined whether the IGEs associated with a previous mating experience had an effect on subsequent female mate choice behaviors and quantified the degree of additive genetic variation associated with this effect. Females from 21 different genetic backgrounds were housed with males from one of two distinct genetic backgrounds for either a short (3 hr) or long (48 hr) exposure period and their subsequent mate choice behaviors were scored. We found that the genetic identity of a previous mate significantly influenced a female's subsequent interest in males and preference of males. Additionally, a hemiclonal analysis revealed significant additive genetic variation associated with experience-dependent mate choice behaviors, indicating a genotype-by-environment interaction for both of these parameters. We discuss the significance of these results with regard to the evolution of plasticity in female mate choice behaviors and the maintenance of variation in harmful male traits. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={The expression of an individual's phenotypic traits can be influenced by genes expressed in its social partners. Theoretical models predict that such indirect genetic effects (IGEs) on reproductive traits should play an important role in determining the evolutionary outcome of sexual conflict. However, empirical tests of (i) whether reproductive IGEs exist, (ii) how they vary among genotypes, and (iii) whether they are uniform for different types of reproductive traits are largely lacking. We addressed this in a series of experiments in the simultaneously hermaphroditic flatworm Macrostomum lignano. We found strong evidence for IGEs on both morphological and behavioral reproductive traits. Partner genotype had a significant impact on the testis size of focal individuals—varying up to 2.4-fold—suggesting that IGEs could mediate sexual conflicts that target the male sex function. We also found that time to first copulation was affected by a genotype × genotype interaction between mating partners, and that partner genotype affected the propensity to copulate and perform the postcopulatory suck behavior, which may mediate conflicts over the fate of received ejaculate components. These findings provide clear empirical evidence for IGEs on multiple behavioral and morphological reproductive traits, which suggests that the evolutionary dynamics of these traits could be altered by genes contained in the social environment. © 2017 The Author(s).

abstract={Male secondary sexual traits and female mate choice traits must contain heritable variation for sexual selection to operate. However, for female mate choice, especially, this is poorly known. To complicate matters, both male sexual traits and female mate choice typically show condition dependence, implying that environmental effects probably play an important synergistic role. Using a cross-fostering design, we therefore aimed to disentangle genetic, environmental and their potential interacting effects to investigate how they affect the expression of a sexually selected trait (here birdsong) and female mate choice. To assess environmental effects, we focused on the role of the social environment and thus on learned components. Among the different male song traits investigated, we found a high heritability for song bout length and song bout repertoire, as well as an intriguing gene-by-environment interaction for song bout repertoire. Specifically, the tutor appeared to negatively affect the song bout repertoire of the tutee when his genetic father had a large song bout repertoire but had a positive effect on descendants from fathers with small song bout repertoires. In contrast, we did not detect significant heritability in female mate choice. Female mate choice contained a learned component as females significantly disfavoured their foster father in the mate choice tests, indicating a learned inbreeding avoidance. Thus, our study provides important insights into the role of the social environment for both birdsong and female mate choice. However, the absence of a heritable component in female mate choice suggests a need for studies investigating the heritability of female preferences for (heritable) male song traits in order to gain a better understanding of a potential coevolution between male sexual traits and female mate choice. Overall, our results suggest that indirect genetic effects acting during the pre- and postfledging social contexts may play a prominent role in sexual selection. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Species exhibiting colour polymorphism are thought to have an ecological advantage at the landscape scale, because spatial segregation of alternatively adapted ecotypes into diverse habitats can increase the species' niche breadth and thus confer greater geographic range size. However, morph frequencies are also influenced by intrapopulational processes such as frequency- or density-dependent social interactions. To identify how social feedback may affect clinal variation in morph frequencies, we investigated reciprocal interactions between morph-specific thermal tolerance, local climatic conditions and social environments, in the context of a colour-morph frequency cline associated with a recent range expansion in blue-tailed damselflies (Ischnura elegans) in Sweden. Cold tolerances of gynochromes (female-like female morph) were positively correlated with local gynochrome frequencies, suggesting a positive frequency-dependent fitness benefit. In contrast, androchrome (male-mimic female morph) cold tolerances were improved following recent exposure to cold weather, suggesting a beneficial environmental acclimation effect. Thus, according to an environment-matching hypothesis for clinal variation, androchrome frequencies should therefore increase towards the (cooler) range limit. In contrast to this prediction, gynochrome frequencies increased at the expanding range limit, consistent with a positive frequency-dependent social feedback that is beneficial when invading novel climates. Our results suggest that when phenotypes or fitnesses are affected by interactions with conspecifics, beneficial social effects on environmental tolerances may (i) facilitate range shifts, and (ii) reverse or counteract typical patterns of intraspecific interactions and environment-matching clines observed in stable populations observed over broader geographic scales. © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.

abstract={Mortality of laying hens due to cannibalism is a major problem in the egg-laying industry. Survival depends on two genetic effects: the direct genetic effect of the individual itself (DGE) and the indirect genetic effects of its group mates (IGE). For hens housed in sire-family groups, DGE and IGE cannot be estimated using pedigree information, but the combined effect of DGE and IGE is estimated in the total breeding value (TBV). Genomic information provides information on actual genetic relationships between individuals and might be a tool to improve TBV accuracy. We investigated whether genomic information of the sire increased TBV accuracy compared with pedigree information, and we estimated genetic parameters for survival time. A sire model with pedigree information (BLUP) and a sire model with genomic information (ssGBLUP) were used. We used survival time records of 7290 crossbred offspring with intact beaks from four crosses. Cross-validation was used to compare the models. Using ssGBLUP did not improve TBV accuracy compared with BLUP which is probably due to the limited number of sires available per cross (~50). Genetic parameter estimates were similar for BLUP and ssGBLUP. For both BLUP and ssGBLUP, total heritable variance (T2), expressed as a proportion of phenotypic variance, ranged from 0.03 ± 0.04 to 0.25 ± 0.09. Further research is needed on breeding value estimation for socially affected traits measured on individuals kept in single-family groups. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Assessing the impact of the social environment on health and disease is challenging. As social effects are in part determined by the genetic makeup of social partners, they can be studied from associations between genotypes of one individual and phenotype of another (social genetic effects, SGE, also called indirect genetic effects). For the first time we quantified the contribution of SGE to more than 100 organismal phenotypes and genome-wide gene expression measured in laboratory mice. We find that genetic variation in cage mates (i.e. SGE) contributes to variation in organismal and molecular measures related to anxiety, wound healing, immune function, and body weight. Social genetic effects explained up to 29% of phenotypic variance, and for several traits their contribution exceeded that of direct genetic effects (effects of an individual’s genotypes on its own phenotype). Importantly, we show that ignoring SGE can severely bias estimates of direct genetic effects (heritability). Thus SGE may be an important source of “missing heritability” in studies of complex traits in human populations. In summary, our study uncovers an important contribution of the social environment to phenotypic variation, sets the basis for using SGE to dissect social effects, and identifies an opportunity to improve studies of direct genetic effects. © 2017 Baud et al.},

abstract={Most animal species are social in one form or another, yet many studies in rodent model systems use either individually housed animals or ignore potential confounds caused by group housing. While such social interaction effects on developmental and behavioral traits are well established, the genetic basis of social interactions has not been researched in as much detail. Specifically, the effects of genetic variation in social partners on the phenotype of a focal individual have mostly been studied at the phenotypic level. Such indirect genetic effects (IGEs), where the genotype of one individual influences the phenotype of a second individual, can have important evolutionary and medically relevant consequences. In this chapter, we give a brief outline of social interaction effects, and how systems genetics approaches using recombinant inbred populations can be used to investigate indirect genetic effects specifically, including maternal genetic effects. We discuss experimental designs for the study of IGEs and show how indirect genetic loci can be identified that underlie social interaction effects, their mechanisms, and consequences for trait variation in focal individuals. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2017.},

abstract={Social genetic effects (SGE) are genetic effects of an individual that affect the phenotype of its social partners. We determined the reproductive consequences of selection for SGE on growth in pigs. To investigate the influence of social genetic effects on growth, gilts were divided into two groups based on their estimated SGE: positive SGE sows (+SGE) and negative SGE sows (-SGE). At the time of selection, gilts were contemporaries and similarly managed. We recorded the reproductive performance of the two groups based on parity until culling. Reproductive performance included the total number of piglets born (TNB), number of piglets born alive (NBA), average piglet birth weight (BW), coefficient of variation for birth weight (CVBW), age at first farrowing (AFF), weaning to estrus interval (WEI), and gestation length (GL). TNB was 0.5 higher for +SGE sows (13.8) than for -SGE sows (P = 0.03, SEM = 0.06), and NBA exhibited a higher tendency in +SGE sows (P = 0.07, SEM = 0.06). Positive SGE for growth was expressed at an earlier AFF (P = 0.04, SEM = 1.10), and shorter WEI (P < 0.01, SEM = 0.08) and GL (P = 0.03, SEM = 0.03). Collectively, the results of this study highlight the opportunities to improve litter size, the age at first farrowing, gestation length, and weaning to estrus interval using SGE.},

abstract={Models of cooperation among nonkin suggest that social assortment is important for the evolution of cooperation. Theory predicts that interacting phenotypes, whereby an individual’s behavior depends on the behavior of its social partners, can drive such social assortment. We measured repeated indirect genetic effects (IGEs) during cooperative predator inspection in eight populations of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) that vary in their evolutionary history of predation. Four broad patterns emerged that were dependent on river, predation history, and sex: (i) current partner behavior had the largest effect on focal behavior, with fish from low-predation habitats responding more to their social partners than fish from high-predation habitats; (ii) different focal/partner behavior combinations can generate cooperation; (iii) some high-predation fish exhibited carryover effects across social partners; and (iv) high-predation fish were more risk averse. These results provide the first large-scale comparison of interacting phenotypes during cooperation across wild animal populations, highlighting the potential importance of IGEs in maintaining cooperation. Intriguingly, while focal fish responded strongly to current social partners, carryover effects between social partners suggest generalized reciprocity (in which one helps anyone if helped by someone) may contribute to the evolution of cooperation in some, but not all, populations of guppies. © 2017 by The University of Chicago. 0003-0147/2017/18906-56634$15.00.

abstract={Organizational processes during prenatal development can have long-term effects on an individual’s phenotype. Because these early developmental stages are sensitive to environmental influences,mothers are in a unique position to alter their offspring’s phenotype by differentially allocating resources to their developing young. However,such prenatal maternal effects are difficult to disentangle from other forms of parental care,additive genetic effects,and/or other forms of maternal inheritance,hampering our understanding of their evolutionary consequences. Here we used divergent selection lines for high and low prenatal maternal investment and their reciprocal line crosses in a precocial bird—the Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica)—to quantify the relative importance of genes and prenatal maternal effects in shaping offspring phenotype. Maternal but not paternal origin strongly affected offspring body size and survival throughout development. Although the effects of maternal egg investment faded over time,they were large at key life stages. Additionally,there was evidence for other forms of maternal inheritance affecting offspring phenotype at later stages of development. Our study is among the first to successfully disentangle prenatal maternal effects from all other sources of confounding variation and highlights the important role of prenatal maternal provisioning in shaping offspring traits closely linked to fitness. © 2016 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={(Co)variance matrices for the assumed model, and thus the specification of the dispersion parameters, should take into account both the negative competition and the positive spatial correlations. In this context, we applied several approaches to identify and quantify the genetic and environmental competition effects and/or environmental heterogeneity in three Douglas-fir genetic trials from the British Columbia tree improvement program in total height and diameter at breast height at ages 12 and 35. Then, we applied an individual-tree mixed model to account jointly for competition effects and environmental heterogeneity (competition + spatial mixed model, CSM). We also compared the resulting estimates of all dispersion parameters and breeding values (BVs) with corresponding estimates from three simpler mixed models. Our analysis revealed that strong spatial environmental variation (predominantly at large-scale) covered the effects of competition in the three Douglas-fir progeny trials. While diameter at breast height at age 35 revealed strong competition effects at both genetic and environmental levels, these effects were not as strong for total height. In general, with strong competition genetic effects, the CSM gave a better fit than the simpler models. Ignoring competition effects and environmental heterogeneity resulted in lower additive genetic variances and higher residual variances than those estimated from the CSM. Ignoring competition effects leads to overestimating environmental heterogeneity, while ignoring the environmental heterogeneity leads to underestimating competition effects. Spearman correlations between BVs predicted from the simplest model and total BVs from the CSM were moderate to high. The implications of all these findings for the genetic improvement of coastal Douglas-fir in British Columbia are discussed. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Social interactions among animals are general phenomena in domestic populations. However,at present,very little is known about the contribution of social effect to the selection efficiency of long-term response. In this study,the selection efficiency of a socially affected trait with different social effect was investigated in a closed nucleus population using stochastic simulation. Some key factors that affect selection efficiency of genetic social effect were also compared. The results showed social effect played an important role in a longer term breeding programme even though social effect had a small effect on the trait of interest. The percentage of expected total response contributed by social effect was up to 15.27 at the end generation under a very low level of social effect (0.3% direct phenotypic variance). The full model with direct and social genetic effect,improved the selection efficiency of social effect and resulted in 4.89,5.21 and 2.70% more total cumulative selection response than the reduced model,without social effect,under the social effect size of 0.3,1 and 10% direct phenotypic variance,respectively. The social effect size and group member number showed more effect on the selection efficiency of social effect than other factors. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Quantifying direct and indirect genetic effects of interacting females and males on variation in jointly expressed life-history traits is central to predicting microevolutionary dynamics. However, accurately estimating sex-specific additive genetic variances in such traits remains difficult in wild populations, especially if related individuals inhabit similar fine-scale environments. Breeding date is a key life-history trait that responds to environmental phenology and mediates individual and population responses to environmental change. However, no studies have estimated female (direct) and male (indirect) additive genetic and inbreeding effects on breeding date, and estimated the cross-sex genetic correlation, while simultaneously accounting for fine-scale environmental effects of breeding locations, impeding prediction of microevolutionary dynamics. We fitted animal models to 38 years of song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) phenology and pedigree data to estimate sex-specific additive genetic variances in breeding date, and the cross-sex genetic correlation, thereby estimating the total additive genetic variance while simultaneously estimating sex-specific inbreeding depression. We further fitted three forms of spatial animal model to explicitly estimate variance in breeding date attributable to breeding location, overlap among breeding locations and spatial autocorrelation. We thereby quantified fine-scale location variances in breeding date and quantified the degree to which estimating such variances affected the estimated additive genetic variances. The non-spatial animal model estimated nonzero female and male additive genetic variances in breeding date (sex-specific heritabilities: 0·07 and 0·02, respectively) and a strong, positive cross-sex genetic correlation (0·99), creating substantial total additive genetic variance (0·18). Breeding date varied with female, but not male inbreeding coefficient, revealing direct, but not indirect, inbreeding depression. All three spatial animal models estimated small location variance in breeding date, but because relatedness and breeding location were virtually uncorrelated, modelling location variance did not alter the estimated additive genetic variances. Our results show that sex-specific additive genetic effects on breeding date can be strongly positively correlated, which would affect any predicted rates of microevolutionary change in response to sexually antagonistic or congruent selection. Further, we show that inbreeding effects on breeding date can also be sex specific and that genetic effects can exceed phenotypic variation stemming from fine-scale location-based variation within a wild population. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={The social environment of an animal is an especially interesting component of its environment because it can be shaped by both genetic and non-genetic variation among social partners. Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are those created when genetic variation in social partners contributes to variation in an individual's phenotype; a potentially common form of IGE occurs when the expression of a behavioral phenotype depends on the particular genotypic combination of interacting individuals. Although IGEs can profoundly affect individual- and group-level fitness, population dynamics, and even community structure, understanding their importance is complicated by two inherent challenges: (1) identifying individuals with genetic differences in social interactions that can contribute to IGEs and (2) characterizing natural social interactions that potentially involve IGEs. As a first step toward addressing both these challenges in the same system, we investigated social interactions involving genetically distinct male color morphs in the poeciliid fish Gambusia holbrooki under natural and laboratory conditions. Previous work indicates that melanic (M) and silver (S) males differ in social behavior and in how conspecifics respond to them, suggesting the potential for IGEs. We used a combination of live and video recording of social groups in two natural populations and in the laboratory to determine the potential for IGEs to contribute to behavioral variation in this species. We found that M males had more social partners, and especially more female social partners than did S males, in nature and in the laboratory. These results suggest that both direct and indirect genetic effects have the potential to play a role in the expression and evolution of social behavior in G. holbrooki. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH},

abstract={Males of socially monogamous species can increase their siring success via within-pair and extra-pair fertilizations. In this study, we focused on the different sources of (co)variation between these siring routes, and asked how each contributes to total siring success. We quantified the fertilization routes to siring success, as well as behaviors that have been hypothesized to affect siring success, over a five-year period for a wild population of great tits Parus major. We considered siring success and its fertilization routes as “interactive phenotypes” arising from phenotypic contributions of both members of the social pair. We show that siring success is strongly affected by the fecundity of the social (female) partner. We also demonstrate that a strong positive correlation between extra-pair fertilization success and paternity loss likely constrains the evolution of these two routes. Moreover, we show that more explorative and aggressive males had less extra-pair fertilizations, whereas more explorative females laid larger clutches. This study thus demonstrates that (co)variation in siring routes is caused by multiple factors not necessarily related to characteristics of males. We thereby highlight the importance of acknowledging the multilevel structure of male fertilization routes when studying the evolution of male mating strategies. © 2016 The Author(s).

abstract={Background: Mortality due to cannibalism causes both economic and welfare problems in laying hens. To limit mortality due to cannibalism, laying hens are often beak-trimmed, which is undesirable for animal welfare reasons. Genetic selection is an alternative strategy to increase survival and is more efficient by taking heritable variation that originates from social interactions into account, which are modelled as the so-called indirect genetic effects (IGE). Despite the considerable heritable variation in survival time due to IGE, genetic improvement of survival time in laying hens is still challenging because the detected heritable variation of the trait with IGE is still limited, ranging from 0.06 to 0.26, and individuals that are still alive at the end of the recording period are censored. Furthermore, survival time records are available late in life and only on females. To cope with these challenges, we tested the hypothesis that genomic prediction increases the accuracy of estimated breeding values (EBV) compared to parental average EBV, and increases response to selection for survival time compared to a traditional breeding scheme. We tested this hypothesis in two lines of brown layers with intact beaks, which show cannibalism, and also the hypothesis that the rate of inbreeding per year is lower for genomic selection than for the traditional breeding scheme. Results and discussion: The standard deviation of genomic prediction EBV for survival time was around 22 days for both lines, indicating good prospects for selection against mortality in laying hens with intact beaks. Genomic prediction increased the accuracy of the EBV by 35 and 32 % compared to the parent average EBV for the two lines. At the current reference population size, predicted response to selection was 91 % higher when using genomic selection than with the traditional breeding scheme, as a result of a shorter generation interval in males and greater accuracy of selection in females. The predicted rate of inbreeding per generation with truncation selection was substantially lower for genomic selection than for the traditional breeding scheme for both lines. Conclusions: Genomic selection for socially affected traits is a promising tool for the improvement of survival time in laying hens with intact beaks. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Social interactions among animals are widely existed in livestock population. However, some studies showed that the selection of social genetic effect leaded to extra increase of inbreeding. In this study, two optimization methods (SBLUP+GA1, SBLUP+GA2) based on genetic algorithm were used to obtain the optimal genetic contributions of seedstocks and maximize the average genetic gains of direct and social genetic component while minimizing the inbreeding. In SBLUP+GA1, only the contributions of sires were optimized. In SBLUP+GA2, the contributions of sires and dams were optimized together. The results showed SBLUP+GA1 and SBLUP+GA2 resulted in 18.52% and 25.93% lower inbreeding rate than common social genetic effect selection based on BLUP method (SBLUP) under base parameters, respectively. Under that situation, the average gains for direct, social and total genetic effect component in SBLUP+GA1 were actually improved 3.59%, 10.02% and 4.32% relative to SBLUP, respectively. In SBLUP+GA2, they were 1.28%, 10.00% and 2.02%, respectively. SBLUP+GA2 resulted in lower inbreeding rate, but, obtained slightly less genetic gain than SBLUP+GA1. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Kin selection theory has always been explicitly genetic and has long been invoked to explain the evolution of the sterile worker caste in the social insects. However, sociogenomic studies of the evolution and genomic basis of social insect caste have been largely disconnected from kin selection theory and other related genetic theories of social evolution. Two previous population genetic models make testable predictions for patterns of sequence diversity for genes shaped indirectly by kin selection compared to genes shaped directly by natural selection, but there is some confusion in the literature regarding the predicted effects of kin selection and sex-limited expression on molecular evolution. We review the previous models and then use a simple parental effect model to clarify that the two factors, kin selection and sex-limited expression, are distinct and each has a separate effect on the expected patterns of molecular evolution. We further build on the previous models to show how categories of genes in social insect genomes with diverse combinations of fitness effects (direct, parental, sib, and offspring) and patterns of sex-limitation are predicted to evolve. We discuss how caste- and sex-specific transcriptomic profiling, coupled with population genomic data, can be used to identify different functional categories of genes and subsequently test whether observed patterns of molecular evolution fit theoretical predictions. © 2016 Linksvayer and Wade.},

abstract={Aggregation behaviour is the tendency for animals to group together, which may have important consequences on individual fitness. We used a combination of experimental and simulation approaches to study how genetic variation and social environment interact to influence aggregation dynamics in Drosophila. To do this, we used two different natural lines of Drosophila that arise from a polymorphism in the foraging gene (rovers and sitters). We placed groups of flies in a heated arena. Flies could freely move towards one of two small, cooler refuge areas. In groups of the same strain, sitters had a greater tendency to aggregate. The observed behavioural variation was based on only two parameters: the probability of entering a refuge and the likelihood of choosing a refuge based on the number of individuals present. We then directly addressed how different strains interact by mixing rovers and sitters within a group. Aggregation behaviour of each line was strongly affected by the presence of the other strain, without changing the decision rules used by each. Individuals obeying local rules shaped complex group dynamics via a constant feedback loop between the individual and the group. This study could help to identify the circumstances under which particular group compositions may improve individual fitness through underlying aggregation mechanisms under specific environmental conditions. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Mitochondria are involved in ageing and their function requires coordinated action of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Epistasis between the two genomes can influence lifespan but whether this also holds for reproductive senescence is unclear. Maternal inheritance of mitochondria predicts sex differences in the efficacy of selection on mitonuclear genotypes that should result in differences between females and males in mitochondrial genetic effects. Mitonuclear genotype of a focal individual may also indirectly affect trait expression in the mating partner. We tested these predictions in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus, using introgression lines harbouring distinct mitonuclear genotypes. Our results reveal both direct and indirect sex-specific effects of mitonuclear epistasis on reproductive ageing. Females harbouring coadapted mitonuclear genotypes showed higher lifetime fecundity due to slower senescence relative to novel mitonuclear combinations. We found no evidence for mitonuclear coadaptation in males. Mitonuclear epistasis not only affected age-specific ejaculate weight, but also influenced male age-dependent indirect effects on traits expressed by their female partners (fecundity, egg size, longevity). These results demonstrate important consequences of sex-specific mitonuclear epistasis for both mating partners, consistent with a role for mitonuclear genetic constraints upon sex-specific adaptive evolution. © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={Theory predicts that intraspecific genetic variation can increase the complexity of an ecological network. To date, however, we are lacking empirical knowledge of the extent to which genetic variation determines the assembly of ecological networks, as well as how the gain or loss of genetic variation will affect network structure. To address this knowledge gap, we used a common garden experiment to quantify the extent to which heritable trait variation in a host plant determines the assembly of its associated insect food web (network of trophic interactions). We then used a resampling procedure to simulate the additive effects of genetic variation on overall food-web complexity. We found that trait variation among host-plant genotypes was associated with resistance to insect herbivores, which indirectly affected interactions between herbivores and their insect parasitoids. Direct and indirect genetic effects resulted in distinct compositions of trophic interactions associated with each host-plant genotype. Moreover, our simulations suggest that food-web complexity would increase by 20% over the range of genetic variation in the experimental population of host plants. Taken together, our results indicate that intraspecific genetic variation can play a key role in structuring ecological networks, which may in turn affect network persistence.},

abstract={Phosphorus utilization (PU) has received considerable attention in poultry nutrition. However, reliable estimates of genetic parameters for PU and related traits have largely not been reported until now; however, these are needed to assess whether selection for an improved PU would result in selection response. A large Japanese quail F2 cross was generated and 888 F2 individuals were phenotyped for PU, bodyweight gain (BWG), and feed per gain (F:G). Because it can reasonably be assumed that the interrelationships between these traits are complex, structural equation models were used. The structural coefficient λij describes the rate of change of trait i with respect to trait j for a model with a recursive effect of trait j on trait i. Three recursive structural coefficients (λF:G,PU, λBWG,PU, λBWG,F:G) were selected a priori based on biological knowledge. The model was fitted using ASReml software. Standard errors of estimated variance components and genetic parameters were approximated using the delta method. The heritability of PU, F:G, and BWG were 0.136, 0.118, and 0.092. The structural coefficient λF:G,PU =-0.177 indicates that an increase in PU leads to reduced and thus improved F:G. The estimate λBWG,F:G =-0.963 indicates that improved F:G leads to an increase in BWG. The overall effect of PU on BWG was λBWG,PU + λF:G,PU × λBWG,F:G = 0.374, i.e. an increase in PU of 1% leads to an increase of BWG of 0.374 g in the data collection period, which spanned five days. The phenotypic and genetic correlations were negative between PU and F:G as well as between BWG and F:G and were positive between PU and BWG. These correlations are driven by direct genetic effects (pleiotropic genes or genes being in linkage disequilibrium) as well as by indirect genetic effects (genes affecting trait j affected indirectly trait i). The application of structural equation models contributed to our understanding of the complex biological relationship between PU, F:G, and BWG in quails. PU shows a heritability that is sufficient to achieve a selection response when breeding for this very-hard-to-measure trait. © 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.},

abstract={Summary: Social interactions among individuals are abundant, both in wild and in domestic populations. With social interactions, the genes of an individual may affect the trait values of other individuals, a phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects (IGEs). IGEs can be estimated using linear mixed models. Most IGE models assume that individuals interact equally to all group mates irrespective of relatedness. Kin selection theory, however, predicts that an individual will interact differently with family members versus non-family members. Here, we investigate kin- and sex-specific non-genetic social interactions in group-housed mink. Furthermore, we investigated whether systematic non-genetic interactions between kin or individuals of the same sex influence the estimates of genetic parameters. As a second objective, we clarify the relationship between estimates of the traditional IGE model and a family-based IGE model proposed in a previous study. Our results indicate that male siblings in mink show different non-genetic interactions than female siblings in mink and that this may impact the estimation of genetic parameters. Moreover, we have shown how estimates from a family-based IGE model can be translated to the ordinary direct-indirect model and vice versa. We find no evidence for genetic differences in interactions among related versus unrelated mink. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

abstract={Caste determination in social insects has long been considered to exemplify socially mediated phenotypic plasticity: young larvae can develop into queens or workers depending on the social environment. However, recent studies have challenged this view by showing that, in some species, larval development can be biased early by factors such as larval genotype. We analyzed this issue in the ant species Aphaenogaster senilis. First, we found that the probability that a larva develops into a queen or a worker varies consistently among colonies. Next, we conducted a cross-fostering experiment in which larvae from colonies with relatively low queen production were transferred to colonies with relatively high queen production and vice versa. The results show a strong significant interaction between early determination and worker control of larval caste fate. Therefore, our study shows that socially mediated phenotypic plasticity is limited by processes occurring at an early developmental stage that possibly include direct or indirect genetic effects or non-genetic maternal effects. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In many taxa there is considerable intraspecific variation in life history strategies from within a single population, reflecting alternative routes through which organisms can achieve successful reproduction. Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (Linnaeus) show some of the greatest within-population variability in life history strategies amongst vertebrates, with multiple discrete male and female life histories co-existing and interbreeding on many spawning grounds, although the effect of the various combinations of life histories on offspring traits remains unknown. Using crosses of wild fish we show here that the life history strategy of both parents was significantly associated with a range of offspring traits. Mothers that had spent longer at sea (2 versus 1 year) produced offspring that were heavier, longer and in better condition at the time of first feeding. However, these relationships disappeared shortly after fry had begun feeding exogenously. At this stage, the juvenile rearing environment (i.e. time spent in fresh water as juveniles) of the mother was a better predictor of offspring traits, with mothers that were faster to develop in fresh water (migrating to sea after two rather than three years of age) producing offspring that had higher maximal metabolic rates, aerobic scopes, and that grew faster. Faster developing fathers (1 year old sneaker males) tended to produce offspring that had higher maximal metabolic rates, were in better body condition and grew faster. The results suggest that both genetic effects and those related to parental early and late life history contribute to offspring traits. © 2016. Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.},

abstract={Parental care, a central component of reproduction in a wide range of animal species, often involves elaborate behavioural interactions between parents and their offspring. Due to the reciprocal nature of these interactions, it has been hypothesized that parental and offspring behaviours (e.g. parental food provisioning and offspring begging) are not only target but also agent of selection. These traits are therefore expected to co-evolve, ultimately leading to co-adaptation of parent and offspring behaviours within families. However, empirical data on such parent-offspring co-adaptation are limited, particularly for wild populations. Furthermore, mean levels of behaviour (as measured in previous studies) may not adequately describe the dynamic nature of the reciprocal interplay between parents and their offspring, and instead rather the behavioural reaction norms for provisioning and begging may be co-adapted. We applied a large-scale cross-fostering study over 3 consecutive breeding seasons to investigate whether provisioning behaviour of wild blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) parents covaries with the begging behaviour of their genetic, cross-fostered offspring. We simultaneously analysed parent and offspring behaviours, both as static traits (mean levels) and behavioural reaction norms (offspring begging as a function of food deprivation and parental provisioning as a function of short-term experimental changes in brood size). Neither maternal nor paternal provisioning rates covaried with the begging intensity of their genetic offspring when analysed as mean levels of behaviour. However, the slopes of the reaction norms for provisioning and begging were negatively correlated between male, but not female, parents and their genetic offspring. Thus, fathers that change their provisioning rate strongly with brood size sire offspring whose level of begging only weakly increases with hunger, and vice versa. The observed covariation suggests the existence of sex-specific optima for parent-offspring trait combinations. Thus, our study not only highlights the importance of a behavioural reaction norm approach when investigating parent-offspring interactions, but also stresses the relevance of considering parents as separate units, at least for biparental species. © 2016 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Social interactions among individuals may affect individual productivity and welfare in aquaculture. Since social effects may have a genetic component, known as an indirect genetic effect (IGE), genetic selection may be a promising tool to simultaneously improve welfare and productivity in aquaculture. Here we compare two experimental designs that have been previously proposed for the genetic improvement of socially affected traits. We used stochastic simulations to compare a design where each group consisted of members of two families (2-FAM) with a design where each group consisted of members of three families (3-FAM). The 2-FAM and 3-FAM designs were compared using an equal number of groups (96 groups). The group size, i.e., number of individuals within each group, was either 30 or 60 individuals. Both designs were compared for the precision of estimated direct and social genetic parameters and for response to selection, either with or without a restriction on the rate of inbreeding. Four different schemes with a low variance (heritability for social effects or hS2=0.1), a moderate variance (hS2=0.3), or a high variance (hS2=0.5) of the social genetic effects, and a negative correlation between direct and social genetic effects (rAD,S=-0.6) were compared. The negative rAD,S indicates competition between group mates. Differences in precision of estimated genetic parameters between both designs were small. At low hS2 and group size of 30, the 2-FAM design was superior with respect to precision of social additive genetic variance. When the social genetic variance was small, a larger group size, e.g. 60 is recommended. The 2-FAM design resulted in a higher accuracy of selection for social and total genetic effects, but also in a higher rate of inbreeding compared to the 3-FAM design. When the rate of inbreeding was restricted to ~2%, the total response to selection was significantly higher for the 3-FAM design. In conclusion, the 2-FAM and 3-FAM designs differ little in accuracy of the direct and social genetic parameter estimates, while the 3-FAM design is superior with respect to the response to selection at a fixed rate of inbreeding. This study is particularly important for making decisions regarding experimental design when breeding for social genetic effects in aquaculture. Statement of relevance: Communal or family rearing with a large number of animals in a group is common practice in aquaculture. Large variation in body size, which may inflate competition for feed, is generally observed in the communal rearing tank. In addition, cannibalistic or aggressive behaviour is frequently observed in a large variety of fish species. So far, the issue is addressed by management measures, such as size grading, which may be labour intensive. Sustainable solutions through selective breeding have not been tested.Previous studies compared two experimental designs for social interaction traits; groups composed of two families (2-FAM) and three families (3-FAM) with groups composed at random and found that the 2-FAM and 3-FAM designs were better with respect to genetic parameter estimates than designs with groups composed at random. It is however still unknown whether the 2-FAM or the 3-FAM design is better. Previous studies did not consider the rate of inbreeding when studying the designs. This paper describes the results from a comparison of the two experimental designs for estimating genetic parameters and obtaining response to selection, taking into account the rate of inbreeding. As such, this paper should be of interest to a broad readership including those interested in aquaculture genetics. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Increased maternal age at reproduction is often associated with decreased offspring performance in numerous species of plants and animals (including humans). Current evolutionary theory considers such maternal effect senescence as part of a unified process of reproductive senescence, which is under identical age-specific selective pressures to fertility. We offer a novel theoretical perspective by combining William Hamilton's evolutionary model for aging with a quantitative genetic model of indirect genetic effects. We demonstrate that fertility and maternal effect senescence are likely to experience different patterns of age-specific selection and thus can evolve to take divergent forms. Applied to neonatal survival, we find that selection for maternal effects is the product of age-specific fertility and Hamilton's age-specific force of selection for fertility. Population genetic models show that senescence for these maternal effects can evolve in the absence of reproductive or actuarial senescence; this implies that maternal effect aging is a fundamentally distinct demographic manifestation of the evolution of aging. However, brief periods of increasingly beneficial maternal effects can evolve when fertility increases with age faster than cumulative survival declines. This is most likely to occur early in life. Our integration of theory provides a general framework with which to model, measure, and compare the evolutionary determinants of the social manifestations of aging. Extension of our maternal effects model to other ecological and social contexts could provide important insights into the drivers of the astonishing diversity of lifespans and aging patterns observed among species.},

abstract={Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are the basis of social interactions among conspecifics, and can affect genetic variation of nonsocial and social traits. We used flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) of two phenotypically distinguishable populations to estimate genetic (co)variances and the effect of IGEs on three life-history traits: development time (DT), growth rate (GR), and pupal body mass (BM). We found that GR was strongly affected by social environment with IGEs accounting for 18% of the heritable variation. We also discovered a sex-specific social effect: male ratio in a group significantly affected both GR and BM; that is, beetles grew larger and faster in male-biased social environments. Such sex-specific IGEs have not previously been demonstrated in a nonsocial insect. Our results show that beetles that achieve a higher BM do so via a slower GR in response to social environment. Existing models of evolution in age-structured or stage-structured populations do not account for IGEs of social cohorts. It is likely that such IGEs have played a key role in the evolution of developmental plasticity shown by Tenebrionid larvae in response to density. Our results document an important source of genetic variation for GR, often overlooked in life-history theory. © 2016, Society for the Study of Evolution.},

abstract={Trait values of individuals are affected not only by their genetic makeup, but also by environmental factors and interactions with other individuals. The heritable effect of an individual on the trait values of other individuals it interacts with is known as an indirect genetic effect (IGE). Such IGEs may affect response to selection. Fish selected for high growth rate, for example, have been shown to be more aggressive and competitive, which may reduce the observed response in growth rate. The main objective of this study is to quantify the genetic and non-genetic indirect effects for harvest weight in the GIFT strain of Nile tilapia. A total of 6330 fish with harvest weight information were used to estimate genetic and non-genetic parameters. A bivariate analysis of harvest weight and survival was conducted by fitting different mixed models to investigate the presence of IGEs and other non-genetic effects. The full set of genetic parameters could not be estimated simultaneously with the inclusion of maternal common environmental effects. A confounding between maternal common environmental effects and direct genetic effects resulted from the mating strategy, where one sire was mated to only one or two dams. A 1 male to 2 females mating design is common in aquaculture, but it has limited power to estimate genetic parameters. Models without maternal common environmental effects showed significant IGE on harvest weight, which contributed 48% of total heritable variance. Models with maternal common environmental effects suggested the presence of IGE. The direct-indirect genetic correlation for harvest weight was negative (-. 0.38. ±. 0.19), indicating that traditional selection, if performed in an environment where the fish have to compete with each other for the resources, will increase competition. A strongly negative genetic correlation between direct effects on survival and indirect effects on harvest weight (-. 0.79. ±. 0.30) showed that individuals with better genes for survival suppressed growth rate of their social partners. Our results suggest that heritable competitive interactions affect harvest weight in Nile tilapia. Hence, breeding schemes may need to be adapted to avoid an increase in aggressiveness due to selection for growth rate in a competitive environment. Further studies are required to investigate the relevance of IGE and its implications on different systems of commercial aquaculture production. Statement of relevance: Sociable fish will help to improve aquaculture production. © 2015.},

abstract={Understanding how genetic diversity, infections and fitness interact in wild populations is a major challenge in ecology and management. These interactions were addressed through heterozygosity-fitness correlation analyses, by assessing the genetic diversity, tuberculosis (TB) and body size in adult red deer. Heterozygosity-fitness correlation models provided a better understanding of the link between genetic diversity and TB at individual and population levels. A single local effect was found for Ceh45 locus at individual level, enhancing the importance of its close functional genes in determining TB presence. At population level, the ability of the red deer to control TB progression correlated positively with population genetic diversity, indicating that inbred populations might represent more risk of deer TB severity. Statistical models also gained insights into the dynamics of multi-host interaction in natural environments. TB prevalence in neighbouring wild boar populations was positively associated with deer TB at both individual and population levels. Additionally, TB presence correlated positively with red deer body size, for which “general and local effect” hypotheses were found. Although body size might be correlated with age, an indirect genetic effect on TB presence could be implied. This study provides new insights towards understanding host-pathogen interactions in wild populations and their relation to fitness traits. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Debates about how coevolution of sexual traits and preferences might promote evolutionary diversification have permeated speciation research for over a century. Recent work demonstrates that the expression of such traits can be sensitive to variation in the social environment. Here, we examined social flexibility in a sexually selected male trait-cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles-in the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus and tested whether population genetic divergence predicts the extent or direction of social flexibility in allopatric populations. We manipulated male crickets' social environments during rearing and then characterized CHC profiles. CHC signatures varied considerably across populations and also in response to the social environment, but our prediction that increased social flexibility would be selected in more recently founded populations exposed to fluctuating demographic environments was unsupported. Furthermore, models examining the influence of drift and selection failed to support a role of sexual selection in driving population divergence in CHC profiles. Variation in social environments might alter the dynamics of sexual selection, but our results align with theoretical predictions that the role social flexibility plays in modulating evolutionary divergence depends critically on whether responses to variation in the social environment are homogeneous across populations, or whether gene by social environment interactions occur. © 2016, Society for the Study of Evolution.},

abstract={Background: Our aim was to estimate the genetic parameters for the direct genetic effect (DGE) and indirect genetic effects (IGE) on adult body weight in the Pacific white shrimp. IGE is the heritable effect of an individual on the trait values of its group mates. Methods: To examine IGE on body weight, 4725 shrimp from 105 tagged families were tested in multiple small test groups (MSTG). Each family was separated into three groups (15 shrimp per group) that were randomly assigned to 105 concrete tanks with shrimp from two other families. To estimate breeding values, one large test group (OLTG) in a 300 m2 circular concrete tank was used for the communal rearing of 8398 individuals from 105 families. Body weight was measured after a growth-test period of more than 200 days. Variance components for body weight in the MSTG programs were estimated using an animal model excluding or including IGE whereas variance components in the OLTG programs were estimated using a conventional animal model that included only DGE. The correlation of DGE between MSTG and OLTG programs was estimated by a two-trait animal model that included or excluded IGE. Results: Heritability estimates for body weight from the conventional animal model in MSTG and OLTG programs were 0.26 ± 0.13 and 0.40 ± 0.06, respectively. The log likelihood ratio test revealed significant IGE on body weight. Total heritable variance was the sum of direct genetic variance (43.5 %), direct-indirect genetic covariance (2.1 %), and indirect genetic variance (54.4 %). It represented 73 % of the phenotypic variance and was more than two-fold greater than that (32 %) obtained by using a classical heritability model for body weight. Correlations of DGE on body weight between MSTG and OLTG programs were intermediate regardless of whether IGE were included or not in the model. Conclusions: Our results suggest that social interactions contributed to a large part of the heritable variation in body weight. Small and non-significant direct-indirect genetic correlations implied that neutral or slightly cooperative heritable interactions, rather than competition, were dominant in this population but this may be due to the low rearing density. © 2015 Luan et al.},

abstract={There is increasing recognition that genetic diversity can affect the spread of diseases, potentially affecting plant and livestock disease control as well as the emergence of human disease outbreaks. Nevertheless, even though computational tools can guide the control of infectious diseases, few epidemiological models can simultaneously accommodate the inherent individual heterogeneity in multiple infectious disease traits influencing disease transmission, such as the frequently modeled propensity to become infected and infectivity, which describes the host ability to transmit the infection to susceptible individuals. Furthermore, current quantitative genetic models fail to fully capture the heritable variation in host infectivity, mainly because they cannot accommodate the nonlinear infection dynamics underlying epidemiological data. We present in this article a novel statistical model and an inference method to estimate genetic parameters associated with both host susceptibility and infectivity. Our methodology combines quantitative genetic models of social interactions with stochastic processes to model the random, nonlinear, and dynamic nature of infections and uses adaptive Bayesian computational techniques to estimate the model parameters. Results using simulated epidemic data show that our model can accurately estimate heritabilities and genetic risks not only of susceptibility but also of infectivity, therefore exploring a trait whose heritable variation is currently ignored in disease genetics and can greatly influence the spread of infectious diseases. Our proposed methodology offers potential impacts in areas such as livestock disease control through selective breeding and also in predicting and controlling the emergence of disease outbreaks in human populations. © 2015 by the Genetics Society of America.},

abstract={Recent developments in the study of mating behaviour have emphasized the importance of strategic investment of limited reproductive resources. However, in many cases it can be difficult to interpret traits such as copula duration, because they are interacting phenotypes that ultimately depend upon both the male and female mating partner, and the sexes may frequently disagree over the optimal outcome. Here we report the results of experiments designed to establish which sex controls copula duration in the birch catkin bug, Kleidocerys resedae, and to test for strategic investment by the controlling sex. First, we found that matings of field-caught individuals were relatively short, but that copula duration increased following a period of sexual isolation, reaching a maximum after 2 days. However, copula duration was again shorter in re-pairings of the same individuals 1. h after their first mating. Because these results could be interpreted as a response to sexual isolation by either sex, we next investigated whether copula duration is under male or female control in this species. Experimental pairings between males and females isolated for 1. h or 48. h in all four possible combinations revealed that copula duration depended strongly on the period of male but not of female sexual isolation, implying that this trait is under male control. Finally, if males mated once were re-paired after 1. h with either the same or a novel (but still recently mated) female, we found that they mated for significantly longer with the latter. Collectively, our results imply that male birch catkin bugs in nature are frequently time-, sperm- or seminal fluid-limited, and that, as predicted by theory, they strategically allocate more of their mating effort and ejaculate reserves to novel females, a form of (cryptic) male mate choice. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={There is increasing interest in understanding the processes that maintain phenotypic variation in groups, populations, or communities. Recent studies have investigated how the phenotypic composition of groups or aggregations (e.g., its average phenotype or phenotypic variance) affects ecological and social processes, and how multi-level selection can drive phenotypic covariance among interacting individuals. However, we argue that these questions are rarely studied together. We present a unified framework to address this gap, and discuss how group phenotypic composition (GPC) can impact on processes ranging from individual fitness to population demography. By emphasising the breadth of topics affected, we hope to motivate more integrated empirical studies of the ecological and evolutionary implications of GPC. Members of animal groups often vary in their phenotypes (e.g., personality, morphology). Many recent studies have shown how different aspects (e.g., phenotypic average, variation, extreme) of GPC affect group-level outcomes (e.g., foraging success, mating system). Group-level outcomes can shape selection when individual and group phenotypes co-vary. Selection arising from GPC can drive changes in traits that affect aspects of individual-to-group covariance, such as behaviours that determine group membership or by changing the expression of traits (via phenotypic plasticity or indirect genetic effects). A framework based on interacting phenotype theory can quantify the selective consequences and evaluate the evolutionary implications of GPC. This framework is still largely unexplored empirically but it is applicable to many topics in evolutionary biology. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={While competition is recognized as a major factor responsible for plant community dynamics, the genetics of intra- and interspecific competitive ability of a target species (i.e. level of intra-population genetic variation, identity of phenotypic traits under selection and genetic bases) still deserves a deeper investigation at the local spatial scale by considering both numerous genotypes and several interacting species. In this study, we tested whether the genetics of competitive response and effect in Arabidopsis thaliana was dependent on the competitive environment at both the intraspecific and interspecific levels. We used a mapping population of 48 accessions (i) that maximize the genetic diversity of a local population of A. thaliana and (ii) that have been genotyped for 168 503 single nucleotide polymorphisms. In a common garden experiment, those 48 accessions were grown in six competitive environments: the absence of competition, intraspecific competition and interspecific competition with four species frequently associated with A. thaliana in natural plant communities (i.e. Poa annua, Stellaria media, Trifolium repens and Veronica arvensis). A suite of nine phenotypic traits, including a proxy of fitness, were scored on each target A. thaliana plant and the above-ground dry biomass of its corresponding competitor was estimated. We first showed that crossing reaction norms of competitive response (A. thaliana performance) and effect (competitor biomass) might promote maintenance of genetic variation in a local population of A. thaliana and species coexistence at a fine spatial scale. By estimating genotypic gradients of selection, we then demonstrated that the optimal phenotypic strategies in response to competition depend on the identity of the competitor species. Finally, a genomewide association mapping approach highlighted that genomic regions associated with direct genetic effects were (i) dependent on the competitor species and (ii) different from genomic regions associated with interspecific indirect genetic effects. While a first step, this study highlighted the power of adding ecology to genomics in A. thaliana to identify genetic bases underlying micro-geographic adaptation to competition. Next-generation sequencing technologies will undoubtedly facilitate the discovery of molecular and genetic mechanisms underlying competitive ability in other plant species, and thereby the prediction of evolutionary trajectories of plant communities. © 2015 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Background: Minimizing bird losses is important in the commercial layer industry. Selection against mortality is challenging because heritability is low, censoring is high, and individual survival depends on social interactions among cage members. With cannibalism, mortality depends not only on an individual's own genes (direct genetic effects; DGE) but also on genes of its cage mates (indirect genetic effects; IGE). To date, studies using DGE-IGE models have focussed on survival time but their shortcomings are that censored records were considered as exact lengths of life and models assumed that IGE were continuously expressed by all cage members even after death. However, since dead animals no longer express IGE, IGE should ideally be time-dependent in the model. Neglecting censoring and timing of IGE expression may reduce accuracy of estimated breeding values (EBV). Thus, our aim was to improve prediction of breeding values for survival time in layers that present cannibalism. Methods: We considered four DGE-IGE models to predict survival time in layers. One model was an analysis of survival time and the three others treated survival in consecutive months as a repeated binomial trait (repeated measures models). We also tested whether EBV were improved by including timing of IGE expression in the analyses. Approximate EBV accuracies were calculated by cross-validation. The models were fitted to survival data on two purebred White Leghorn layer lines W1 and WB, each having monthly survival records over 13 months. Results: Including the timing of IGE expression in the DGE-IGE model reduced EBV accuracy compared to analysing survival time. EBV accuracy was higher when repeated measures models were used. However, there was no universal best model. Using repeated measures instead of analysing survival time increased EBV accuracy by 10 to 21 and 2 to 12 % for W1 and WB, respectively. We showed how EBV and variance components estimated with repeated measures models can be translated into survival time. Conclusions: Our results suggest that prediction of breeding values for survival time in laying hens can be improved using repeated measures models. This is an important result since more accurate EBV contribute to higher rates of genetic gain. © 2015 Brinker et al.},

abstract={Group housing of gestating sows has implications for reproductive performance due to detrimental interactions between sows within groups. Reproductive records (n = 10,748) were obtained for 8,444 pedigreed nucleus sows housed in a single facility, formed into 1,827 static groups during gestation. Only data from complete groups were used to estimate genetic parameters for total born (TB), number born alive (NBA), and gestation length (GL) and to compare models extended to account for group effects. Censored data for sows which did not farrow (0.8% of records) were augmented with biologically meaningful values. Group sizes ranged from 2 to 10, in pens designed to hold 4, 8, or 10 sows per pen. Sows were grouped by parity, line, and mating date after d 35 of pregnancy. Heritability estimates were generally constant across all model alternatives at 0.11 ± 0.02 for TB and NBA and 0.32 ± 0.03 for GL. However, models for all traits were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) improved through inclusion of terms for nongenetic group and social genetic effects (SGE). Group effects were no longer significant in models containing both terms. The proportional contributions of SGE (s 2 ) to phenotypic variances were very low (≤0.002 across traits), but their contributions to calculated total genetic variance (T 2 ) were significant. The differences between h 2 and T 2 ranged between 3 and 5% under simple models, increasing to 8 to 14% in models accounting for both covariances between additive direct (A) and SGE and the effects of varying group size on the magnitude of estimates for SGE. Estimates of covariance between A and SGE were sensitive to the modeling of dilution factors for group size. The models of best fit for litter size traits used a customized dilution based on sows/pen relative to the maximum sows/ pen. The best model supported a reduction in SGE with increased space per sow, independent of maximum group size, and no significant correlation between A and SGE. The latter is expected if A and SGE reflect different trait complexes. It is suggested that the SGE estimated for reproductive traits represented the expression of an unobserved phenotype, such as sow aggression, of an individual on its pen mates. Further investigation into the use of competitive effects models for genetic evaluation of reproductive traits for grouphoused sows could be considered a strategy to improve welfare and performance of group-housed sows. © 2015 American Society of Animal Science.

abstract={Background: Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one individual alter the expression of traits in social partners. Previous studies focused on the evolutionary consequences and evolutionary dynamics of IGEs, using equilibrium solutions to predict phenotypes in subsequent generations. However, whether or not such steady states may be reached may depend on the dynamics of interactions themselves. Results: In our study, we focus on the dynamics of social interactions and indirect genetic effects and investigate how they modify phenotypes over time. Unlike previous IGE studies, we do not analyse evolutionary dynamics; rather we consider within-individual phenotypic changes, also referred to as phenotypic plasticity. We analyse iterative interactions, when individuals interact in a series of discontinuous events, and investigate the stability of steady state solutions and the dependence on model parameters, such as population size, strength, and the nature of interactions. We show that for interactions where a feedback loop occurs, the possible parameter space of interaction strength is fairly limited, affecting the evolutionary consequences of IGEs. We discuss the implications of our results for current IGE model predictions and their limitations. © 2015 Trubenová et al.

abstract={The consequences of sexual interactions extend beyond the simple production of offspring. These interactions typically entail direct effects on female fitness, but may also impact the life histories of later generations. Evaluating the cross-generational effects of sexual interactions provides insights into the dynamics of sexual selection and conflict. Such studies can elucidate whether offspring fitness optima diverge across sexes upon heightened levels of sexual interaction among parents.Here,we found that, inDrosophilamelanogaster, components of reproductive success in females, but not males, were contingent on the nature of sexual interactions experienced by their mothers. In particular, maternal sexual interactions with non-sires enhanced female fecundity in the following generation. This highlights the importance of non-sire influences of sexual interactions on the expression of offspring life histories. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Males can through their behavior (e.g., courtship feeding) exert an indirect effect on their partner’s reproductive traits, such as the seasonal timing and size of her clutch. Evidence for such indirect (male) effect on reproduction is starting to accumulate. We quantify female and male effects on reproduction in the tawny owl Strix aluco using a hierarchical mixed model on data collected in 1978–2013. We find that differences between males explain 7 % of the phenotypic variance in laying date (females 5 %). In contrast, females have a clear (11 %) effect on clutch size, whereas males have no effect. Based on multivariate hierarchical modeling, we find an individual-level correlation between the male-specific effect on laying date and his body mass (but not his plumage color or wing length). Heavy males may be able to affect their partner’s seasonal timing of laying because of an advantage in providing courtship feeding prior to reproduction. Our findings illustrate that males can be an important determinant of variation in reproduction and that multivariate mixed models present a general approach to pinpoint which individual characteristics could be associated with such indirect effects. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The aims of this study were to estimate covariance components for BW at 270 d (BW270) and carcass and ham quality traits in heavy pigs using models accounting for social effects and to compare the ability of such models to fit the data relative to models ignoring social interactions. Phenotypic records were from 9,871 pigs sired by 293 purebred boars mated to 456 crossbred sows. Piglets were born and reared at the same farm and randomly assigned at 60 d of age to groups (6.1 pigs per group on average) housed in finishing pens, each having an area of 6 m2. The average additive genetic relationship among group mates was 0.11. Pigs were slaughtered at 277 ± 3 d of age and 169.7 ± 13.9 kg BW in groups of nearly 70 animals each. Four univariate animal models were compared: a basic model (M1) including only direct additive genetic effects, a model (M2) with nonheritable social group (pen) effects in addition to effects in M1, a model (M3) accounting for litter effects in addition to M2, and a model (M4) accounting for social genetic effects in addition to effects in M3. Restricted maximum likelihood estimates of covariance components were obtained for BW270; carcass backfat depth; carcass lean meat content (CLM); iodine number (IOD); and linoleic acid content (LIA) of raw ham subcutaneous fat; subcutaneous fat depth in the proximity of semimembranosus muscle (SFD1) and quadriceps femoris muscle (SFD2); and linear scores for ham round shape (RS), subcutaneous fat (SF), and marbling. Likelihood ratio tests indicated that, for all traits, M2 fit the data better than M1 and that M3 was superior to M2 except for SFD1 and SFD2. Model M4 was significantly better than M3 for BW270 (P &lt; 0.001) and CLM, IOD, RS, and SF (P &lt; 0.05). The contribution of social genetic effects to the total heritable variance was large for CLM and BW270, ranging from 33.2 to 35%, whereas the one for ham quality traits ranged from 6.8 (RS) to 11.2% (SF). Direct and social genetic effects on BW270 were uncorrelated, whereas there was a negative genetic covariance between direct and social effects on CLM, IOD, RS, and SF, which reduced the total heritable variance. This variance, measured relative to phenotypic variance, ranged from 21 (CLM) to 54% (BW270). Results indicate that social genetic effects affect variation in traits relevant for heavy pigs used in dry-cured hams manufacturing. Such effects should be exploited and taken into account in design of breeding programs for heavy pigs. © 2015 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The social complexity that characterizes the eusocial insects strongly affects all aspects of social insect life, including the molecular and evolutionary genetic basis of social insect traits. Quantitative genetic theory and empirical approaches have been developed over the past 60 years specifically to study the genetic implications of social interactions. Surprisingly, given the obvious biological importance of social interactions in social insects, this research tradition has been and continues to be widely overlooked throughout the social insect literature, including in recent sociogenomic studies focused on understanding the molecular underpinnings of social life. Instead, the overwhelming majority of social insect genetic research has relied on conventional genetic approaches developed for solitary organisms focused on the one-to-one association of an individual's genes to its own traits. I survey social insect studies that conclusively demonstrate the importance of indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which arise from social interactions, for social insect trait expression and evolution. I explain why these genetically based social effects are expected to be ubiquitous in social insects and I explain the relevance of the IGE framework, originally developed within quantitative genetics, for molecular genetic studies of social insect traits such as behaviour and caste. I discuss the problems of ignoring IGEs and relying solely on conventional direct genetic effect approaches. Finally, I discuss the strong potential of using the IGE approach and other more systems-level-focused approaches to complement conventional reductionist approaches in elucidating the genetic basis of social insect trait expression and evolution. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Gardner (2015) recently developed a model of a 'Genetical Theory of Multilevel Selection, which is a thoughtfully developed, but flawed model. The model's flaws appear to be symptomatic of common misunderstandings of the multi level selection (MLS) literature and the recent quantitative genetic literature. I use Gardner's model as a guide for highlighting how the MLS literature can address the misconceptions found in his model, and the kin selection literature in general. I discuss research on the efficacy of group selection, the roll of indirect genetic effects in affecting the response to selection and the heritability of group-level traits. I also discuss why the Price multilevel partition should not be used to partition MLS, and why contextual analysis and, by association, direct fitness are appropriate for partitioning MLS. Finally, I discuss conceptual issues around questions concerning the level at which fitness is measured, the units of selection, and I present a brief outline of a model of selection in class-structured populations. I argue that the results derived from the MLS research tradition can inform kin selection research and models, and provide insights that will allow researchers to avoid conceptual flaws such as those seen in the Gardner model. © 2015 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract={The caste fate of developing female honey bee larvae is strictly socially regulated by adult nurse workers. As a result of this social regulation, nurse-expressed genes as well as larval-expressed genes may affect caste expression and evolution. We used a novel transcriptomic approach to identify genes with putative direct and indirect effects on honey bee caste development, and we subsequently studied the relative rates of molecular evolution at these caste-associated genes. We experimentally induced the production of new queens by removing the current colony queen, and we used RNA sequencing to study the gene expression profiles of both developing larvae and their caregiving nurses before and after queen removal. By comparing the gene expression profiles of queen-destined versus worker-destined larvae as well as nurses observed feeding these two types of larvae, we identified larval and nurse genes associated with caste development. Of 950 differentially expressed genes associated with caste, 82% were expressed in larvae with putative direct effects on larval caste, and 18% were expressed in nurses with putative indirect effects on caste. Estimated selection coefficients suggest that both nurse and larval genes putatively associated with caste are rapidly evolving, especially those genes associated with worker development. Altogether, our results suggest that indirect effect genes play important roles in both the expression and evolution of socially influenced traits such as caste. © 2015 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Phenotypes expressed in a social context are not only a function of the individual, but can also be shaped by the phenotypes of social partners. These social effects may play a major role in the evolution of cooperative breeding if social partners differ in the quality of care they provide and if individual carers adjust their effort in relation to that of other carers. When applying social effects models to wild study systems, it is also important to explore sources of individual plasticity that could masquerade as social effects. We studied offspring provisioning rates of parents and helpers in a wild population of long-tailed tits Aegithalos caudatus using a quantitative genetic framework to identify these social effects and partition them into genetic, permanent environment and current environment components. Controlling for other effects, individuals were consistent in their provisioning effort at a given nest, but adjusted their effort based on who was in their social group, indicating the presence of social effects. However, these social effects differed between years and social contexts, indicating a current environment effect, rather than indicating a genetic or permanent environment effect. While this study reveals the importance of examining environmental and genetic sources of social effects, the framework we present is entirely general, enabling a greater understanding of potentially important social effects within any ecological population. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={There is mounting evidence that inbreeding can have detrimental effects on the fitness of outbred individuals that interact with or depend on inbred individuals. However, little is currently known about the behavioral mechanisms by which interactions with inbred individuals induce fitness costs in outbred individuals. Here, we study effects of inbreeding on the behavioral dynamics of biparental cooperation in the burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. To this end, we used a two-by-two factorial design, in which an inbred or outbred female was mated to an inbred or an outbred male and tested for effects on cooperation between male and female parents providing care for their joint offspring. We found no evidence that inbred parents provided less care than outbred parents. Nevertheless, partners of inbred parents increased the amount of care they provided, leading to overcompensation. Our study shows that inbreeding can have strong and complex effects on the behavioral dynamics of biparental cooperation and that these effects are mediated mainly through changes in the partner’s behavior. We suggest that similar effects of inbreeding on outbred individuals may extend to other social contexts, such as cooperative breeding and mating. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Existing insight suggests that maternal effects have a substantial impact on evolution, yet these predictions assume that maternal effects themselves are evolutionarily constant. Hence, it is poorly understood how natural selection shapes maternal effects in different ecological circumstances. To overcome this, the current study derives an evolutionary model of maternal effects in a quantitative genetics context. In constant environments, we show that maternal effects evolve to slight negative values that result in a reduction of the phenotypic variance (canalization). By contrast, in populations experiencing abrupt change, maternal effects transiently evolve to positive values for many generations, facilitating the transmission of beneficial maternal phenotypes to offspring. In periodically fluctuating environments, maternal effects evolve according to the autocorrelation between maternal and offspring environments, favoring positive maternal effects when change is slow, and negative maternal effects when change is rapid. Generally, the strongest maternal effects occur for traits that experience very strong selection and for which plasticity is severely constrained. By contrast, for traits experiencing weak selection, phenotypic plasticity enhances the evolutionary scope of maternal effects, although maternal effects attain much smaller values throughout. As weak selection is common, finding substantial maternal influences on offspring phenotypes may be more challenging than anticipated. © 2015 The Author(s).},

abstract={Sexual selection acting on small initial differences in mating signals and mate preferences can enhance signal-preference codivergence and reproductive isolation during speciation. However, the origin of initial differences in sexual traits remains unclear. We asked whether biotic environments, a source of variation in sexual traits, may provide a general solution to this problem. Specifically, we asked whether genetic variation in biotic environments provided by host plants can result in signal-preference phenotypic covariance in a host-specific, plant-feeding insect. We used a member of the Enchenopa binotata species complex of treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to assess patterns of variation in male mating signals and female mate preferences induced by genetic variation in host plants. We employed a novel implementation of a quantitative genetics method, rearing field-collected treehoppers on a sample of naturally occurring replicated host plant clone lines. We found remarkably high signal-preference covariance among host plant genotypes. Thus, genetic variation in biotic environments influences the sexual phenotypes of organisms living on those environments in a way that promotes assortative mating among environments. This consequence arises from conditions likely to be common in nature (phenotypic plasticity and variation in biotic environments). It therefore offers a general answer to how divergent sexual selection may begin. © 2015 The Author(s).},

abstract={It has been proposed that niche and behavioral processes may promote the coexistence of alternative color morphs in discrete areas. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that alternative melanin-based phenotypes perform differently when co-occurring in breeding areas. We assessed the influence of microhabitat and social drivers on both the resulting nest-site distribution and the variation in reproductive success of interacting phenotypes of the colonial, color polymorphic Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae). We combined measures of social, behavioral, and breeding performance, as well as environmental variables under a spatially explicit approach. We found that alternative morphs were segregated over suitable habitats by forming permanent same-color clusters. This pattern was mainly due to social dominance relationships; the pale morph, which was less dominant but more aggressive than the dark morph, settled close to pale conspecifics but far from dark ones. This segregation was also influenced by the settling of dark morph males in less dense areas and at higher altitudes than pale ones. Although the timing of reproduction did not differ between morphs, the dark morph attained higher reproductive output during the study years. The evidence suggests that pale and dark falcons adopt different breeding strategies, with pale morphs behaving highly colonially and dark morphs being more territorial, yet their relative advantages depend on the environmental conditions. We suggest that balancing selection may act on such competitive asymmetries, likely contributing to the evolutionary stability and long-term maintenance of color polymorphism in wild populations. © The Author 2015.

abstract={Parents of many species provision their young, and the extent of parental provisioning constitutes a major component of the offspring’s social environment. Thus, a change in parental provisioning can alter selection on offspring, resulting in the coevolution of parental and offspring traits. Although this reasoning is central to our evolutionary understanding of family life, there is little direct evidence that selection by parents causes evolutionary change in their offspring. Here we use experimental evolution to examine how populations of burying beetles adapt to a change in posthatching parental provisioning. We measured the performance of larvae descended from lab populations that had been maintained with and without posthatching parental care (Full Care and No Care populations). We found that adaptation to the absence of posthatching care led to rapid and consistent changes in larval survival in the absence of care. Specifically, larvae from No Care populations had higher survival in the absence of care than larvae from Full Care populations. Other measures of larval performance, such as the ability of larvae to consume a breeding carcass and larval mass at dispersal, did not differ between the Full Care and No Care populations. Nevertheless, our results show that populations can adapt rapidly to a change in the extent of parental care and that experimental evolution can be used to study such adaptation. © 2015 by The University of Chicago. 0003-0147/2015/18505-55692$15.00.

abstract={Pigs living in intensive husbandry systems may experience both acute and chronic stress through standard management procedures and limitations in their physical and social environment, which may have implications for their immune status. Here, the effect of a new breeding method where pigs were selected on their heritable influence on their pen mates' growth, and environmental enrichment on the immune status of pigs was investigated. Hereto, 240 pigs with a relatively positive genetic effect on the growth of their pen mates (+SBV) and 240 pigs with a relatively negative genetic effect on the growth of their pen mates (2SBV) were housed in barren or straw-enriched pens from 4 to 23 weeks of age (n = 80 pens in total). A blood sample was taken from the pigs before, three days after a 24 h regrouping test, and at week 22. In addition, effects of coping style, as assessed in a backtest, and gender were also investigated. Mainly, +SBV were found to have lower leukocyte, lymphocyte and haptoglobin concentrations than -SBV pigs. Enriched housed pigs had a lower neutrophil to lymphocyte (N:L) ratio and lower haptoglobin concentrations, but had higher antibody titers specific for Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) than barren housed pigs. No interactions were found between SBV class and housing. Furthermore, pigs with a proactive coping style had higher alternative complement activity and, in the enriched pens, higher antibody titers specific for KLH than pigs with a reactive coping style. Lastly, females tended to have lower leukocyte, but higher haptoglobin concentrations than castrated males. Overall, these results suggest that +SBV pigs and enriched housed pigs were less affected by stress than -SBV and barren housed pigs, respectively. Moreover, immune activation might be differently organized in individuals with different coping styles and to a lesser extent in individuals of opposite genders. © 2014 Reimert et al.},

abstract={Androstenone is one of the compounds causing boar taint of pork and is highly heritable (approximately 0.6). Recently, indirect genetic effects (IGE; also known as associative effects or social genetic effects) were found for androstenone, meaning that pen mates (boars) affect each other’s androstenone level genetically. Similar to estimating variance components with a direct-indirect animal model, direct and indirect genetic SNP effects can be estimated for androstenone. This study aims to detect SNP with significant direct genetic effects and IGE on androstenone. The dataset consisted of 1,282 noncastrated boars (993 boars genotyped) from 184 groups of pen members. After quality control, 46,421 SNP were included in the analysis. One model for single-SNP regression was fitted, where both the direct SNP effect of the individual itself and the indirect SNP effects of its pen mates were included. None of the SNP (direct or indirect) were found genomewide significant. One QTL on SSC6 was chromosome-wide significant for the direct effect. A single SNP on SSC9 and 2 regions and a single SNP on SSC14 were found for the indirect effect. A backwards elimination method and haplotype analysis were used to quantify the variance explained by the SNP. The backwards elimination method identified 4 independent regions affecting androstenone. The QTL on SSC6 explained 2.1 and 2.6% of the phenotypic variance using the backwards elimination method or the haplotype analysis. The QTL on SSC14 explained 3.4 and 2.7% of the phenotypic variance using the backwards elimination method or the haplotype analysis. The single association on SSC9 explained 2.2% of the phenotypic variance. All significant QTL together explained 7 to 8% of phenotypic variance and 40 to 44% of the total genetic variance available for response to selection. Besides the newly discovered QTL and the confirmation of known QTL, this study also presents a methodology to model SNP for IGE. © 2014 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.},

The model includes parameters for the direct effects of the offspring genotype, maternal effects and the covariance between direct and maternal effects. Analysis of simulated data, conducted in OpenMx, confirmed that model parameters could be recovered by full information maximum likelihood (FIML) and evaluated the biases that arise in conventional GCTA when indirect genetic effects are ignored. Estimates derived from FIML in OpenMx showed very close agreement to those obtained by restricted maximum likelihood using the published algorithm for GCTA. The method was also applied to illustrative perinatal phenotypes from ~4,000 mother-offspring pairs from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.

abstract={Recent years have seen increasing interest in indirect genetic effects, i.e. influences on the phenotype that depend on the genotype of other conspecific individuals; however, the empirical evidence for such effects is still limited, especially in wild plant species. The present study of the clonal herb Sedum album assessed direct and indirect genetic effects on performance-related traits in a 4-year experiment with clonally replicated genotypes, grown in pairs and differing in anthocyanin pigmentation to allow separation of individuals during data collection. In agreement with the existence of indirect genetic effects, the experimentally-paired plants not only expressed their own genotype but were also affected by the genotype of their pair mate. The effect of neighbour genotype explained up to one-fourth of the variation in performance and most likely resulted from competition, imposed by the close physical contact between paired individuals and the limiting conditions used in the garden environment. Indirect genetic effects from competition have the potential to enhance the efficacy of group-level selection relative to individual selection, given the nutrient-poor and spatially-confined substrate available to plants of S. album in the natural habitat. © 2014 Stefan Andersson.},

abstract={Transgenerational effects are broader than only parental relationships. Despite mounting evidence that multigenerational effects alter phenotypic and life-history traits, our understanding of how they combine to determine fitness is not well developed because of the added complexity necessary to study them. Here, we derive a quantitative genetic model of adaptation to an extraordinary new environment by an additive genetic component, phenotypic plasticity, maternal and grandmaternal effects. We show how, at equilibrium, negative maternal and negative grandmaternal effects maximize expected population mean fitness. We define negative transgenerational effects as those that have a negative effect on trait expression in the subsequent generation, that is, they slow, or potentially reverse, the expected evolutionary dynamic. When maternal effects are positive, negative grandmaternal effects are preferred. As expected under Mendelian inheritance, the grandmaternal effects have a lower impact on fitness than the maternal effects, but this dual inheritance model predicts a more complex relationship between maternal and grandmaternal effects to constrain phenotypic variance and so maximize expected population mean fitness in the offspring. At equilibrium, negative maternal and negative grandmaternal effects maximise expected mean fitness. If, however, maternal effects are positive, negative grandmaternal effects maximise expected mean fitness. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={With global temperatures projected to surpass the limits of thermal tolerance for many species, evaluating the heritable variation underlying thermal tolerance is critical for understanding the potential for adaptation to climate change. We examined the evolutionary potential of thermal tolerance within a population of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) by conducting a full-factorial breeding design and measuring the thermal performance of cardiac function and the critical thermal maximum (CTmax) of offspring from each family. Additive genetic variation in offspring phenotype was mostly negligible, although these direct genetic effects explained 53% of the variation in resting heart rate (fH). Conversely, maternal effects had a significant influence on resting fH, scope for fH, cardiac arrhythmia temperature and CTmax. These maternal effects were associated with egg size, as indicated by strong relationships between the mean egg diameter of mothers and offspring thermal tolerance. Because egg size can be highly heritable in chinook salmon, our finding indicates that the maternal effects of egg size constitute an indirect genetic effect contributing to thermal tolerance. Such indirect genetic effects could accelerate evolutionary responses to the selection imposed by rising temperatures and could contribute to the population-specific thermal tolerance that has recently been uncovered among Pacific salmon populations. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Social dynamics, the emergent effects of interactions within structured groups, play a key role in shaping social phenotypes and fitness. We examined the potential positive and negative effects of social dynamics in simple groups, by creating social groups of harvester ant queens with 2 alternate nest-founding strategies, solitary versus cooperative. We compared social interactions, survival, and nest productivity of pairs containing queens from the cooperative founding population, the normally solitary founding population, or mixed pairs of the 2 types. Expressed social phenotypes of queens in pairs depended strongly on the lineage of the other queen. Two behaviors, aggression and brood care, showed simple social dynamical effects. Aggression escalated in pairs of normally solitary queens, whereas queens in cooperative pairs coordinated brood output, leading to more efficient worker production. These dynamics had context-based fitness consequences, such that cooperative queens gained a survival advantage in cooperative pairs, but neither type of queen experienced an advantage or disadvantage in "mixed" associations. The interplay between social dynamics and fitness in these associations provides an empirical example of social selection. It captures a likely scenario of the transition to and the early evolution of cooperative living, in which cooperative individuals interact with solitary individuals who lack a priori strategies for cooperation or cheating. © The Author 2013.},

abstract={Background: Social interactions often occur among living organisms, including aquatic animals. There is empirical evidence showing that social interactions may genetically affect phenotypes of individuals and their group mates. In this context, the heritable effect of an individual on the phenotype of another individual is known as an Indirect Genetic Effect (IGE). Selection for socially affected traits may increase response to artificial selection, but also affect rate of inbreeding. Methods. A simulation study was conducted to examine the effect of Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) selection for socially affected traits on the rate of inbreeding. A base scenario without IGE and three alternative scenarios with different magnitudes of IGE were simulated. In each generation, 25 sires and 50 dams were mated, producing eight progeny per dam. The population was selected for 20 generations using BLUP. Individuals were randomly assigned to groups of eight members in each generation, with two families per group, each contributing four individuals. " Heritabilities" (for both direct and indirect genetic effects) were equal to 0.1, 0.3 or 0.5, and direct-indirect genetic correlations were -0.8, -0.4, 0, 0.4, or 0.8. The rate of inbreeding was calculated from generation 10 to 20. Results: For the base scenario, the rates of inbreeding were 4.09, 2.80 and 1.95% for "heritabilities" of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5, respectively. Overall, rates of inbreeding for the three scenarios with IGE ranged from 2.21 to 5.76% and were greater than for the base scenarios. The results show that social interaction within groups of two families increases the resemblance between estimated breeding values of relatives, which, in turn, increases the rate of inbreeding. Conclusion: BLUP selection for socially affected traits increased the rate of inbreeding. To maintain inbreeding at an acceptable rate, a selection algorithm that restricts the increase in mean kinship, such as optimum contribution selection, is required. © 2014 Khaw et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Feather pecking is a major welfare issue in laying hen industry that leads to mortality. Due to a ban on conventional cages in the EU and on beak trimming in some countries of the EU, feather pecking will become an even bigger problem. Its severity depends both on the victim receiving pecking and on its group mates inflicting pecking (indirect effects), which together determine plumage condition of the victim. Plumage condition may depend, therefore, on both the direct genetic effect of an individual itself and on the indirect genetic effects of its group mates. Here, we present estimated genetic parameters for direct and indirect effects on plumage condition of different body regions in two purebred layer lines, and estimates of genetic correlations between body regions. Methods. Feather condition scores (FCS) were recorded at 40 weeks of age for neck, back, rump and belly and these four scores were added-up into a total FCS. A classical animal model and a direct-indirect effects model were used to estimate genetic parameters for FCS. In addition, a bivariate model with mortality (0/1) was used to account for mortality before recording FCS. Due to mortality during the first 23 weeks of laying, 5363 (for W1) and 5089 (for WB) FCS records were available. Results: Total heritable variance for FCS ranged from 1.5% to 9.8% and from 9.8% to 53.6% when estimated respectively with the classical animal and the direct-indirect effects model. The direct-indirect effects model had a significantly higher likelihood. In both lines, 70% to 94% of the estimated total heritable variation in FCS was due to indirect effects. Using bivariate analysis of FCS and mortality did not affect estimates of genetic parameters. Genetic correlations were high between adjacent regions for FCS on neck, back, and rump but moderate to low for belly with other regions. Conclusion: Our results show that 70% to 94% of the heritable variation in FCS relates to indirect effects, indicating that methods of genetic selection that include indirect genetic effects offer perspectives to improve plumage condition in laying hens. This, in turn could reduce a major welfare problem. © 2014 Brinker et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness revolutionized our understanding of the evolution of social interactions. Surprisingly, an incorporation of Hamilton's perspective into the quantitative genetic theory of phenotypic evolution has been slow, despite the popularity of quantitative genetics in evolutionary studies. Here, we discuss several versions of Hamilton's rule for social evolution from a quantitative genetic perspective, emphasizing its utility in empirical applications. Although evolutionary quantitative genetics offers methods to measure each of the critical parameters of Hamilton's rule, empirical work has lagged behind theory. In particular, we lack studies of selection on altruistic traits in the wild. Fitness costs and benefits of altruism can be estimated using a simple extension of phenotypic selection analysis that incorporates the traits of social interactants. We also discuss the importance of considering the genetic influence of the social environment, or indirect genetic effects (IGEs), in the context of Hamilton's rule. Research in social evolution has generated an extensive body of empirical work focusing-with good reason-almost solely on relatedness. We argue that quantifying the roles of social and non-social components of selection and IGEs, in addition to relatedness, is now timely and should provide unique additional insights into social evolution. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Background: Since the recommendations on group housing of mink (Neovison vison) were adopted by the Council of Europe in 1999, it has become common in mink production in Europe. Group housing is advantageous from a production perspective, but can lead to aggression between animals and thus raises a welfare issue. Bite marks on the animals are an indicator of this aggressive behaviour and thus selection against frequency of bite marks should reduce aggression and improve animal welfare. Bite marks on one individual reflect the aggression of its group members, which means that the number of bite marks carried by one individual depends on the behaviour of other individuals and that it may have a genetic basis. Thus, for a successful breeding strategy it could be crucial to consider both direct (DGE) and indirect (IGE) genetic effects on this trait. However, to date no study has investigated the genetic basis of bite marks in mink. Result and discussion. A model that included DGE and IGE fitted the data significantly better than a model with DGE only, and IGE contributed a substantial proportion of the heritable variation available for response to selection. In the model with IGE, the total heritable variation expressed as the proportion of phenotypic variance (T2) was six times greater than classical heritability (h 2). For instance, for total bite marks, T2 was equal to 0.61, while h 2 was equal to 0.10. The genetic correlation between direct and indirect effects ranged from 0.55 for neck bite marks to 0.99 for tail bite marks. This positive correlation suggests that mink have a tendency to fight in a reciprocal way (giving and receiving bites) and thus, a genotype that confers a tendency to bite other individuals can also cause its bearer to receive more bites. Conclusion: Both direct and indirect genetic effects contribute to variation in number of bite marks in group-housed mink. Thus, a genetic selection design that includes both direct genetic and indirect genetic effects could reduce the frequency of bite marks and probably aggression behaviour in group-housed mink. © 2014 Alemu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Background: Identifying the sources of variation in mating interactions between males and females is important because this variation influences the strength and/or the direction of sexual selection that populations experience. While the origins and effects of variation in male attractiveness and ornamentation have received much scrutiny, the causes and consequences of intraspecific variation in females have been relatively overlooked. We used cytogenetic cloning techniques developed for Drosophila melanogaster to create "hemiclonal" males and females with whom we directly observed sexual interaction between individuals of different known genetic backgrounds and measured subsequent reproductive outcomes. Using this approach, we were able to quantify the genetic contribution of each mate to the observed phenotypic variation in biologically important traits including mating speed, copulation duration, and subsequent offspring production, as well as measure the magnitude and direction of intersexual genetic correlation between female choosiness and male attractiveness. Results: We found significant additive genetic variation contributing to mating speed that can be attributed to male genetic identity, female genetic identity, but not their interaction. Furthermore we found that phenotypic variation in copulation duration had a significant male-associated genetic component. Female genetic identity and the interaction between male and female genetic identity accounted for a substantial amount of the observed phenotypic variation in egg size. Although previous research predicts a trade-off between egg size and fecundity, this was not evident in our results. We found a strong negative genetic correlation between female choosiness and male attractiveness, a result that suggests a potentially important role for sexually antagonistic alleles in sexual selection processes in our population. Conclusion: These results further our understanding of sexual selection because they identify that genetic identity plays a significant role in phenotypic variation in female behaviour and fecundity. This variation may be potentially due to ongoing sexual conflict found between the sexes for interacting phenotypes. Our unexpected observation of a negative correlation between female choosiness and male attractiveness highlights the need for more explicit theoretical models of genetic covariance to investigate the coevolution of female choosiness and male attractiveness. © 2014 Tennant et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Social selection and indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are established concepts in both behavioural ecology and evolutionary genetics. While IGEs describe effects of an individual's genotype on phenotypes of social partners (and may thus affect their fitness indirectly), the concept of social selection assumes that a given phenotype in one individual affects the fitness of other individuals directly. Although different frameworks, both have been used to investigate the evolution of social traits, such as cooperative behaviour. Despite their similarities (both concepts consider interactions among individuals), they differ in the type of interaction. It remains unclear whether the two concepts make the same predictions about evolutionary trajectories or not. To address this question, we investigate four possible scenarios of social interactions and compare the effects of IGEs and social selection for trait evolution in a multi-trait multi-member model. We show that the two mechanisms can yield similar evolutionary outcomes and that both can create selection pressure at the group level. However, the effect of IGEs can be stronger due to the possibility of feedback loops. Finally, we demonstrate that IGEs, but not social selection gradients, may lead to differences in the direction of evolutionary response between genotypes and phenotypes. © 2013 The Author(s).},

abstract={In social species, the phenotype and fitness of an individual depend in part on the genotype of its social partners. However, how these indirect genetic effects affect genotype fitness in competitive situations is poorly understood in animal societies. We therefore studied phenotypic plasticity and fitness of two clones of the ant Cerapachys biroi in monoclonal and chimeric colonies. Here we show that, while clone B has lower fitness in isolation, surprisingly, it consistently outcompetes clone A in chimeras. The reason is that, in chimeras, clone B produces more individuals specializing in reproduction rather than cooperative tasks, behaving like a facultative social parasite. A cross-fostering experiment shows that the proportion of these individuals depends on intergenomic epistasis between larvae and nursing adults, explaining the flexible allocation strategy of clone B. Our results suggest that intergenomic epistasis can be the proximate mechanism for social parasitism in ants, revealing striking analogies between social insects and social microbes.©2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={Background: Genetic selection for host resistance offers a desirable complement to chemical treatment to control infectious disease in livestock. Quantitative genetics disease data frequently originate from field studies and are often binary. However, current methods to analyse binary disease data fail to take infection dynamics into account. Moreover, genetic analyses tend to focus on host susceptibility, ignoring potential variation in infectiousness, i.e. the ability of a host to transmit the infection. This stands in contrast to epidemiological studies, which reveal that variation in infectiousness plays an important role in the progression and severity of epidemics. In this study, we aim at filling this gap by deriving an expression for the probability of becoming infected that incorporates infection dynamics and is an explicit function of both host susceptibility and infectiousness. We then validate this expression according to epidemiological theory and by simulating epidemiological scenarios, and explore implications of integrating this expression into genetic analyses. Results: Our simulations show that the derived expression is valid for a range of stochastic genetic-epidemiological scenarios. In the particular case of variation in susceptibility only, the expression can be incorporated into conventional quantitative genetic analyses using a complementary log-log link function (rather than probit or logit). Similarly, if there is moderate variation in both susceptibility and infectiousness, it is possible to use a logarithmic link function, combined with an indirect genetic effects model. However, in the presence of highly infectious individuals, i.e. super-spreaders, the use of any model that is linear in susceptibility and infectiousness causes biased estimates. Thus, in order to identify super-spreaders, novel analytical methods using our derived expression are required. Conclusions: We have derived a genetic-epidemiological function for quantitative genetic analyses of binary infectious disease data, which, unlike current approaches, takes infection dynamics into account and allows for variation in host susceptibility and infectiousness. © 2013 Lipschutz-Powell et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Predicting the response of communities and ecosystems to range shifts as a consequence of global climate change is a critical challenge confronting modern evolutionary ecologists. Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when the expression of genes in a conspecific neighbouring species affects the phenotype of a focal species, and the same concept applies for interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGEs) except that the neighbouring species is then required to be heterospecific. Theory and empirical data indicate that indirect genetic effects and interspecific indirect genetic effects have fundamental roles in understanding the consequences of genotypic diversity, evolutionary feedbacks, the co-evolutionary process and coadaptation and are a primary mechanism for the broad ecological and evolutionary dynamics that are likely to be a consequence of climate change. When indirect genetic effects and interspecific indirect genetic effects occur along environmental gradients, both positive and negative feedbacks can evolve, resulting in regions of strong local adaptation and competition as well as regions of complementarity and facilitation. Such evolutionary dynamics have direct consequences for how individuals interact and evolve in mixture and drive the services ecosystems provide. Integrating indirect genetic effects and interspecific indirect genetic effects, feedbacks and diversity effects along environmental gradients represents a major conceptual, theoretical and empirical frontier that must be considered to understand the whole-system consequences of climate change on biodiversity and the services ecosystems provide. © 2013 The Authors.

abstract={Social interactions among individuals are widespread, both in natural and domestic populations. As a result, trait values of individuals may be affected by genes in other individuals, a phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects (IGEs). IGEs can be estimated using linear mixed models. The traditional IGE model assumes that an individual interacts equally with all its partners, whether kin or strangers. There is abundant evidence, however, that individuals behave differently towards kin as compared with strangers, which agrees with predictions from kin-selection theory. With a mix of kin and strangers, therefore, IGEs estimated from a traditional model may be incorrect, and selection based on those estimates will be suboptimal. Here we investigate whether genetic parameters for IGEs are statistically identifiable in group-structured populations when IGEs differ between kin and strangers, and develop models to estimate such parameters. First, we extend the definition of total breeding value and total heritable variance to cases where IGEs depend on relatedness. Next, we show that the full set of genetic parameters is not identifiable when IGEs differ between kin and strangers. Subsequently, we present a reduced model that yields estimates of the total heritable effects on kin, on non-kin and on all social partners of an individual, as well as the total heritable variance for response to selection. Finally we discuss the consequences of analysing data in which IGEs depend on relatedness using a traditional IGE model, and investigate group structures that may allow estimation of the full set of genetic parameters when IGEs depend on kin. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract={Background: The aim of the study was to estimate genetic parameters for direct and social genetic effects (SGE) for growth and welfare traits in farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). A SGE refers to the effect of an individual's genes on trait performance of its social partners. In total, 2100 individually tagged juveniles from 100 families at an average age of 222 days post-hatching were used. Each family was separated into three groups of seven fish, and were randomly assigned to 100 experimental tanks, together with fish from two other families. Body weight and length of the first, second and third dorsal fin and the caudal fin measured by digital image analysis were measured at the start of the experiment, after two weeks, and after six weeks. Fin erosion was scored subjectively after six weeks. Variance components estimated using a conventional animal model were compared to those of an animal model including a SGE. Results: Heritabilities from the conventional animal model ranged from 0.24 to 0.34 for body weight and 0.05 to 0.80 for fin length. Heritabilities for fin erosion were highest for the first dorsal fin (0.83 ± 0.08, mean ± standard error) and lowest for the third dorsal fin (0.01 ± 0.04). No significant SGE were found for body weight, whereas SGE for fin lengths were significant after two and six weeks. Contributions to the total heritable variance were equal to 21.5% (6.1 ± 2.1) for the direct effect, 33.1% (9.4 ± 3.2) for the direct-social covariance, and 45.4% (12.9 ± 4.1) for the social variance for length of the first dorsal fin. For fin erosion, SGE were only significant for the second and third dorsal fin. Conclusions: Including SGE for fin length and fin erosion in the animal model increased the estimated heritable variation. However, estimates of total heritable variances were inaccurate and a larger experiment is needed to accurately quantify total heritable variance. Despite this, our results demonstrate that considering social breeding values for fin length or fin erosion when selecting fish will enable us to improve response to selection for welfare traits in Atlantic cod juveniles. © 2014 Nielsen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

For example, laying hens may develop feather pecking, which can cause mortality due to cannibalism, and pigs may develop tail biting or excessive aggression. Several studies have shown that social interactions affect the genetic variation in a trait. Genetic improvement of socially-affected traits, however, has proven to be difficult until relatively recently. The use of classical selection methods, like individual selection, may result in selection responses opposite to expected, because these methods neglect the effect of an individual on its group mates (social genetic effects). It has become clear that improvement of socially-affected traits requires selection methods that take into account not only the direct effect of an individual on its own phenotype but also the social genetic effects, also known as indirect genetic effects, of an individual on the phenotypes of its group mates. Here, we review the theoretical and empirical work on social genetic effects, with a focus on livestock. First, we present the theory of social genetic effects. Subsequently, we evaluate the evidence for social genetic effects in livestock and other species, by reviewing estimates of genetic parameters for direct and social genetic effects. Then we describe the results of different selection experiments. Finally, we discuss issues concerning the implementation of social genetic effects in livestock breeding programs. This review demonstrates that selection for socially-affected traits, using methods that target both the direct and social genetic effects, is a promising, but sometimes difficult to use in practice, tool to simultaneously improve production and welfare in livestock. © 2014 Ellen, Rodenburg, Albers, Bolhuis, Camerlink, Duijvesteijn, Knol, Muir, Peeters, Reimert, Sell-Kubiak, van Arendonk, Visscher and Bijma.},

abstract={Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are heritable effects of an individual on phenotypic values of others, and may result from social interactions. We determined the behavioural consequences of selection for IGEs for growth (IGEg) in pigs in a G × E treatment design. Pigs (n = 480) were selected for high versus low IGEg with a contrast of 14 g average daily gain and were housed in either barren or straw-enriched pens (n = 80). High IGEg pigs showed from 8 to 23 weeks age 40 % less aggressive biting (P = 0.006), 27 % less ear biting (P = 0.03), and 40 % less biting on enrichment material (P = 0.005). High IGEg pigs had a lower tail damage score (high 2.0; low 2.2; P = 0.004), and consumed 30 % less jute sacks (P = 0.002). Selection on high IGEg reduced biting behaviours additive to the, generally much larger, effects of straw-bedding (P < 0.01), with no G × E interactions. These results show opportunities to reduce harmful biting behaviours in pigs. © 2014, The Author(s).},

abstract={Production traits such as growth rate may depend on the social interactions between group members. These social interactions may be partly heritable and are referred to as indirect genetic effects (IGE) or social, associative, or competitive genetic effects. Indirect genetic effects may contribute to heritable variation in traits and can therefore be used to increase the response to selection. This, however, has hardly been tested by selection experiments. Our objective was to determine the effects of 1 generation of selection on IGE for growth (IGEg) in pigs on ADG, BW, ADFI, feed efficiency, and postmortem measurements. Sires (n = 24) and dams (n = 64) were selected to create a high vs. low contrast for IGEg in the offspring (n = 480). The IGE difference was 2.8 g ADG per pen mate, corresponding to 14 g higher ADG in high IGEg offspring compared to low IGEg offspring when housed in groups of 6 (i.e., (6 - 1) × 2.8 = 14). Male (barrows) and female (gilts) offspring were housed in groups of 6 of the same IGEg classification, in either barren concrete pens or pens enriched with straw and wood shavings (n = 80 pens). Pigs were followed from birth to slaughter. Data were analyzed in a mixed model with pen as random factor. There was no difference in ADG between high and low IGEg pigs during the finishing period (wk 10 to 23). Opposite to expectations, high IGEg tended to have a 17 g lower ADG from weaning to slaughter (P = 0.08), which was caused by a higher BW of low IGEg pigs in wk 5 (P = 0.008). This led to a 2.3 kg lower carcass weight (P = 0.02) and 2.2 mm less muscle depth for high IGEg pigs (P = 0.03). High IGEg pigs had a higher stomach wall damage score (P = 0.01). Pigs on straw had a 25 g lower ADG during finishing (P = 0.03) and less stomach wall damage (P < 0.001). Fewer interventions against harmful behavior were required in high IGEg pigs. The unexpected results regarding IGEg may be due to several reasons. Despite initial power calculations showing good power, the IGEg contrast between groups may have been too small. Moreover, measures that were taken to limit harmful behavior may have had a substantial role. Harmful behavior such as tail biting may affect ADG and might underlie the effects of selection on IGEg in pigs. Research under commercial circumstances, where harmful behavior is likely to be more profound, may give more accurate insight into the benefits of selecting for IGEg. © 2014 American Society of Animal Science.

abstract={Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one individual alter the phenotype of an interacting partner. IGEs can dramatically affect the expression and evolution of social traits. However, the interacting phenotype(s) through which they are transmitted are often unknown, or cryptic, and their detection would enhance our ability to accurately predict evolutionary change. To illustrate this challenge and possible solutions to it, we assayed male leg-tapping behavior using inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster paired with a common focal male strain. The expression of tapping in focal males was dependent on the genotype of their interacting partner, but this strong IGE was cryptic. Using a multiple-regression approach, we identified male startle response as a candidate interacting phenotype: the longer it took interacting males to settle after being startled, the less focal males tapped them. A genome-wide association analysis identified approximately a dozen candidate protein-coding genes potentially underlying the IGE, of which the most significant was slowpoke. Our methodological framework provides information about candidate phenotypes and candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms that underpin a strong yet cryptic IGE. We discuss how this approach can facilitate the detection of cryptic IGEs contributing to unusual evolutionary dynamics in other study systems. © 2014 The Authors.

abstract={Indirect genetic effects (IGE) occur when the genotype of an individual affects the phenotypic trait value of another conspecific individual. IGEs can have profound effects on both the magnitude and the direction of response to selection. Models of inheritance and response to selection in traits subject to IGEs have been developed within two frameworks; a trait-based framework in which IGEs are specified as a direct consequence of individual trait values, and a variance-component framework in which phenotypic variance is decomposed into a direct and an indirect additive genetic component. This work is a selective review of the quantitative genetics of traits affected by IGEs, with a focus on modelling, estimation and interpretation issues. It includes a discussion on variance-component vs trait-based models of IGEs, a review of issues related to the estimation of IGEs from field data, including the estimation of the interaction coefficient Ψ (psi), and a discussion on the relevance of IGEs for response to selection in cases where the strength of interaction varies among pairs of individuals. An investigation of the trait-based model shows that the interaction coefficient Ψ may deviate considerably from the corresponding regression coefficient when feedback occurs. The increasing research effort devoted to IGEs suggests that they are a widespread phenomenon, probably particularly in natural populations and plants. Further work in this field should considerably broaden our understanding of the quantitative genetics of inheritance and response to selection in relation to the social organisation of populations. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={Summary: Phenotypes are often environmentally dependent, which requires organisms to track environmental change. The challenge for organisms is to construct phenotypes using the most accurate environmental cue. Here, we use a quantitative genetic model of adaptation by additive genetic variance, within- and transgenerational plasticity via linear reaction norms and indirect genetic effects respectively. We show how the relative influence on the eventual phenotype of these components depends on the predictability of environmental change (fast or slow, sinusoidal or stochastic) and the developmental lag τ between when the environment is perceived and when selection acts. We then decompose expected mean fitness into three components (variance load, adaptation and fluctuation load) to study the fitness costs of within- and transgenerational plasticity. A strongly negative maternal effect coefficient m minimizes the variance load, but a strongly positive m minimises the fluctuation load. The adaptation term is maximized closer to zero, with positive or negative m preferred under different environmental scenarios. Phenotypic plasticity is higher when τ is shorter and when the environment changes frequently between seasonal extremes. Expected mean population fitness is highest away from highest observed levels of phenotypic plasticity. Within- and transgenerational plasticity act in concert to deliver well-adapted phenotypes, which emphasizes the need to study both simultaneously when investigating phenotypic evolution. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Ongoing evolution of polyandry, and consequent extra-pair reproduction in socially monogamous systems, is hypothesized to be facilitated by indirect selection stemming from cross-sex genetic covariances with components of male fitness. Specifically, polyandry is hypothesized to create positive genetic covariance with male paternity success due to inevitable assortative reproduction, driving ongoing coevolution. However, it remains unclear whether such covariances could or do emerge within complex polyandrous systems. First, we illustrate that genetic covariances between female extra-pair reproduction and male within-pair paternity success might be constrained in socially monogamous systems where female and male additive genetic effects can have opposing impacts on the paternity of jointly reared offspring. Second, we demonstrate nonzero additive genetic variance in female liability for extra-pair reproduction and male liability for within-pair paternity success, modeled as direct and associative genetic effects on offspring paternity, respectively, in free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). The posterior mean additive genetic covariance between these liabilities was slightly positive, but the credible interval was wide and overlapped zero. Therefore, although substantial total additive genetic variance exists, the hypothesis that ongoing evolution of female extra-pair reproduction is facilitated by genetic covariance with male within-pair paternity success cannot yet be definitively supported or rejected either conceptually or empirically. © 2014 The Author(s).

abstract={Many species spend their lives in close association with other organisms, and the environments provided by those organisms can play an important role as causes of variation in phenotypes. When this is the case, the genotypes of the individuals constituting the environment may influence the phenotypes of individuals living in that environment. When these effects are between heterospecifics, interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGEs) occur. Several studies have detected IIGEs, but whether IIGEs contribute to variation in sexually selected traits remains virtually unexplored.We assessed how mate preferences in a plant-feeding insect are influenced by the genotype of their host plant. We established clone lines of a sample of host plant genotypes constituting the background biotic environment for a random sample of insects that we reared on them. We found that the insects’ mate preferences varied according to the clone line on which they developed. These results demonstrate that genetic variation in host plants has cross-trophic consequences on a trait that has strong effects on fitness and interpopulation dynamics such as diversification in communication systems. We discuss how IIGEs on mate preferences may influence the way in which selection acts, including the maintenance of variation and the promotion of evolutionary divergence. © 2014 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Competition among individuals is central to our understanding of ecology and population dynamics. However, it could also have major implications for the evolution of resource-dependent life history traits (for example, growth, fecundity) that are important determinants of fitness in natural populations. This is because when competition occurs, the phenotype of each individual will be causally influenced by the phenotypes, and so the genotypes, of competitors. Theory tells us that indirect genetic effects arising from competitive interactions will give rise to the phenomenon of 'evolutionary environmental deterioration', and act as a source of evolutionary constraint on resource-dependent traits under natural selection. However, just how important this constraint is remains an unanswered question. This article seeks to stimulate empirical research in this area, first highlighting some patterns emerging from life history studies that are consistent with a competition-based model of evolutionary constraint, before describing several quantitative modelling strategies that could be usefully applied. A recurrent theme is that rigorous quantification of a competition's impact on life history evolution will require an understanding of the causal pathways and behavioural processes by which genetic (co)variance structures arise. Knowledge of the G-matrix among life history traits is not, in and of itself, sufficient to identify the constraints caused by competition. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={As consumers and society in general become more aware of ethical and moral dilemmas associated with intensive rearing systems, pressure is put on the animal and poultry industries to adopt alternative forms of housing. This presents challenges especially regarding managing competitive social interactions between animals. However, selective breeding programs are rapidly advancing, enhanced by both genomics and new quantitative genetic theory that offer potential solutions by improving adaptation of the bird to existing and proposed production environments. The outcomes of adaptation could lead to improvement of animal welfare by increasing fitness of the animal for the given environments, which might lead to increased contentment and decreased distress of birds in those systems. Genomic selection, based on dense genetic markers, will allow for more rapid improvement of traits that are expensive or difficult to measure, or have a low heritability, such as pecking, cannibalism, robustness, mortality, leg score, bone strength, disease resistance, and thus has the potential to address many poultry welfare concerns. Recently selection programs to include social effects, known as associative or indirect genetic effects (IGEs), have received much attention. Group, kin, multi-level, and multi-trait selection including IGEs have all been shown to be highly effective in reducing mortality while increasing productivity of poultry layers and reduce or eliminate the need for beak trimming. Multi-level selection was shown to increases robustness as indicated by the greater ability of birds to cope with stressors. Kin selection has been shown to be easy to implement and improve both productivity and animal well-being. Management practices and rearing conditions employed for domestic animal production will continue to change based on ethical and scientific results. However, the animal breeding tools necessary to provide an animal that is best adapted to these changing conditions are readily available and should be used, which will ultimately lead to the best possible outcomes for all impacted. © 2014 Muir, Cheng and Croney.},

abstract={Infectious diseases have a major role in evolution by natural selection and pose a worldwide concern in livestock. Understanding quantitative genetics of infectious diseases, therefore, is essential both for understanding the consequences of natural selection and for designing artificial selection schemes in agriculture. The basic reproduction ratio, R 0, is the key parameter determining risk and severity of infectious diseases. Genetic improvement for control of infectious diseases in host populations should therefore aim at reducing R 0. This requires definitions of breeding value and heritable variation for R 0, and understanding of mechanisms determining response to selection. This is challenging, as R 0 is an emergent trait arising from interactions among individuals in the population. Here we show how to define breeding value and heritable variation for R 0 for genetically heterogeneous host populations. Furthermore, we identify mechanisms determining utilization of heritable variation for R 0. Using indirect genetic effects, next-generation matrices and a SIR (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered) model, we show that an individual's breeding value for R 0 is a function of its own allele frequencies for susceptibility and infectivity and of population average susceptibility and infectivity. When interacting individuals are unrelated, selection for individual disease status captures heritable variation in susceptibility only, yielding limited response in R 0. With related individuals, however, there is a secondary selection process, which also captures heritable variation in infectivity and additional variation in susceptibility, yielding substantially greater response. This shows that genetic variation in susceptibility represents an indirect genetic effect. As a consequence, response in R 0 increased substantially when interacting individuals were genetically related. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={W. D. Hamilton famously suggested that the inflated relatedness of full sisters under haplodiploidy explains why all workers in the social hymenoptera are female. This suggestion has not stood up to further theoretical scrutiny and is not empirically supported. Rather, it appears that altruistic sib-rearing in the social hymenoptera is performed exclusively by females because this behaviour has its origins in parental care, which was performed exclusively by females in the ancestors of this insect group. However, haplodiploidy might still explain the sex of workers if this mode of inheritance has itself been responsible for the rarity of paternal care in this group. Here, we perform a theoretical kin selection analysis to investigate the evolution of paternal care in diploid and haplodiploid populations. We find that haplodiploidy may either inhibit or promote paternal care depending on model assumptions, but that under the most plausible scenarios it promotes - rather than inhibits - paternal care. Our analysis casts further doubt upon there being a causal link between haplodiploidy and eusociality. © 2014 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract={Populations evolve in response to the external environment, whether abiotic (e.g., climate) or biotic (e.g., other conspecifics). We investigated how adaptation to biotic, heritable environments differs from adaptation to abiotic, nonheritable environments. We found that, for the same selection coefficients, the coadaptive process between genes and heritable environments is much faster than genetic adaptation to an abiotic nonheritable environment. The increased rate of adaptation results from the positive association generated by reciprocal selection between the heritable environment and the genes responding to it. These associations result in a runaway process of adaptive coevolution, even when the genes creating the heritable environment and genes responding to the heritable environment are unlinked. Although tightening the degree of linkage accelerates the coadaptive process, the acceleration caused by a comparable amount of inbreeding is greater, because inbreeding has a cumulative effect on reducing functional recombination over generations. Our results suggest that that adaptation to local abiotic environmental variation may result in the rapid diversification of populations and subsequent reproductive isolation not directly but rather via its effects on heritable environments and the genes responding to them. © The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

abstract={Together with the avoidance of any negative impact of inbreeding, preservation of genetic variability for life-history traits that could undergo future selective pressure is a major issue in endangered species management programmes. However, most of these programmes ignore that, apart from the direct action of genes on such traits, parents, as contributors of offspring environment, can influence offspring performance through indirect parental effects (when parental genotype and phenotype exerts environmental influences on offspring phenotype independently of additive genetic effects). Using quantitative genetic models, we estimated the additive genetic variance for juvenile survival in a population of the endangered Cuvier's gazelle kept in captivity since 1975. The dataset analyzed included performance recording for 700 calves and a total pedigree of 740 individuals. Results indicated that in this population juvenile survival harbors significant additive genetic variance. The estimates of heritability obtained were in general moderate (0.115-0.457) and not affected by the inclusion of inbreeding in the models. Maternal genetic contribution to juvenile survival seems to be of major importance in this gazelle's population as well. Indirect genetic and indirect environmental effects assigned to mothers (i.e., maternal genetic and maternal permanent environmental effects) roughly explain a quarter of the total variance estimated for the trait analyzed. These findings have major evolutionary consequences for the species as show that offspring phenotypes can evolve strictly through changes in the environment provided by mothers. They are also relevant for the captive breeding programme of the species. To take into account, the contribution that mothers have on offspring phenotype through indirect genetic effects when designing pairing strategies might serve to identify those females with better ability to recruit, and, additionally, to predict reliable responses to selection in the captive population. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={Social influences on mate choice are predicted to influence evolutionary divergence of closely related taxa, because of the key role mate choice plays in reproductive isolation. However, it is unclear whether females choosing between heterospecific and conspecific male signals use previously experienced social information in the same manner or to the same extent that they do when discriminating among conspecific mates only. We tested this using two field cricket sister species (Teleogryllus oceanicus and Teleogryllus commodus), in which considerable information is known about the role of male calling song in premating isolation, in addition to the influence of acoustic experience on the development of reproductive traits. We manipulated the acoustic experience of replicate populations of both species and found, unexpectedly, that experience of male calling song during rearing did not change how accurate females were in choosing a conspecific over a heterospecific male song during playback trials. However, females with acoustic experience were considerably less responsive to male song compared with naïve females. Our results suggest that variation in the acoustic environment affects mate choice in both species, but that it may have a limited impact on premating isolation. The fact that social flexibility during interspecific mate discrimination does not appear to operate identically to that which occurs during conspecific mate discrimination highlights the importance of considering the context in which animals exercise socially flexible mating behaviours. We suggest an explanation for why social flexibility might be context dependent and discuss the consequences of such flexibility for the evolution of reproductive isolation. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract={Maternal effects are powerful forces of adaptive evolution but their widespread implications, especially in human-disturbed environments, are still being realized. Here we examine the role of maternal effects in shaping fitness-related behaviour and life-history traits in black widow spiders, Latrodectus hesperus. We test the prediction that adult foraging success shapes maternal body condition, fecundity and egg investment, and that maternal prey abundance has a positive, cross-generational effect on a number of important offspring traits. Our results suggest that maternal foraging success is indeed translated into positive effects on maternal body condition, eggsac mass, egg number, egg mass, egg size, egg density and development rate. Maternal feeding had no effect on sibling cannibalism. Interestingly, despite the statistically significant effects of maternal food regime on offspring parameters listed above, some mothers in the high-food treatment nevertheless made low-density eggs and some mothers in the low-food treatment made high-density eggs. Thus, maternal egg investment, and several other life-history variables, were influenced by a family effect that cannot be explained solely by our manipulation of maternal foraging. For example, a strong effect of family on the latency to sibling cannibalism, in the absence of any link between maternal food regime, egg density and cannibalism, suggests that direct genetic effects, rather than maternal effects, may explain this fitness-related behavioural trait. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the behaviour, ecology and evolution of this and other arthropods, with particular reference to the possibility that maternal effects may facilitate rapid evolution to human-disturbed habitats. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Because of a ban on the use of beak trimming in some European countries, feather pecking is becoming a substantial problem in the layer industry, both from animal welfare and economic points of view. The feather condition score (FCS) as a measure of feather damage has been shown to be closely related to feather pecking behavior in laying hens housed in groups. To obtain a better understanding of genetic and other biological mechanisms underlying feather pecking behavior, data on FCS of a population of 2,724 female offspring from crossing 50 male W1 and 907 female WB purebred lines were used. The offspring of 25 sires were beak-trimmed, and the offspring of another 25 sires were non-beak-trimmed. Titers of plasma natural antibody (NAb) isotypes IgM and IgG binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin at 24 wk of age were measured. Feather condition was scored at 53 wk of age. In the first part of the present study, we estimated genetic parameters for FCS with 2 variance components models: A traditional linear animal model and a model combining direct and associative genetic effects. In the second part of the present study, a trait-based analysis for FCS was conducted to investigate whether NAb isotype titers can explain variation in FCS among individuals, by fitting a linear mixed model. Though the estimated associative genetic variance was substantial, associative effects for FCS were not statistically significant in both populations (P = 0.09 in beak-trimmed birds, and P = 0.08 in non-beak-trimmed birds). This suggests an insufficient number of records on FCS. Individual's NAb isotypes titers did not show direct effect for FCS of itself, but individual's IgG titers showed a suggestive effect on the FCS of cage mates (associative effect) in beak-trimmed laying hens, which need further confirmation. © 2014 Poultry Science Association Inc.},

abstract={Many reproductive traits that have evolved under sexual conflict may be influenced by both sexes. Investigation of the genetic architecture of such traits can yield important insight into their evolution, but this entails that the heritable component of variation is estimated for males and females-as an interacting phenotype. We address the lack of research in this area through an investigation of egg production and copula duration in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Despite egg production rate being determined by both sexes, which may cause sexual conflict, an assessment of this trait as an interacting phenotype is lacking. It is currently unclear whether copula duration is determined by males and/or females. We found significant female, but not male, genetic variance for egg production rate that may indicate reduced potential for ongoing sexually antagonistic coevolution. In contrast, copula duration was determined by significant genetic variance in both sexes. We also identified genetic variation in egg retention among virgin females. Although previously identified in wild populations, it is unclear why this should be present in a laboratory stock. This study provides a novel insight into the shared genetic architecture of reproductive traits that are the subject of sexual conflict. © 2014 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

abstract={Physiological and functional traits, especially those related to behavior and whole-organism performance capacities, are subject to a variety of both parallel and opposing natural and sexual selection pressures. These selection pressures show considerable interspecific variation, shaping contemporary behavioral and functional diversity, but the form and intensity of selection on physiological and functional traits can also vary intraspecifically. The same suites of traits can experience quite different selection pressures, depending on the sex or age of a given individual, as well as the presence and nature of alternative reproductive strategies and tactics. These inter- and intra-locus genetic conflicts have potentially important consequences for the evolutionary trajectories of traits subject to them. Consequently, any intraspecific conflicts which could displace traits from their selective optima in certain classes of individuals relative to others are expected to result in selection for mechanisms to compensate for deviation from those optima. Such conflicts include interlocus sexual conflict, intralocus sexual conflict, and interacting phenotypes, as well as conflict within a sex. In this paper, we consider the evidence for, and implications of, such conflicts for physiological and functional traits in diverse taxa, including both vertebrates and invertebrates, and evaluate the various mechanisms, ranging from behavioral and mechanical to energetic and genetic, enabling compensation. We also discuss how pre- and post-mating conflicts, as well as interacting phenotypes, might affect the evolution of behavior and physiological and functional traits. Investigators that seek to understand the links among behavior, morphology, physiology, and function should consider such conflicts. © 2014 Current Zoology.},

abstract={Disentangling the relative roles of males, females and their interactive effects on competitive fertilization success remains a challenge in sperm competition. In this study, we apply a novel experimental framework to an ideally suited externally fertilizing model system in order to delineate these roles. We focus on the chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, a species in which ovarian fluid (OF) has been implicated as a potential arbiter of cryptic female choice for genetically compatible mates. We evaluated this predicted sexually selected function of OF using a series of factorial competitive fertilization trials. Our design involved a series of 10 factorial crosses, each involving two 'focal' rival males whose sperm competed against those from a single 'standardized' (non-focal) rival for a genetically uniform set of eggs in the presence of OF from two focal females. This design enabled us to attribute variation in competitive fertilization success among focal males, females (OF) and their interacting effects, while controlling for variation attributable to differences in the sperm competitive ability of rival males, and male-by-female genotypic interactions. Using this experimental framework, we found that variation in sperm competitiveness could be attributed exclusively to differences in the sperm competitive ability of focal males, a conclusion supported by subsequent analyses revealing that variation in sperm swimming velocity predicts paternity success. Together, these findings provide evidence that variation in paternity success can be attributed to intrinsic differences in the sperm competitive ability of rival males, and reveal that sperm swimming velocity is a key target of sexual selection. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

abstract={Many social behaviors are triggered by social partners. For example, cells in a multicellular organism often become soma via extrinsically regulated differentiation, while individuals in a eusocial colony often become helpers via extrinsic caste determination. One explanation for social triggering is that it informs when it is beneficial to express the behavior. Alternatively, social triggering can represent manipulation where social partners partially or completely control the focal individual's behavior. For instance, caste determination in primitively eusocial taxa is typically accomplished via differential feeding or dominance hierarchies, suggesting some manipulation. However, selection would favor resistance if manipulation is detrimental to manipulated parties, and the outcome of the manipulation conflict remains intricate. We analyze the coevolution of manipulation and resistance in a simple but general setting.We show that, despite possible resistance, manipulated behavior can be established under less stringent conditions than spontaneous (i.e., nonmanipulated) behavior because of resistance costs. The existence of this advantage might explain why primitive eusocial behavior tends to be triggered socially and coercively.We provide a simple condition for the advantage of manipulated behavior that may help infer whether a socially triggered behavior is manipulated. We illustrate our analysis with a hypothetical example of maternal manipulation relevant to primitive eusociality. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Pigs housed together in a group influence each other's growth. Part of this effect is genetic and can be represented in a social breeding value. It is unknown, however, which traits are associated with social breeding values. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate whether personality and response to novelty could be associated with social breeding values for growth in piglets. Female and castrated male piglets from 80 litters, with either an estimated relative positive or negative social breeding value (+SBV or -SBV) for growth, were individually tested in a backtest and novel environment test, and group-wise in a novel object (i.e., a feeder with feed) test and human approach test. All tests were performed during the suckling period. No differences between +SBV and -SBV piglets were found for the frequency and latency of struggling and vocalizing in the backtest (at least. P > 0.30). In the novel object test, piglets with a +SBV for growth touched the feeder faster than piglets with -SBV for growth (P = 0.01) and were more frequently present near the person in the human approach test (P < 0.01). No behavioral differences between +SBV and -SBV piglets. were found in the novel environment test (at least. P > 0.40), but piglets that struggled more in the backtest walked more in this test (P = 0.02). Behavior was affected by gender in each test. Female piglets were faster than castrated male piglets to start struggling in the backtest (P = 0.047). In the novel object test, females were faster than males to touch the feeder and sample the feed. In the human approach test, they were also faster than male piglets to touch a person (all, P < 0.001). Females were also more frequently present near the feeder (P < 0.001) and person (P = 0.03). In the novel environment test, female piglets explored the floor more (P = 0.046), produced less low-(P = 0.04) and high-pitched vocalizations (P = 0.02). and defecated (P = 0.08) and urinated less than male piglets (P < 0.01). It was concluded that +SBV and-SBV piglets do not differ in their response to the backtest, and only subtle differences were found in their response to novelty. More research is warranted to identify the traits underlying SBV for growth in pigs. Moreover, castrated male piglets seemed to react more fearfully to each test than female piglets. © 2013 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) describe how an individual's behaviour-which is influenced by his or her genotype-can affect the behaviours of interacting individuals. IGE research has focused on dyads. However, insights from social networks research, and other studies of group behaviour, suggest that dyadic interactions are affected by the behaviour of other individuals in the group. To extend IGE inferences to groups of three or more, IGEs must be considered from a group perspective. Here, I introduce the 'focal interaction' approach to study IGEs in groups. I illustrate the utility of this approach by studying aggression among natural genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster. I chose two natural genotypes as 'focal interactants': the behavioural interaction between them was the 'focal interaction'. One male from each focal interactant genotype was present in every group, and I varied the genotype of the third male-the 'treatment male'. Genetic variation in the treatment male's aggressive behaviour influenced the focal interaction, demonstrating that IGEs in groups are not a straightforward extension of IGEs measured in dyads. Further, the focal interaction influenced male mating success, illustrating the role of IGEs in behavioural evolution. These results represent the first manipulative evidence for IGEs at the group level. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Patterns of phenotypic variation arise in part from plasticity owing to social interactions, and these patterns contribute, in turn, to the form of selection that shapes the variation we observe in natural populations. This proximate-ultimate dynamic brings genetic variation in social environments to the forefront of evolutionary theory. However, the extent of this variation remains largely unknown. Here, we use a member of the Enchenopa binotata species complex of treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to assess how mate preferences are influenced by genetic variation in the social environment. We used full-sibling split-families as 'treatment' social environments, and reared focal females alongside each treatment family, describing the mate pre-ferencesofthe focal females. With this method, wedetected substantial genetic variation in social influence on mate preferences. The mate preferences of focal females varied according to the treatment families along with which they grew up. We discuss the evolutionary implications of the presence of such genetic variation in social influence on mate preferences, including potential contributions to the maintenance of genetic variation, the promotion of divergence, and the adaptive evolution of social effects on fitness-related traits. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract={Structural equation models (SEMs) are multivariate specifications capable of conveying causal relationships among traits. Although these models offer insights into how phenotypic traits relate to each other, it is unclear whether and how they can improve multiple-trait selection. Here, we explored concepts involved in SEMs, seeking for benefits that could be brought to breeding programs, relative to the standard multitrait model (MTM) commonly used. Genetic effects pertaining to SEMs and MTMs have distinct meanings. In SEMs, they represent genetic effects acting directly on each trait, without mediation by other traits in the model; in MTMs they express overall genetic effects on each trait, equivalent to lumping together direct and indirect genetic effects discriminated by SEMs. However, in breeding programs the goal is selecting candidates that produce offspring with best phenotypes, regardless of how traits are causally associated, so overall additive genetic effects are the matter. Thus, no information is lost in standard settings by using MTM-based predictions, even if traits are indeed causally associated. Nonetheless, causal information allows predicting effects of external interventions. One may be interested in predictions for scenarios where interventions are performed, e.g., artificially defining the value of a trait, blocking causal associations, or modifying their magnitudes. We demonstrate that with information provided by SEMs, predictions for these scenarios are possible from data recorded under no interventions. Contrariwise, MTMs do not provide information for such predictions. As livestock and crop production involves interventions such as management practices, SEMs may be advantageous in many settings. © 2013 by the Genetics Society of America.},

abstract={Host-parasite interactions are a key paradigmfor understanding the process of coevolution. Central to coevolution is how genetic variation in interacting species allows parasites to evolve manipulative strategies. However, genetic variation in the parasite may also be associated with host phenotype changes, thereby changing the selection on both species. For instance, parasites often induce changes in the behaviour of their host to maximize their own fitness, yet the quantitative genetic basis for behavioural manipulation has not been fully demonstrated. Here, we show that the genotype of the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi has a significant effect on where its aphid host Acyrthosiphon pisum moves to die following parasitism, including the likelihood that the aphid abandons the plant.

abstract={Indirect Genetic Effects (IGEs), also known as associative effects, are the heritable effects that an individual has on the phenotype of its social partners. Selection for IGEs has been proposed as a method to reduce harmful behaviours, in particular aggression, in livestock and aquaculture. The mechanisms behind IGEs, however, have rarely been studied. The objective was therefore to assess aggression in pigs which were divergently selected for IGEs on growth (IGEg). In a one generation selection experiment, we studied 480 offspring of pigs (Sus scrofa) that were selected for relatively high or low IGEg and housed in homogeneous IGEg groups in either barren or enriched environments. Skin lesion scores, a proxy measure of aggression, and aggressive behaviours were recorded. The two distinct IGEg groups did not differ in number of skin lesions, or in amount of reciprocal fighting, both under stable social conditions and in confrontation with unfamiliar pigs in a 24 h regrouping test. Pigs selected for a positive effect on the growth of their group members, however, performed less non-reciprocal biting and showed considerably less aggression at reunion with familiar group members after they had been separated during a 24 h regrouping test. The enriched environment was associated with more skin lesions but less non-reciprocal biting under stable social conditions. Changes in aggression between pigs selected for IGEg were not influenced by G×E interactions with regard to the level of environmental enrichment. It is likely that selection on IGEg targets a behavioural strategy, rather than a single behavioural trait such as aggressiveness. © 2013 Camerlink et al.},

abstract={Intraspecific genetic variation can affect decomposition, nutrient cycling, and interactions between plants and their associated belowground communities. However, the effects of genetic variation on ecosystems can also be indirect, meaning that genes in a focal plant may affect ecosystems by altering the phenotype of interacting (i.e., neighboring) individuals. We manipulated genotype identity, species identity, and the possibility of belowground interactions between neighboring Solidago plants. We hypothesized that, because our plants were nitrogen (N) limited, the most important interactions between focal and neighbor plants would occur belowground. More specifically, we hypothesized that the genotypic identity of a plant's neighbor would have a larger effect on belowground biomass than on aboveground biomass, but only when neighboring plants were allowed to interact belowground. We detected species- and genotype-level variation for aboveground biomass and ramet production. We also found that belowground biomass and ramet production depended on the interaction of neighbor genotype identity and the presence or absence of belowground interactions. Additionally, we found that interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGEs; changes in focal plant traits due to the genotype identity of a heterospecific neighbor) had a greater effect size on belowground biomass than did focal genotype; however, this effect only held in pots that allowed belowground interactions. These results expand the types of natural processes that can be attributed to genotypes by showing that, under certain conditions, a plant's phenotype can be strongly determined by the expression of genes in its neighbor. By showing that IIGEs are dependent upon plants being able to interact belowground, our results also provide a first step for thinking about how genotype-based, belowground interactions influence the evolutionary outcomes of plant-neighbor interactions. © 2013 The Authors.

abstract={The genetic variance-covariance (G) matrix describes the variances and covariances of genetic traits under strict genetic inheritance. Genetically expressed traits often influence trait expression in another via nongenetic forms of transmission and inheritance, however. The importance of non-genetic influences on phenotypic evolution is increasingly clear, but how genetic and nongenetic inheritance interact to determine the response to selection is not well understood. Here, we use the 'reachability matrix' - a key analytical tool of geometric control theory - to integrate both forms of inheritance, capturing how the consequences of generation-lagged maternal effects accumulate. Building on the classic Lande and Kirkpatrick model that showed how nongenetic (maternal) inheritance fundamentally alters the expected path of phenotypic evolution, we make novel inferences through decomposition of the reachability matrix. In particular, we quantify how nongenetic inheritance affects the distribution (orientation and shape) of ellipses of phenotypic change and how these distributions influence subsequent evolution. This interweaving of phenotypic means and variances accumulates generation by generation and is described analytically by the reachability matrix, which acts as an analogue of G when genetic and nongenetic inheritance both act. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract={Mate choice often depends on the properties of both sexes, such as the preference and responsiveness of the female and the sexual display traits of the male. Quantitative genetic studies, however, traditionally explore the outcome of an interaction between males and females based solely on the genotype of one sex, treating the other sex as a source of environmental variance. Here, we use a half-sib breeding design in the field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus, to estimate the additive genetic contribution of both partners to three steps of the mate choice process: the time taken to mate; the duration of spermatophore attachment; and the intensity of mate guarding. Rather than each sex contributing equally to the interactions, we found that genetic variation for latency to mate and spermatophore attachment was sex-specific, and in the case of mate-guarding intensity, largely absent. For a given interaction, genetic variation in one sex also appears to be largely independent of the other, and is also uncorrelated with the other traits. We discuss how pre- and postcopulatory interactions have the potential to evolve as an interacting phenotype, but that any coevolution between these traits, due to sexual selection or sexual conflict, may be limited. © 2013 The Author(s).

In this paper, we focus on the recently proposed hypothesis that social niche specialization (i.e. individuals in a population occupy different social roles) can explain the maintenance of individual differences in personality. We first present ecological and social niche specialization hypotheses. In particular, we show how niche specialization can be quantified and highlight the link between personality differences and social niche specialization. We then review some ecological factors (e.g. competition and environmental heterogeneity) and the social mechanisms (e.g. frequency-dependent, state-dependent and social awareness) that may be associated with the evolution of social niche specialization and personality differences. Finally, we present a conceptual model and methods to quantify the contribution of ecological factors and social mechanisms to the dynamics between personality and social roles. In doing so, we suggest a series of research objectives to help empirical advances in this research area.

We then highlight that social plasticity in mate preferences creates feedback loops between the role of social environments as causes of variation in phenotypes and the role of social environments as causes of selection on phenotypes. Fully understanding the consequences of these feedbacks will involve assessing both how selection shapes the plastic response to variation in social environments and how individuals in social environments are selected to influence the mate preferences of others.

abstract={A complete understanding of male reproductive success, and thus sexual selection, often requires an insight into male success in sperm competition. Genuine conclusions on male sperm competitiveness can only be made in real competitive situations. However, statistical analyses of sperm competitiveness from fertilization success data have been shown to be problematic. Here, I first outline a comprehensive general description of the different additive and nonadditive elements relevant for the outcome of sperm competition staged between two males. Based on this description, I will highlight two main problems that are frequently encountered in experiments aiming at estimating sperm competitiveness. First, I focus on potential problems when using standardized competitors versus random mating trials, because trials with standardized competitors do not allow generalization if male-male interactions are important. Second, I illustrate the necessity to analyze data on the logit scale rather than on raw proportions, because only the logit scale allows a clean separation of additive and nonadditive effects (i.e., male × male and female × male interactions). © 2012 The Author(s).

abstract={Models for the evolution of cannibalism highlight the importance of asymmetries between individuals in initiating cannibalistic attacks. Studies may include measures of body size but typically group individuals into size/age classes or compare populations. Such broad comparisons may obscure the details of interactions that ultimately determine how socially contingent characteristics evolve. We propose that understanding cannibalism is facilitated by using an interacting phenotypes perspective that includes the influences of the phenotype of a social partner on the behaviour of a focal individual and focuses on variation in individual pairwise interactions. We investigated how relative body size, a composite trait between a focal individual and its social partner, and the sex of the partners influenced precannibalistic aggression in the endangered Socorro isopod, Thermosphaeroma thermophilum. We also investigated whether differences in mating interest among males and females influenced cannibalism in mixed sex pairs. We studied these questions in three populations that differ markedly in range of body size and opportunities for interactions among individuals. We found that relative body size influences the probability of and latency to attack. We observed differences in the likelihood of and latency to attack based on both an individual's sex and the sex of its partner but found no evidence of sexual conflict. The instigation of precannibalistic aggression in these isopods is therefore a property of both an individual and its social partner. Our results suggest that interacting phenotype models would be improved by incorporating a new conditional ψ, which describes the strength of a social partner's influence on focal behaviour. © 2013 The Authors.

abstract={Cigarette smoking is the major environmental risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Genome-wide association studies have provided compelling associations for three loci with COPD. In this study, we aimed to estimate direct, i.e., independent from smoking, and indirect effects of those loci on COPD development using mediation analysis. We included a total of 3,424 COPD cases and 1,872 unaffected controls with data on two smoking-related phenotypes: lifetime average smoking intensity and cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke (pack years). Our analysis revealed that effects of two linked variants (rs1051730 and rs8034191) in the AGPHD1/CHRNA3 cluster on COPD development are significantly, yet not entirely, mediated by the smoking-related phenotypes. Approximately 30 % of the total effect of variants in the AGPHD1/CHRNA3 cluster on COPD development was mediated by pack years. Simultaneous analysis of modestly (r 2 = 0.21) linked markers in CHRNA3 and IREB2 revealed that an even larger (~42 %) proportion of the total effect of the CHRNA3 locus on COPD was mediated by pack years after adjustment for an IREB2 single nucleotide polymorphism. This study confirms the existence of direct effects of the AGPHD1/CHRNA3, IREB2, FAM13A and HHIP loci on COPD development. While the association of the AGPHD1/CHRNA3 locus with COPD is significantly mediated by smoking-related phenotypes, IREB2 appears to affect COPD independently of smoking. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Both the environments experienced by a mother as a juvenile and an adult can affect her investment in offspring. However, the implications of these maternal legacies, both juvenile and adult, for offspring fitness in natural populations are unclear. We investigated whether the juvenile growth rate and adult reproductive traits (length, body condition, and reproductive investment at spawning) of female wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were related to the growth and survival of their offspring. Adult salmon captured on their upstream migration were used to create experimental full-sib clutches of eggs, which were mixed and then placed in artificial nests in a natural stream that lacked salmon due to a migration barrier. Four months later we resampled the stream to obtain family-level estimates of offspring size and survival. Mothers that had grown slowly as juveniles (as determined by scalimetry) but had invested heavily in reproduction (egg production for a given body length) and were in relatively poor body condition (somatic mass for a given body length) at spawning produced the largest eggs. Larger eggs resulted in larger juveniles and higher juvenile survival. However, after controlling for egg size, offspring growth was positively related to maternal juvenile growth rate and reproductive investment. The predictors of offspring survival (i.e., reproductive success) varied with the juvenile growth rate of the mother: If females grew slowly as juveniles, their reproductive success was negatively related to their own body condition. In contrast, the reproductive success of females that grew quickly as juveniles was instead related positively to their own body condition. Our results show that maternal influences on offspring in the wild can be complex, with reproductive success related to the early life performance of the mother, as well as her state at the time of breeding. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Aboveground-belowground linkages are recognized as divers of community dynamics and ecosystem processes, but the impacts of plant-neighbor interactions on these linkages are virtually unknown. Plant-neighbor interactions are a type of interspecific indirect genetic effect (IIGE) if the focal plant's phenotype is altered by the expression of genes in a neighboring heterospecific plant, and IIGEs could persist after plant senescence to affect ecosystem processes. This perspective can provide insight into how plant-neighbor interactions affect evolution, as IIGEs are capable of altering species interactions and community composition over time. Utilizing genotypes of Solidago altissima and Solidago gigantea, we experimentally tested whether IIGEs that had affected living focal plants would affect litter decomposition rate, as well as nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) dynamics after the focal plant senesced. We found that species interactions affected N release and genotype interactions affected P immobilization. From a previous study we knew that neighbor genotype influenced patterns of biomass allocation for focal plants. Here we extend those previous results to show that these changes in biomass allocation altered litter quality, that then altered rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling. Our results provide insights into above- and belowground linkages by showing that, through their effects on plant litter quality (e.g., litter lignin:N), IIGEs can have afterlife effects, tying plant-neighbor interactions to ecosystem processes. This holistic approach advances our understanding of decomposition and nutrient cycling by showing that evolutionary processes (i.e., IIGEs) can influence ecosystem functioning after plant senescence. Because plant traits are determined by the combined effects of genetic and environmental influences, and because these traits are known to affect decomposition and nutrient cycling, we suggest that ecosystem processes can be described as gene-less products of genetic interactions among the species comprising ecological communities. © 2013 Genung et al.},

abstract={Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are heritable effects of individuals on trait values of their conspecifics. IGEs may substantially affect response to selection, but empirical studies on IGEs are sparse and their magnitude and correlation with direct genetic effects are largely unknown in plants. Here we used linear mixed models to estimate genetic (co)variances attributable to direct and indirect effects for growth and foliar disease damage in a large pedigreed population of Eucalyptus globulus. We found significant IGEs for growth and disease damage, which increased with age for growth. The correlation between direct and indirect genetic effects was highly negative for growth, but highly positive for disease damage, consistent with neighbour competition and infection, respectively. IGEs increased heritable variation by 71% for disease damage, but reduced heritable variation by 85% for growth, leaving nonsignificant heritable variation for later age growth. Thus, IGEs are likely to prevent response to selection in growth, despite a considerable ordinary heritability. IGEs change our perspective on the genetic architecture and potential response to selection. Depending on the correlation between direct and indirect genetic effects, IGEs may enhance or diminish the response to natural or artificial selection compared with that predicted from ordinary heritability. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Social interactions among animals raised in pens can affect their performance. In this study direct and competitive models were compared to investigate the influence of social genetic effects on variation of carcass weight (CW), carcass lean meat content (LM) and ham round shape (RS) in heavy pigs. Four sequential models including, in addition to sex and slaughter group fixed effects, the random effects of the social group, litter (full-sibs family), direct and social genetic effects of pigs were evaluated. Social group and litter effects accounted for about 4 and 3% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. When social genetic effects were added to model, a small social heritability was estimated for all traits (from 0.3 to 0.7% of the phenotypic variance). A negative correlation between direct and social effects was estimated for LM and RS, reducing the total heritable variance available for selection. Model comparison showed that the best fit was provided by the model including only direct additive genetic effects of pigs. So, this model seems still preferable for the genetic evaluation of the investigated traits.},

abstract={Available experimental evidence suggests that there are genetic differences in the abilities of trees to compete for resources, in addition to non-genetic differences due to micro-site variation. The use of indirect genetic effects within the framework of linear mixed model methodology has been proposed for estimating genetic parameters and responses to selection in the presence of genetic competition. In this context, an individual's total breeding value reflects the effects of its direct breeding value on its own phenotype and its competitive breeding value on the phenotype of its neighbours. The present study used simulated data to investigate the relevance of accounting for competitive effects at the genetic and non-genetic levels in terms of the estimation of (co)variance components and selection response. Different experimental designs that resulted in different genetic relatedness levels within a neighbourhood and survival were other key issues examined. Variances estimated for additive genetic and residual effects tended to be biased under models that ignored genetic competition. Models that fitted competition at the genetic level only also resulted in biased (co)variance estimates for direct additive, competitive additive and residual effects. The ability to detect the correct model was reduced when relatedness within a neighbourhood was very low and survival decreased. Selection responses changed considerably between selecting on breeding value estimates from a model ignoring genetic competition and total breeding estimates using the correct model. Our results suggest that considering a genetic basis to competitive ability will be important to optimise selection programmes for genetic improvement of tree species. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Genetic studies of social behaviour have currently received new impetus from models including indirect genetic effects (IGEs) of social partners. This study aimed at investigating the contribution of conspecifics in social dominance, considered as response of dyadic interaction that is, winning (dominant individual) or losing (subordinate). A genetic correlation of -1 is expected between the attitude to win and the attitude to loose, and because a population always accounts for half winners and half losers, the heritability of the dominant status should be close to zero. Specifically, social dominance was studied in Aosta Chestnut and Aosta Black Pied (Bos taurus) breeds, alpine rustic cattle famous for traditional tournaments where pairs of cows assess dominant status in bloodless fights. The outcomes of 25590 dyadic interactions performed by 8159 individuals in 11 years were analysed by applying a classical quantitative model and models including indirect effects. Data were analysed via Bayesian approach on a threshold trait. The assessment of variances revealed a genetic correlation of -0.976 between direct and indirect genetic components. The heritability measured on a liability scale was 0.122 for direct phenotype, but decreased to 0.014 when the total heritable variance (TBV) was considered. The trend of estimated breeding values showed that the total TBV was constant over the years, even though its direct component increased and the indirect part decreased. This result confirms the relevance of IGEs on social behaviour and the assumption that the mean individual social dominance cannot evolve within a population, due to the evolutionary constraints imposed by the 'social environment'. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract={Background: Through social interactions, individuals affect one another's phenotype. In such cases, an individual's phenotype is affected by the direct (genetic) effect of the individual itself and the indirect (genetic) effects of the group mates. Using data on individual phenotypes, direct and indirect genetic (co)variances can be estimated. Together, they compose the total genetic variance that determines a population's potential to respond to selection. However, it can be difficult or expensive to obtain individual phenotypes. Phenotypes on traits such as egg production and feed intake are, therefore, often collected on group level. In this study, we investigated whether direct, indirect and total genetic variances, and breeding values can be estimated from pooled data (pooled by group). In addition, we determined the optimal group composition, i.e. the optimal number of families represented in a group to minimise the standard error of the estimates. Methods. This study was performed in three steps. First, all research questions were answered by theoretical derivations. Second, a simulation study was conducted to investigate the estimation of variance components and optimal group composition. Third, individual and pooled survival records on 12 944 purebred laying hens were analysed to investigate the estimation of breeding values and response to selection. Results: Through theoretical derivations and simulations, we showed that the total genetic variance can be estimated from pooled data, but the underlying direct and indirect genetic (co)variances cannot. Moreover, we showed that the most accurate estimates are obtained when group members belong to the same family. Additional theoretical derivations and data analyses on survival records showed that the total genetic variance and breeding values can be estimated from pooled data. Moreover, the correlation between the estimated total breeding values obtained from individual and pooled data was surprisingly close to one. This indicates that, for survival in purebred laying hens, loss in response to selection will be small when using pooled instead of individual data. Conclusions: Using pooled data, the total genetic variance and breeding values can be estimated, but the underlying genetic components cannot. The most accurate estimates are obtained when group members belong to the same family. © 2013 Peeters et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

All direct and indirect genetic effects are significant in milk and milk days traits (P<0.05). Individual and maternal heterosis and recombination effect are not significant on fat yield and fat percent traits. The individual and recombination effect were negative effect on milk yield. The result suggested that the Holstein is a favourable breed for crossbreeding program in developing country as Iran. © Leibniz Institute for Farm Animal Biology, Dummerstorf, Germany.},

abstract={Pigs may affect each other's health, welfare and productivity through their behaviour. The effect of a pig on the growth rate of its pen mates is partly heritable and is referred to as its social genetic effect. Social genetic effects, also known as indirect genetic effects, have been found in a number of livestock breeds, in natural and laboratory populations, and in plant breeding and forestry, and have become an important research topic in recent years. In pigs, social genetic effects are hypothesized to be related to behaviour. The mechanism behind social genetic effects for growth, as well as the relationship between behaviours and growth itself, is largely unknown. To gain insight in the mechanism behind social genetic effects, we investigated the relationship between behaviours and growth rate in pigs. On a commercial pig farm, 398 finishing pigs in 50 pens (eight pigs/pen) were observed at 12 weeks of age using 2-min instantaneous scan sampling for 6. h during daytime. For 324 observed pigs, growth rate during the finishing period was known. The relationship between behaviours and growth rate during the finishing period was analysed with behaviour as explanatory variable in a mixed model. Results show that time spent giving behaviours, like oral manipulation, social nosing, aggression and belly nosing, was not related to own growth rate. Receiving behaviours, however, did relate to growth. Pigs that received more oral manipulation, observed as tail biting, ear biting and paw biting, grew less well (P<0.05). Growth rate was 43 (±17) g/d lower in pigs that received oral manipulation during more than 2% of the observations as compared to pigs that did not receive oral manipulation. Pigs that received social nosing, a gentle touch or sniff at any part of the body, had a higher growth rate (P<0.05): growth rate differed 29 (±17) g/d between pigs that received social nosing during more than 2% of observations as compared to not receiving social nosing at all. Receiving aggression and belly nosing, a forceful rubbing of the belly, did not influence growth rate. In conclusion, receiving oral manipulation and social nosing related to growth rate. This suggests that pigs selected for positive social genetic effects for growth may potentially show behavioural changes. Effects of selection for social genetic effects on behaviour and growth will be studied in future research. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Selection for improved host response to infectious disease offers a desirable alternative to chemical treatment but has proven difficult in practice, due to low heritability estimates of disease traits. Disease data from field studies is often binary, indicating whether an individual has become infected or not following exposure to an infectious disease. Numerous studies have shown that from this data one can infer genetic variation in individuals' underlying susceptibility. In a previous study, we showed that with an indirect genetic effect (IGE) model it is possible to capture some genetic variation in infectivity, if present, as well as in susceptibility. Infectivity is the propensity of transmitting infection upon contact with a susceptible individual. It is an important factor determining the severity of an epidemic. However, there are severe shortcomings with the Standard IGE models as they do not accommodate the dynamic nature of disease data. Here we adjust the Standard IGE model to (1) make expression of infectivity dependent on the individuals' disease status (Case Model) and (2) to include timing of infection (Case-ordered Model). The models are evaluated by comparing impact of selection, bias, and accuracy of each model using simulated binary disease data. These were generated for populations with known variation in susceptibility and infectivity thus allowing comparisons between estimated and true breeding values. Overall the Case Model provided better estimates for host genetic susceptibility and infectivity compared to the Standard Model in terms of bias, impact, and accuracy. Furthermore, these estimates were strongly influenced by epidemiological characteristics. However, surprisingly, the Case-Ordered model performed considerably worse than the Standard and the Case Models, pointing toward limitations in incorporating disease dynamics into conventional variance component estimation methodology and software used in animal breeding. © 2012 Lipschutz-Powell, Woolliams, Bijma, Pong-Wong, Bermingham and Doeschl-Wilson.},

abstract={This study examined the behavioral consequences of selecting pigs using a social genetic model for growth. Calculations enable each member of a group of pigs to be given a direct breeding value (DBV) and a social breeding value (SBV), which can be summarized into a total breeding value (TBV) for growth. Selection for growth TBV could affect animal behavior because social effects account for within-group interactions. Data were recorded from 96 groups of Yorkshire and Yorkshire × Landrace pigs in a nucleus herd. Each group contained 15 pigs fed ad libitum from 2 feeders; the space allowance was 0.85 m2/pig. Average daily gain was quantified from 35 to 100 kg of BW. Fighting and bullying activity at mixing (period 1), lying frequency 3 wk after mixing (period 2), and counts of skin lesions in periods 1 and 2 were recorded. The DBV for these traits were estimated with a classic animal model. We simulated different correlations between the direct genetic effect and the social genetic effect on growth rate (rDS), 2 components that respectively determine a pig's genetic capacity to grow and its genetic influence on growth of group mates: rDS was successively assumed to be 0 and ±0.12, ±0.20, ±0.29, and ±0.58. Finally, the correlations between DBV, SBV, and TBV for ADG, as well as the DBV for behavior and skin lesions, were calculated and tested for a level of significance at P &lt; 0.05. The gradient from negative to positive values of rDS refers to a progressive path running from genetic antagonism to genetic mutualism for growth. If rDS in the population truly ranged between -0.58 and -0.20, correlations for TBV for ADG with DBV for fighting and bullying progressively increased with rDS. Consequently, if rDS was low (between -0.12 and +0.12) or positive (&gt;+0.12), pigs with high TBV for ADG had higher DBV for bullying other pigs in the group and for fighting than pigs with lower TBV for ADG. Pigs with high TBV for ADG did not differ from other pigs in their DBV for lesions to the anterior part of the body, but they had a lower DBV for posterior lesions, whereas in period 2, they had higher DBV for posterior lesions and lower DBV for lying. Under genetic mutualism for growth and in housing conditions similar to those in the present study, selection for growth TBV would promote the rapid establishment of the dominance relationships, with more aggressive contests among group mates at mixing. Pigs would subsequently be more active but, judging by skin lesions, less willing to fight in a more stable social situation. © 2012 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Traditional quantitative genetics assumes that an individual's phenotype is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. For many animals, part of the environment is social and provided by parents and other interacting partners. When expression of genes in social partners affects trait expression in a focal individual, indirect genetic effects occur. In this study, we explore the effects of indirect genetic effects on the magnitude and range of phenotypic values in a focal individual in a multi-member model analyzing three possible classes of interactions between individuals. We show that social interactions may not only cause indirect genetic effects but can also modify direct genetic effects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both direct and indirect genetic effects substantially alter the range of phenotypic values, particularly when a focal trait can influence its own expression via interactions with traits in other individuals. We derive a function predicting the relative importance of direct versus indirect genetic effects. Our model reveals that both direct and indirect genetic effects can depend to a large extent on both group size and interaction strength, altering group mean phenotype and variance. This may lead to scenarios where between group variation is much higher than within group variation despite similar underlying genetic properties, potentially affecting the level of selection. Our analysis highlights key properties of indirect genetic effects with important consequences for trait evolution, the level of selection and potentially speciation. © 2012 Trubenová, Hager.},

abstract={Knowledge of how genetic effects arising from parental care influence the evolution of offspring traits comes almost exclusively from studies of maternal care. However, males provide care in some taxa, and often this care differs from females in quality or quantity. If variation in paternal care is genetically based then, like maternal care and maternal effects, paternal effects may have important consequences for the evolution of offspring traits via indirect genetic effects (IGEs). IGEs and direct-indirect genetic covariances associated with parental care can contribute substantially to total heritability and influence predictions about how traits respond to selection. It is unknown, however, if the magnitude and sign of parental effects arising from fathers are the same as those arising from mothers. We used a reciprocal cross-fostering experiment to quantify environmental and genetic effects of paternal care on offspring performance in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides. We found that IGEs were substantial and direct-indirect genetic covariances were negative. Combined, these patterns led to low total heritabilities for offspring performance traits. Thus, under paternal care, offspring performance traits are unlikely to evolve in response to selection, and variation in these traits will be maintained in the population despite potentially strong selection on these traits. These patterns are similar to those generated by maternal care, indicating that the genetic effects of care on offspring performance are independent of the caregiver's sex. © 2012 The Author(s).

abstract={Through social interactions, individuals can affect one another's phenotype. The heritable effect of an individual on the phenotype of a conspecific is known as an indirect genetic effect (IGE). Although IGEs can have a substantial impact on heritable variation and response to selection, little is known about the genetic architecture of traits affected by IGEs. We studied IGEs for survival in domestic chickens (Gallus gallus), using data on two purebred lines and their reciprocal cross. Birds were kept in groups of four. Feather pecking and cannibalism caused mortality, as beaks were kept intact. Survival time was shorter in crossbreds than in purebreds, indicating outbreeding depression and the presence of nonadditive genetic effects. IGEs contributed the majority of heritable variation in crossbreds (87 and 72%) and around half of heritable variation in purebreds (65 and 44%). There was no evidence of dominance variance, neither direct nor indirect. Absence of dominance variance in combination with considerable outbreeding depression suggests that survival is affected by many loci. Direct-indirect genetic correlations were moderately to highly negative in crossbreds (-20.37 ± 0.17 and -0.83 ± 0.10), but low and not significantly different from zero in purebreds (0.20 ± 0.21 and -20.28 ± 0.18). Consequently, unlike purebreds, crossbreds would fail to respond positively to mass selection. The direct genetic correlation between both crosses was high (0.95 ± 0.23), whereas the indirect genetic correlation was moderate (0.41 ± 0.26). Thus, for IGEs, it mattered which parental line provided the sire and which provided the dam. This indirect parent-of-origin effect appeared to be paternally transmitted and is probably Z chromosome linked. © 2012 by the Genetics Society of America.},

This has proven to be a challenging and controversial proposition. However, several recent modelling frameworks provide insight: indirect genetic effect (IGE) models, niche construction models, and evolutionary feedback models. These distinct approaches converge upon the observation that gene action at a distance generates feedback that expands the range of trait values and evolutionary rates that we should expect to observe in empirical studies. Such conceptual replication provides solid evidence that traits with extended effects have important evolutionary consequences, but more empirical work is needed to evaluate the predictive power of different modelling approaches. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Female mating preferences are often flexible, reflecting the social environment in which they are expressed. Associated indirect genetic effects (IGEs) can affect the rate and direction of evolutionary change, but sexual selection models do not capture these dynamics. We incorporate IGEs into quantitative genetic models to explore how variation in social environments and mate choice flexibility influence Fisherian sexual selection. The importance of IGEs is that runaway sexual selection can occur in the absence of a genetic correlation between male traits and female preferences. Social influences can facilitate the initiation of the runaway process and increase the rate of trait elaboration. Incorporating costs to choice do not alter the main findings. Our model provides testable predictions: (1) genetic covariances between male traits and female preferences may not exist, (2) social flexibility in female choice will be common in populations experiencing strong sexual selection, (3) variation in social environments should be associated with rapid sexual trait divergence, and (4) secondary sexual traits will be more elaborate than previously predicted. Allowing feedback from the social environment resolves discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical data, such as why indirect selection on female preferences, theoretically weak, might be sufficient for preferences to become elaborated. © 2012 The Author(s).

abstract={Aosta Black Pied (ABP) and Aosta Chestnut (AC) are dual-purpose cattle indigenous to the western Alps and famous for their fighting ability in traditional Italian Batailles de Reines. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of inbreeding on breeding values for fighting ability achieved in participants. Inbreeding (F) and average relatedness (AR) were obtained from the entire pedigree information available (19,554 and 87,967 records for ABP and AC, respectively). Data (n = 23,998) relating to 8,259 cows competing in years 2001-2009 were analyzed to obtain heritability (h2) estimates and breeding values for the trait. A placement score was chosen as a phenotype for fighting ability and both a classical quantitative model (NORM) and its implementation, used to identify its indirect genetic effects (COMP), were analyzed using the expectation maximization-REML (EM-REML) method. The F and AR trends in animals born between 1990 and 2009 were generally low and were greater for ABP (+0.06%/yr) than for AC (+0.03%/yr) populations, which also presented a greater mean F (about 2.8% ± 1.7% vs. 0.8% ± 1.5% for ABP and AC, respectively) and mean AR among individuals (about 1.0% ± 0.8% vs. 0.4% ± 0.3% for ABP and AC, respectively). Heritability estimates from 0.083 ± 0.036 to 0.120 ± 0.037 were obtained using the NORM model, accounting for or not accounting for F, respectively. Similar results were obtained also for the COMP model, with h2 estimates of 0.12 ± 0.037, whether or not F was taken into consideration. Linear regression analyses carried out on the 33 major lineages to which most of participants belonged (n = 6,087) revealed an overall negative trend of EBV compared with the increase of either F (b = - 21.3, P &lt; 0.01) or AR (b = -50.1, P &lt; 0.01). However, a great variability in the relationship between EBV and F or AR was found by analyzing data within lineages. Despite the variability, an unfavorable effect of inbreeding was detected in the fighting ability trait of both ABP and AC cattle, and this should be carefully considered in the breeding management of both breeds. © 2012 American Society of Animal Science.

abstract={Maternal care has been suggested to evolve more readily in haplodiploid populations. Because maternal care appears to have been a prerequisite for the evolution of eusociality, this effect potentially explains the apparent preponderance of haplodiploidy among eusocial taxa. Here, I use a kin selection approach to model the evolution of maternal care in diploid and haplodiploid populations. In contrast to previous suggestions, I find that haplodiploidy may inhibit as well as promote the evolution of maternal care. Moreover, I find that the haplodiploidy effect vanishes in outbred populations if gene effects average rather than add together. I confirm these analytical results using numerical simulation of an explicit population genetics model. This analysis casts doubt upon the idea that haplodiploidy has promoted the evolution of maternal care and, consequently, the evolution of eusociality. © 2012 The Author.

abstract={In the pig industry, male piglets are surgically castrated early in life to prevent boar taint. Boar taint is mainly caused by androstenone and skatole. Androstenone is a pheromone that can be released from the salivary glands when the boar is sexually aroused. Boars are housed in groups and as a consequence boars can influence and be influenced by the phenotype of other boars by (non-)heritable social interactions. The influence of these social interactions on androstenone is not well understood. The objective of this study is to investigate whether androstenone concentrations are affected by (non-)heritable social interactions and estimate their genetic correlation with growth rate and backfat. The dataset contained 6,245 boars, of which 4,455 had androstenone observations (68%). The average number of animals per pen was 7 and boars were housed in 899 unique pen-groups (boars within a single pen) and 344 unique compartment- groups (boars within a unique 'room' within a barn during time). Four models including different random effects, were compared for androstenone. Direct genetic, associative (also known as social genetic or indirect genetic effects), group, compartment, common environment and residual effects were included as random effects in the full model (M3). Including random pen and compartment effects (non-heritable social effects) significantly improved the model (M2) compared with including only direct, common environment and residual as random effects (M1, P < 0.001), and including associative effects even more (M3, P < 0.001). The sum of the direct and associative variance components determines the total genetic variance of the trait. The associative effect explained 11.7% of the total genetic variance. Backfat thickness was analysed using M2 and growth using M3. The genetic correlation between backfat (direct genetic variance) and total genetic variance for androstenone was close to 0. Backfat and the direct and associative effects for androstenone had genetic correlations of 0.14 ± 0.08 and -0.25 ± 0.18, respectively. The genetic correlation between total genetic variances for growth rate and androstenone was 0.33 ± 0.18. The genetic correlation between direct effects was 0.11 ± 0.09 and between associative effects was 0.42 ± 0.31. The genetic correlations and current selection towards lower backfat and greater growth rate suggest that no major change in androstenone is expected when breeding goals are not changed. For selection against boar taint and therefore also against androstenone, results recommend that at least the social environment of the boars should be considered. © 2012American Society of Animal Science.

abstract={In many traits involved in social interactions, such as courtship and aggression, the phenotype is an outcome of interactions between individuals. Such traits whose expression in an individual is partly determined by the phenotype of its social partner are called "interacting phenotypes." Quantitative genetic models suggested that interacting phenotypes can evolve much faster than nonsocial traits. Current models, however, consider the interaction between phenotypes of social partners as a fixed phenotypic response rule, represented by an interaction coefficient (ψ). Here, we extend existing theoretical models and incorporate the interaction coefficient as a trait that can evolve. We find that the evolution of the interaction coefficient can change qualitatively the predictions about the rate and direction of evolution of interacting phenotypes. We argue that it is crucial to determine whether and how the phenotypic response of an individual to its social partner can evolve to make accurate predictions about the evolution of traits involved in social interactions. © 2012 The Author(s).

abstract={Reducing disease prevalence through selection for host resistance offers a desirable alternative to chemical treatment. Selection for host resistance has proven difficult, however, due to low heritability estimates. These low estimates may be caused by a failure to capture all the relevant genetic variance in disease resistance, as genetic analysis currently is not taylored to estimate genetic variation in infectivity. Host infectivity is the propensity of transmitting infection upon contact with a susceptible individual, and can be regarded as an indirect effect to disease status. It may be caused by a combination of physiological and behavioural traits. Though genetic variation in infectivity is difficult to measure directly, Indirect Genetic Effect (IGE) models, also referred to as associative effects or social interaction models, allow the estimation of this variance from more readily available binary disease data (infected/non-infected). We therefore generated binary disease data from simulated populations with known amounts of variation in susceptibility and infectivity to test the adequacy of traditional and IGE models. Our results show that a conventional model fails to capture the genetic variation in infectivity inherent in populations with simulated infectivity. An IGE model, on the other hand, does capture some of the variation in infectivity. Comparison with expected genetic variance suggests that there is scope for further methodological improvement, and that potential responses to selection may be greater than values presented here. Nonetheless, selection using an index of estimated direct and indirect breeding values was shown to have a greater genetic selection differential and reduced future disease risk than traditional selection for resistance only. These findings suggest that if genetic variation in infectivity substantially contributes to disease transmission, then breeding designs which explicitly incorporate IGEs might help reduce disease prevalence. © 2012 Lipschutz-Powell et al.},

Sinks had lower habitat quality and had a greater incidence of adults than sources, which consisted mostly of juveniles. 5.Rivers invaded by salmonid escapees experienced significantly higher aquaculture pressure than rivers where salmonid escapees were apparently absent, but no effect on genetic diversity of G. maculatus could be detected. 6.We discuss whether salmonid aquaculture might affect the demography and connectivity of galaxiid metapopulations: indirectly through habitat alteration and directly through escapes of predatory fish. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The relationships among the members of a population can be visualized using individual networks, where each individual is a node connected to each other by means of links describing the interactions. The centrality of a given node captures its importance within the network. We hypothesize that in mutualistic networks, the centrality of a node should benefit its fitness. We test this idea studying eight individualbased networks originated from the interaction between Erysimum mediohispanicum and its flower visitors. In these networks, each plant was considered a node and was connected to conspecifics sharing flower visitors. Centrality indicates how well connected is a given E. mediohispanicum individual with the rest of the co-occurring conspecifics because of sharing flower visitors. The centrality was estimated by three network metrics: betweenness, closeness and degree. The complex relationship between centrality, phenotype and fitness was explored by structural equation modelling. We found that the centrality of a plant was related to its fitness, with plants occupying central positions having higher fitness than those occupying peripheral positions. The structural equation models (SEMs) indicated that the centrality effect on fitness was not merely an effect of the abundance of visits and the species richness of visitors. Centrality has an effect even when simultaneously accounting for these predictors. The SEMs also indicated that the centrality effect on fitness was because of the specific phenotype of each plant, with attractive plants occupying central positions in networks, in relation to the distribution of conspecific phenotypes. This finding suggests that centrality, owing to its dependence on social interactions, may be an appropriate surrogate for the interacting phenotype of individuals. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Social interactions have a powerful effect on the evolutionary process. Recent attempts to synthesize models of social selection with equations for indirect genetic effects (McGlothlin et al. 2010) provide a broad theoretical base from which to study selection and evolutionary response in the context of social interactions. However, this framework concludes that social selection will lead to evolution only if the traits carried by social partners are nonrandomly associated. I suggest this conclusion is incomplete, and that traits that do not covary between social partners can nevertheless lead to evolution via interactive effects on fitness. Such effects occur when there are functional interactions between traits, and as an example I use the interplay in water striders (Gerridae) between grasping appendages carried by males and spines by females. Functional interactive effects between traits can be incorporated into both the equations for social selection and the general model of social evolution proposed by McGlothlin et al. These expanded equations would accommodate adaptive coevolution in social interactions, integrate the quantitative genetic approach to social evolution with game theoretical approaches, and stimulate some new questions about the process of social evolution. © 2011 The Author.

abstract={Division of labor in social insects has made the evolution of collective traits possible that cannot be achieved by individuals alone. Differences in behavioral responses produce variation in engagement in behavioral tasks, which as a consequence, generates a division of labor. We still have little understanding of the genetic components influencing these behaviors, although several candidate genomic regions and genes influencing individual behavior have been identified. Here, we report that mixing of worker honeybees with different genotypes influences the expression of individual worker behaviors and the transcription of genes in the neuronal substrate. These indirect genetic effects arise in a colony because numerous interactions between workers produce interacting phenotypes and genotypes across organisms. We studied hygienic behavior of honeybee workers, which involves the cleaning of diseased brood cells in the colony. We mixed ~500 newly emerged honeybee workers with genotypes of preferred Low (L) and High (H) hygienic behaviors. The L/H genotypic mixing affected the behavioral engagement of L worker bees in a hygienic task, the cooperation among workers in uncapping single brood cells, and switching between hygienic tasks. We found no evidence that recruiting and task-related stimuli are the primary source of the indirect genetic effects on behavior. We suggested that behavioral responsiveness of L bees was affected by genotypic mixing and found evidence for changes in the brain in terms of 943 differently expressed genes. The functional categories of cell adhesion, cellular component organization, anatomical structure development, protein localization, developmental growth and cell morphogenesis were overrepresented in this set of 943 genes, suggesting that indirect genetic effects can play a role in modulating and modifying the neuronal substrate. Our results suggest that genotypes of social partners affect the behavioral responsiveness and the neuronal substrate of individual workers, indicating a complex genetic architecture underlying the expression of behavior. © 2012 Gempe et al.},

abstract={Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one individual affect the phenotype of a conspecific. Theoretical models indicate that the evolutionary consequences of IGEs critically depend on the genetic architecture of interacting traits, and on the strength and direction of phenotypic effects arising from social interactions, which can be quantified by the interaction coefficient ψ. In the context of sexually selected traits, strong positive ψ tends to exaggerate evolutionary change, whereas negative ψ impedes sexual trait elaboration. Despite its theoretical importance, whether and how ψ varies among geographically distinct populations is unknown. Such information is necessary to evaluate the potential for IGEs to contribute to divergence among isolated or semi-isolated populations. Here, we report substantial variation in ψ for a behavioural trait involved in sexual selection in the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus: female choosiness. Both the strength and direction of ψ varied among geographically isolated populations. ψ also changed over time. In a contemporary population of crickets from Kauai, experience of male song increased female choosiness. In contrast, experience of male song decreased choosiness in an ancestral population from the same location. This rapid change corroborates studies examining the evolvability of ψ and demonstrates how interpopulation variation in the interaction coefficient might influence sexual selection and accelerate divergence of traits influenced by IGEs that contribute to reproductive isolation in nascent species or subspecies. © 2012 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The analysis of the causes of selection is in essence a problem in ecology. Wade and Kalisz 1990Past evolution determines the genetically determined available phenotypes in populations which affect ecological dynamics in communities, shaping in turn the selective pressures that further model phenotypes. Because an increase in temperature increases metabolic rates and encounter rates, climate change may have profound eco-evolutionary effects, possibly affecting the future persistence and functioning of food webs. We introduce a semi-spatially explicit individual-based model (IBM) framework to study functional eco-evolutionary dynamics in food webs. Each species embedded in the web includes 13 genetically determined and multidimensionally variable traits (the G matrix), 4 of which are flexible physiological and behavioural (personality) traits that respond to temperature. An increase in temperature and stronger correlation among traits leads to stronger trophic cascades but higher stochasticity, with higher probability of extinction for some trophic levels. A combination of the abiotic (temperature) and biotic (predators' presence/absence) matrix of selective agents (the O matrix) generates differential selection for activation energies for metabolic rates and several instances of correlational selection (selection in one trait changes with the levels of another), suggesting how global warming might favour certain trait combinations. Our results and the future prospects of this IBM approach open new avenues for climate change research. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Polyphenic traits are widespread, but compared to other traits, relatively few studies have explored the mechanisms that influence their inheritance. Here we investigated the relative importance of additive, nonadditive genetic, and parental sources of variation in the expression of polyphenic male dimorphism in the mite Rhizoglyphus echinopus, a species in which males are either fighters or scramblers. We established eight inbred lines through eight generations of full-sibling matings, and then crossed the inbred lines in a partial diallel design. Nymphs were isolated and raised to adulthood with ad libitum food. At adulthood, male morph was recorded for all male offspring. Using a Cockerham-Weir model, we found strong paternal effects for this polyphenic trait that could be either linked to the Y chromosome of males or an indirect genetic effect that is environmentally transmitted. In additional analyses, we were able to corroborate the paternal effects but also detected significant additive effects questioning the Cockerham-Weir analysis. This study reveals the potential importance of paternal effects on the expression of polyphenic traits and sheds light on the complex genetic architecture of these traits. © 2012 The Author(s).

abstract={Genetic selection is a major force shaping life on earth. In classical genetic theory, response to selection is the product of the strength of selection and the additive genetic variance in a trait. The additive genetic variance reflects a population's intrinsic potential to respond to selection. The ordinary additive genetic variance, however, ignores the social organization of life. With social interactions among individuals, individual trait values may depend on genes in others, a phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects. Models accounting for indirect genetic effects, however, lack a general definition of heritable variation. Here I propose a general definition of the heritable variation that determines the potential of a population to respond to selection. This generalizes the concept of heritable variance to any inheritance model and level of organization. The result shows that heritable variance determining potential response to selection is the variance among individuals in the heritable quantity that determines the population mean trait value, rather than the usual additive genetic component of phenotypic variance. It follows, therefore, that heritable variance may exceed phenotypic variance among individuals, which is impossible in classical theory. This work also provides a measure of the utilization of heritable variation for response to selection and integrates two well-known models of maternal genetic effects. The result shows that relatedness between the focal individual and the individuals affecting its fitness is a key determinant of the utilization of heritable variance for response to selection.},

abstract={Social interactions often have major fitness consequences, but little is known about how specific interacting phenotypes affect the strength of natural selection. Social influences on the evolutionary process can be assessed using a multilevel selection approach that partitions the effects of social partner phenotypes on fitness (referred to as social or group selection) from those of the traits of a focal individual (nonsocial or individual selection). To quantify the contribution of social selection to total selection affecting a trait, the patterns of phenotypic association among interactants must also be considered. We estimated selection gradients on male body size in a wild population of forked fungus beetles (Bolitotherus cornutus). We detected positive nonsocial selection and negative social selection on body size operating through differences in copulation success, indicating that large males with small social partners had highest fitness. In addition, we found that, in low-density demes, the phenotypes of focal individuals were negatively correlated with those of their social partners. This pattern reversed the negative effect of group selection on body size and led to stronger positive selection for body size. Our results demonstrate multilevel selection in nature and stress the importance of considering social selection whenever conspecific interactions occur nonrandomly. © 2011 The Author(s).

abstract={Social evolution in honey bees has produced strong queen-worker dimorphism for plastic traits that depend on larval nutrition. The honey bee developmental programme includes both larval components that determine plastic growth responses to larval nutrition and nurse components that regulate larval nutrition. We studied how these two components contribute to variation in worker and queen body size and ovary size for two pairs of honey bee lineages that show similar differences in worker body-ovary size allometry but have diverged over different evolutionary timescales. Our results indicate that the lineages have diverged for both nurse and larval developmental components, that rapid changes in worker body-ovary size allometry may disrupt queen development and that queen-worker dimorphism arises mainly from discrete nurse-provided nutritional environments, not from a developmental switch that converts variable nutritional environments into discrete phenotypes. Both larval and nurse components have likely contributed to the evolution of queen-worker dimorphism. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Reproductive effort, egg number and egg size are traditionally considered to be 'female' life history traits. However, females often adjust the amount of resources allocated to reproduction depending on their mate, causing male environmental effects on life history traits. If females respond to male traits which are genetically variable, then male environmental effects contain indirect genetic effects. Estimates of how much of the total variation in life history traits originates from female effects versus male environmental effects, seems mostly lacking. We have investigated variation in rates of egg production and in egg size in the annual Argentinian blackfin pearl killifish Austrolebias nigripinnis, in a crossed design where males were exchanged repeatedly between females. Our analysis of phenotypic variance components of reproductive effort, egg size and egg number indicates that the amount of variation contributed by male environmental effects is equal (egg size, reproductive effort) or larger (egg number) than that between females. For egg size and number, we find that male environmental effects consist of a male random effect representing the average response of females to male phenotype, plus a female-male interaction term. This term can be understood as the deviation from the population mean of an individual female's response. For reproductive effort, we find that the male environmental effect consists of an interaction term only. Random effects on egg size and number additionally vary in magnitude depending on the weekday where we collected eggs, probably due to cyclic variation in experimental conditions. Since we find that both male phenotype and environmental conditions affect egg size and number as determined by females, our results suggest that selection on these life history traits will be frequency-dependent. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={Inheritance-the influence of ancestors on the phenotypes of their descendants-translates natural selection into evolutionary change. For the past century, inheritance has been conceptualized almost exclusively as the transmission of DNA sequence variation from parents to offspring in accordance with Mendelian rules, but advances in cell and developmental biology have now revealed a rich array of inheritance mechanisms. This empirical evidence calls for a unified conception of inheritance that combines genetic and nongenetic mechanisms and encompasses the known range of transgenerational effects, including the transmission of genetic and epigenetic variation, the transmission of plastic phenotypes (acquired traits), and the effects of parental environment and genotype on offspring phenotype. We propose a unified theoretical framework based on the Price equation that can be used to model evolution under an expanded inheritance concept that combines the effects of genetic and nongenetic inheritance. To illustrate the utility and generality of this framework, we show how it can be applied to a variety of scenarios, including nontransmissible environmental noise, maternal effects, indirect genetic effects, transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, RNA-mediated inheritance, and cultural inheritance. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Social interactions among individuals are commonly observed in both plants and animals, and may be partly genetically determined. The social effect of an individual does not affect the phenotype of the individual itself, but rather the phenotypes of all other individuals sharing the environment. As an alternative to traditional breeding schemes solely focusing on the direct breeding value affecting the phenotype of the individual itself, selection may be focused on total breeding values, including both direct and social effects. The latter may give a substantial increase in the rate of genetic gain of the population, given existence of significant social genetic effects. However, social effects are only identifiable when individuals are allocated in several groups. Previously, it has been suggested that an optimum design should include many small groups consisting of unrelated individuals, e.g., by randomly allocating individuals to each group (RAN). However, we hypothesize that a design with few (three) families per group (3FAM), and where each family is tested repeatedly in three different groups would be more advantageous. Using stochastic simulations, assuming a full-sib data structure typical for aquaculture breeding schemes, we compared the two designs with respect to accuracy of breeding values and their ability to produce accurate estimates of (co)variance components of direct and social effects. The results showed that the 3FAM design was clearly superior with respect to precision of estimated genetic (co)variance components of social effects and had substantially higher accuracy of both social and total breeding values, compared with the RAN design (16 to 105% increase). The advantage was particularly expressed at scenarios with zero or negative genetic correlation between direct and social genetic effects. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In many animal species, embryos are exposed to maternal hormones that affect their development. Maternal hormone transfer varies with environmental conditions of the mother and is often interpreted as being shaped by natural selection to adjust the offspring to prevailing environmental conditions. Such hormone transfer requires genetic variability, which has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. Our study reports direct evidence for additive genetic variance of maternal androgens through a bidirectional selection on yolk testosterone (T) levels in Japanese quail. Lines selected for high egg T (HET) and low egg T (LET) concentration differed in yolk levels of this androgen, resulting in high realized heritability (h2p 0.42). Correlated responses to selection on other gonadal hormones indicated that selection specifically targeted biologically active androgens. Eggs of HET quail contained higher androstenedione and lower estradiol concentrations than did those of LET quail, with no line differences in yolk progesterone concentration. Plasma T concentrations in adult females were not affected by selection, seriously challenging the hypothesis that transfer of maternal hormones to offspring is constrained by hormone levels in a mother's circulation. Our results suggest that transfer of maternal T represents an indirect genetic effect that has important consequences for the evolution of traits in offspring. © 2011 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Several experimental results support the existence of costs associated with exaggerated begging behaviour, which are assumed by some theoretical models of honest signalling in parent-offspring communication. However, to understand how honest begging behaviour is evolutionarily maintained in nature, the long-term cost-benefit output associated with exaggerated signals should also be estimated. As far as we know, the net cost-benefit balance of begging display has not previously been explored. Here, we used an appetite stimulant, cyproheptadine hydrochloride, to increase the feeling of hunger in some magpie nestlings. Supporting the use of cyproheptadine to manipulate hunger level and thereby begging behaviour, we found that experimental nestlings increased the frequency of begging and received more food than their control nestmates. Contrary to the expectation that physiological costs per se counteract the associated benefits of escalated begging signals, we found that near-fledging experimental magpies showed a better physical condition than control nestlings. These findings stress the interesting question of why magpie nestlings do not show to adults an escalated level of hunger if it implies an advantage. We discuss the responsibility of inclusive fitness costs and indirect genetic effects for the maintenance of honesty in parent-offspring communication. © 2011.

abstract={A major evolutionary question is how reproductive sharing arises in cooperatively breeding species despite the inherent reproductive conflicts in social groups. Reproductive skew theory offers one potential solution: each group member gains or is allotted inclusive fitness equal to or exceeding their expectation from reproducing on their own. Unfortunately, a multitude of skew models with conflicting predictions has led to confusion in both testing and evaluating skew theory. The confusion arises partly because one set of models (the 'transactional' type) answer the ultimate evolutionary question of what ranges of reproductive skew can yield fitness-enhancing solutions for all group members. The second set of models ('compromise') give an evolutionarily proximate, game-theoretic evolutionarily stable state (ESS) solution that determines reproductive shares based on relative competitive abilities. However, several predictions arising from compromise models require a linear payoff to increased competition and do not hold with non-linear payoffs. Given that for most species it may be very difficult or impossible to determine the true relationship between effort devoted to competition and reproductive share gained, compromise models are much less predictive than previously appreciated. Almost all skew models make one quantitative prediction (e.g. realized skew must fall within ranges predicted by transactional models), and two qualitative predictions (e.g. variation in relatedness or competitive ability across groups affects skew). A thorough review of the data finds that these three predictions are relatively rarely supported. As a general rule, therefore, the evolution of cooperative breeding appears not to be dependent on the ability of group members to monitor relatedness or competitive ability in order to adjust their behaviour dynamically to gain reproductive share. Although reproductive skew theory fails to predict within-group dynamics consistently, it does better at predicting quantitative differences in skew across populations or species. This suggests that kin selection can play a significant role in the evolution of sociality. To advance our understanding of reproductive skew will require focusing on a broader array of factors, such as the frequency of mistaken identity, delayed fitness payoffs, and selection pressures arising from across-group competition. We furthermore suggest a novel approach to investigate the sharing of reproduction that focuses on the underlying genetics of skew. A quantitative genetics approach allows the partitioning of variance in reproductive share itself or that of traits closely associated with skew into genetic and non-genetic sources. Thus, we can determine the heritability of reproductive share and infer whether it actually is the focus of natural selection. We view the 'animal model' as the most promising empirical method where the genetics of reproductive share can be directly analyzed in wild populations. In the quest to assess whether skew theory can provide a framework for understanding the evolution of sociality, quantitative genetics will be a central tool in future research. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Theoretical and empirical studies have sought to explain the formation and maintenance of social relationships within groups. The resulting dominance hierarchies have significant fitness and survival consequences dependent upon social status. We hypothesised that each position or rank within a group has a distinctive brain gene expression profile that correlates with behavioural phenotype. Furthermore, transitions in rank position should determine which genes shift in expression concurrent with the new dominance status. We used a custom cDNA microarray to profile brain transcript expression in a model species, the rainbow trout, which forms tractable linear hierarchies. Dominant, subdominant and submissive individuals had distinctive transcript profiles with 110 gene probes identified using conservative statistical analyses. By removing the dominant, we characterised the changes in transcript expression in sub-dominant individuals that became dominant demonstrating that the molecular transition occurred within 48 hours. A strong, novel candidate gene, ependymin, which was highly expressed in both the transcript and protein in subdominants relative to dominants, was tested further. Using antibody injection to inactivate ependymin in pairs of dominant and subdominant zebrafish, the subdominant fish exhibited a substantial increase in aggression in parallel with an enhanced competitive ability. This is the first study to characterise the molecular signatures of dominance status within groups and the first to implicate ependymin in control of aggressive behaviour. It also provides evidence for indirect genetic effect models in which genotype/phenotype of an individual is influenced by conspecific interactions within a group. The variation in the molecular profile of each individual within a group may offer a new explanation of intraspecific variation in gene expression within undefined groups of animals and provides new candidates for empirical study. © 2011 Sneddon et al.},

abstract={By determining access to limited resources, social dominance is often an important determinant of fitness. Thus, if heritable, standard theory predicts mean dominance should evolve. However, dominance is usually inferred from the tendency to win contests, and given one winner and one loser in any dyadic contest, the mean proportion won will always equal 0.5. Here, we argue that the apparent conflict between quantitative genetic theory and common sense is resolved by recognition of indirect genetic effects (IGEs). We estimate selection on, and genetic (co)variance structures for, social dominance, in a wild population of red deer Cervus elaphus, on the Scottish island of Rum. While dominance is heritable and positively correlated with lifetime fitness, contest outcomes depend as much on the genes carried by an opponent as on the genotype of a focal individual. We show how this dependency imposes an absolute evolutionary constraint on the phenotypic mean, thus reconciling theoretical predictions with common sense. More generally, we argue that IGEs likely provide a widespread but poorly recognized source of evolutionary constraint for traits influenced by competition. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={1. There is relatively little information on how evolutionary processes that alter genetic variation in a focal species may affect interactions with other species, impact the structure or function of the community and ecosystem, and affect evolutionary feedbacks among interacting species through time. 2.Because evolution can occur at ecological time-scales, it is important to understand how major selective events, such as climatic changes, can impact the community of interacting species and ecosystem processes by changing intraspecific genetic variation. 3.The evidence linking genetic variation and evolution to community change and feedbacks has arisen from several different approaches whose results have not been synthesized into one conceptual framework, and whose commonalities may not be fully understood. 4.This review synthesizes several different experimental approaches on how evolution may impact communities and ecosystems and focuses on five main issues: (i) the genetic basis to communities and ecosystems; (ii) the community and ecosystem consequences of among-population genetic differentiation; (iii) the role of local adaptation and co-evolution; (iv) the effects of trans-generational feedbacks and the eco-evo dynamic and; (v) the integration of community and ecosystem genetics and multi-level selection. 5.Evolution can alter intraspecific genetic variation to affect indirect genetic effects and feedbacks. Future studies should investigate how communities and ecosystems are affected when evolution causes the strength of feedbacks to change. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={It is well known that humans tend to associate with other humans who have similar characteristics, but it is unclear whether this tendency has consequences for the distribution of genotypes in a population. Although geneticists have shown that populations tend to stratify genetically, this process results from geographic sorting or assortative mating, and it is unknown whether genotypes may be correlated as a consequence of nonreproductive associations or other processes. Here, we study six available genotypes from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to test for genetic similarity between friends. Maps of the friendship networks show clustering of genotypes and, after we apply strict controls for population stratification, the results show that one genotype is positively correlated (homophily) and one genotype is negatively correlated (heterophily). A replication study in an independent sample from the Framingham Heart Study verifies that DRD2 exhibits significant homophily and that CYP2A6 exhibits significant heterophily. These unique results show that homophily and heterophily obtain on a genetic (indeed, an allelic) level, which has implications for the study of population genetics and social behavior. In particular, the results suggest that association tests should include friends' genes and that theories of evolution should take into account the fact that humans might, in some sense, be metagenomic with respect to the humans around them.},

abstract={Recent evidence indicates that grassland community structure and species diversity are influenced by genetic variation within species. We review what is known regarding the impact of intraspecific diversity on grassland community structure, using an ancient limestone pasture as a focal example. Two genotype-dependent effects appear to modify community structure in this system. First, the abundance of individual constituent species can depend upon the combined influence of direct genetic effects stemming from individuals within the population. Second, the outcome of localized interspecific interactions occurring within the community can depend on the genotypes of participating individuals (indicating indirect genetic effects). Only genotypic interactions are thought to be capable of allowing the long-term coexistence of both genotypes and species. We discuss the implications of these effects for the maintenance of diversity in grasslands. Next, we present new observations indicating that losses of genotypic diversity from each of two species can be predicted by the abundance of other coexisting species within experimental grassland communities. These results suggest genotypespecific responses to abundance in other coexisting species. We conclude that both direct and indirect genetic effects are likely to shape community structure and species coexistence in grasslands, implying tight linkage between fine-scale genetic and community structure. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={A metacommunity can be defined as a set of communities that are linked by migration, and extinction and recolonization. In metacommunities, evolution can occur not only by processes that occur within communities such as drift and individual selection, but also by among-community processes, such as divergent selection owing to random differences among communities in species composition, and group and community-level selection. The effect of these among-community-level processes depends on the pattern of migration among communities. Migrating units may be individuals (migrant pool model), groups of individuals (single-species propagule pool model) or multi-species associations (multi-species propagule pool model). The most interesting case is the multi-species propagule pool model. Although this pattern of migration may a priori seem rare, it becomes more plausible in small well-defined 'communities' such as symbiotic associations between two or a few species. Theoretical models and experimental studies show that community selection is potentially an effective evolutionary force. Such evolution can occur either through genetic changes within species or through changes in the species composition of the communities. Although laboratory studies show that community selection can be important, little is known about how important it is in natural populations. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={In this review, I consider the contribution that common evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) has made towards integrating the ecology, evolution and genetics of species interactions. Oenothera biennis was among the earliest plant models in genetics and cytogenetics and it played an important role in the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology. More recently, population and ecological genetics approaches have provided insight into the patterns of genetic variation within and between populations, and how a combination of abiotic and biotic factors maintain and select on heritable variation within O. biennis populations. From an ecological perspective, field experiments show that genetic variation and evolution within populations can have cascading effects throughout communities. Plant genotype affects the preference and performance of individual arthropod populations, as well as the composition, biomass, total abundance and diversity of arthropod species on plants. A combination of experiments and simulation models show that natural selection on specific plant traits can drive rapid ecological changes in these same community variables. At the patch level, increasing genotypic diversity leads to a greater abundance and diversity of omnivorous and predaceous arthropods, which is also associated with increased biomass and fecundity of plants in genetically diverse patches. Finally, in questioning whether a community genetics perspective is needed in biology, I review several multifactorial experiments which show that plant genotype often explains as much variation in community variables as other ecological factors typically identified as most important in ecology. As a whole, research in the O. biennis system has contributed to a more complete understanding of the dynamic interplay between ecology, evolution and genetics. © 2010 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.},

abstract={Studying the genetic basis of traits involved in ecological interactions is a fundamental part of elucidating the connections between evolutionary and ecological processes. Such knowledge allows one to link genetic models of trait evolution with ecological models describing interactions within and between species. Previous work has shown that connections between genetic and ecological processes in Arabidopsis thaliana may be mediated by the fact that quantitative trait loci (QTL) with 'direct' effects on traits of individuals also have pleiotropic 'indirect' effects on traits expressed in neighbouring plants. Here, we further explore these connections by examining functional relationships between traits affected directly and indirectly by the same QTL.We develop a novel approach using structural equation models (SEMs) to determine whether observed pleiotropic effects result from traits directly affected by the QTL in focal individuals causing the changes in the neighbours' phenotypes. This hypothesis was assessed using SEMs to test whether focal plant phenotypes appear to mediate the connection between the focal plants' genotypes and the phenotypes of their neighbours, or alternatively, whether the connection between the focal plants' genotypes and the neighbours' phenotypes is mediated by unmeasured traits. We implement this analysis using a QTL of major effect that maps to the well-characterized flowering locus, FRIGIDA. The SEMs support the hypothesis that the pleiotropic indirect effects of this locus arise from size and developmental timing-related traits in focal plants affecting the expression of developmental traits in their neighbours. Our findings provide empirical insights into the genetics and nature of intraspecific ecological interactions. Our technique holds promise in directing future work into the genetic basis and functional relationship of traits mediating and responding to ecological interactions. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Background: An association study between single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNP) and (innate and adaptive) immune parameters but also feather condition score on the back, rump and belly of laying hens was performed. The immune parameters measured in blood samples were natural and acquired antibody titers and complement activity. Feather condition score as a measure of feather damage was determined, this parameter is closely related to feather pecking behavior in hens housed in groups. The aim of the study was to detect associations between genetic markers and immune parameters and feather condition score across nine lines of laying hens, focusing on the feather peckers as well as on the victims of feather pecking. Methods: A novel approach based on across-line analysis and testing of the SNP-by-line interaction was performed. Results: In total 59 significant associations between SNP and immune traits were detected. Previously identified QTL were confirmed and new associations of genes regulating immune function identified. The IL17A gene (chromosome 3) influences natural and acquired antibody titers and activation of classical and alternative complement pathways. The major histocompatibility complex on chromosome 16 showed significant association with natural and acquired antibody titers and classical complement activity. The IL12B and IRF1 genes on chromosome 13 were associated with natural antibody titers. The direct effect of the genotype of an individual on its feather condition and the associative effect of the genotype of the cage mates on the individual's feather condition were analyzed. The direct genetic effect can be described as the susceptibility to be pecked at, and the associative genetic effect as the propensity to perform feather pecking. Eleven significant associations were detected for the direct effect, and 81 for the associative effect. The serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) on chromosome 4 was highlighted in both analyses. Conclusions: Our results confirmed previously identified QTL and identified new associations of genes regulating immune function. The results for feather condition score supports existing evidence of involvement of the serotonergic system in feather pecking in laying hens. Immune regulatory genes were found to be associated to feather condition score, revealing relationships between the immune system and behavior. © 2011 van der Poel et al;.},

The quality examination of the AD-cDNA library showed that the transformation efficiency was 1.0 x 10(6) transformants/3 microg pGADT7-Rec DNA, and the average length of cDNA inserts was around 1.0 kb. The library was then screened with the leghemoglobin AsB2510 as bait by yeast two-hybrid system, and 26 positive clones was obtained on SD/-Leu/-Trp/-His/-Ade containing X-gal. 10 of them were individually further confirmed by resuing the plasmid, amplifying the cDNA insert and retesting the protein-interacting phenotype. The cDNA inserts of positive clones were sequenced and undertaken a blast analysis in NCBI database, it was found that clone LY-53 contained a tify domain and divergent CCT motif, which was an important transcription factor needs in-depth investigation.},

abstract={Background: Mortality due to cannibalism in laying hens is a difficult trait to improve genetically, because censoring is high (animals still alive at the end of the testing period) and it may depend on both the individual itself and the behaviour of its group members, so-called associative effects (social interactions). To analyse survival data, survival analysis can be used. However, it is not possible to include associative effects in the current software for survival analysis. A solution could be to combine survival analysis and a linear animal model including associative effects. This paper presents a two-step approach (2STEP), combining survival analysis and a linear animal model including associative effects (LAM). Methods. Data of three purebred White Leghorn layer lines from Institut de Sélection Animale B.V., a Hendrix Genetics company, were used in this study. For the statistical analysis, survival data on 16,780 hens kept in four-bird cages with intact beaks were used. Genetic parameters for direct and associative effects on survival time were estimated using 2STEP. Cross validation was used to compare 2STEP with LAM. LAM was applied directly to estimate genetic parameters for social effects on observed survival days. Results: Using 2STEP, total heritable variance, including both direct and associative genetic effects, expressed as the proportion of phenotypic variance, ranged from 32% to 64%. These results were substantially larger than when using LAM. However, cross validation showed that 2STEP gave approximately the same survival curves and rank correlations as LAM. Furthermore, cross validation showed that selection based on both direct and associative genetic effects, using either 2STEP or LAM, gave the best prediction of survival time. Conclusion: It can be concluded that 2STEP can be used to estimate genetic parameters for direct and associative effects on survival time in laying hens. Using 2STEP increased the heritable variance in survival time. Cross validation showed that social genetic effects contribute to a large difference in survival days between two extreme groups. Genetic selection targeting both direct and associative effects is expected to reduce mortality due to cannibalism in laying hens. © 2010 Ellen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Social interactions among individuals are abundant both in natural and domestic populations. Such social interactions cause phenotypes of individuals to depend on genes carried by other individuals, a phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects (IGE). Because IGEs have drastic effects on the rate and direction of response to selection, knowledge of their magnitude and relationship to direct genetic effects (DGE) is indispensable for understanding response to selection. Very little is known, however, of statistical power and optimum experimental designs for estimating IGEs. This work, therefore, presents expressions for the standard errors of the estimated (co)variances of DGEs and IGEs and identifies optimum experimental designs for their estimation. It also provides an expression for optimum family size and a numerical investigation of optimum group size. Designs with groups composed of two families were optimal and substantially better than designs with groups composed at random with respect to family. Results suggest that IGEs can be detected with ∼1000-2000 individuals and/or ∼250-500 groups when using optimum designs. Those values appear feasible for agriculture and aquaculture and for the smaller laboratory species. In summary, this work provides the tools to optimize and quantify the required size of experiments aiming to identify IGEs. An R-package SE.IGE is available, which predicts SEs and identifies optimum family and group sizes. Copyright © 2010 by the Genetics Society of America.},

abstract={Social interactions, especially those involving competition among individuals, are important in domesticated livestock and in natural populations. The heritability of traits affected by such interactions has two components, one originating in the individual like that of classical traits (direct effects) and the other originating in other group members (indirect effects). The latter type of trait represents a significant source of 'hidden heritability' and it requires population structure and knowledge from relatives in order to access it for selective breeding. When ignored, competitive interactions may increase as an indirect response to direct selection, resulting in diminished yields. We illustrate how population genetic structure affects the response to selection of traits with indirect genetic effects using population genetic and quantitative genetic theory. Population genetic theory permits us to connect our results to the existing body of theory on kin and group selection in natural populations. The quantitative genetic perspective allows us to see how breeders have used knowledge from relatives and family selection in the domestication of plants and animals to improve the welfare and production of livestock by incorporating social genetic effects in the breeding program. We illustrate the central features of these models by reviewing empirical studies from domesticated chickens. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={An association study between SNP markers and feather condition score on the back, rump and belly of laying hens was performed. Feather condition score is a measure of feather damage, which has been shown to be closely related to feather pecking behaviour in hens housed in groups. A population of 662 hens was genotyped for 1536 SNPs of which 1022 could be used for the association study. The analysis was conducted across 9 different lines of White Leghorn and Rhode Island Red origin. Across lines linkage disequilibrium is conserved at shorter distances than within lines; therefore, SNPs significantly associated with feather condition score across lines are expected to be closer to the functional mutations. The SNPs that had a significant across-line effect but did not show significant SNP-by-line interaction were identified, to test that the association was consistent across lines. Both the direct effect of the individual's genotype on its plumage condition, and the associative effect of the genotype of the cage mates on the individual's plumage condition were analysed. The direct genetic effect can be considered as the susceptibility to be pecked at, whereas the associative genetic effect can be interpreted as the propensity to perform feather pecking. Finally, 11 significant associations between SNPs and behavioural traits were detected in the direct model, and 81 in the associative model. A role of the gene for the serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C) on chromosome 4 was found. This supports existing evidence of a prominent involvement of the serotonergic system in the modulation of this behavioural disorder in laying hens. The genes for IL9, IL4, CCL4 and NFKB were found to be associated to plumage condition, revealing relationships between the immune system and behaviour. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is heritable social variation in ADG from birth until weaning in piglets. Nursing and the establishment of teat order are sources of social interaction among suckling piglets nursed by the same sow. If a heritable social effect is present, but ignored, the selected animals might be the most competitive ones with negative effects on growth of their group mates, resulting in less response to selection than expected. The social interaction model was extended with a maternal component to estimate genetic maternal and social effects. Four different animal models were compared: a basic model with a direct heritable effect only; a social model accounting for direct and social heritable effects; a maternal model with a heritable maternal effect in addition to the basic model; and a social-maternal model accounting for direct, social, and maternal heritable effects. Estimates of direct, maternal, and social heritability were 0.07, 0.06, and around 0.0007 (not significantly different from zero, SE = 0.0005), respectively. Total heritable variance, including direct, social, and maternal heritable variance and their covariances ranged from 0.07 to 0.15 of the phenotypic variation. Both maternal models were significantly better than equivalent nonmaternal models (P < 0.005). The social model was not significantly better than the basic model (P = 0.102), and the social-maternal model was also not significantly better than the maternal model (P = 0.486). There was no evidence for heritable social effects among piglets in a group. The generally used maternal model fit the data as well as the social-maternal model. Sufficient cross-fostering is needed to partition social and maternal variation. © 2010 American Society of Animal Science.},

abstract={When individuals interact, phenotypic variation can be partitioned into direct genetic effects (DGEs) of the individuals' own genotypes, indirect genetic effects (IGEs) of their social partners' genotypes and epistatic interactions between the genotypes of interacting individuals ('genotype-by-genotype (G×G) epistasis'). These components can all play important roles in evolutionary processes, but few empirical studies have examined their importance. The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum provides an ideal system to measure these effects during social interactions and development. When starved, free-living amoebae aggregate and differentiate into a multicellular fruiting body with a dead stalk that holds aloft viable spores. By measuring interactions among a set of natural strains, we quantify DGEs, IGEs and G×G epistasis affecting spore formation. We find that DGEs explain most of the phenotypic variance (57.6%) whereas IGEs explain a smaller (13.3%) but highly significant component. Interestingly, G×G epistasis explains nearly a quarter of the variance (23.0%), highlighting the complex nature of genotype interactions. These results demonstrate the large impact that social interactions can have on development and suggest that social effects should play an important role in developmental evolution in this system. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={Studies of experimental sexual selection have tested the effect of variation in the intensity of sexual selection on male investment in reproduction, particularly sperm. However, in several species, including Drosophila pseudoobscura, no sperm response to experimental evolution has occurred. Here, we take a quantitative genetics approach to examine whether genetic constraints explain the limited evolutionary response. We quantified direct and indirect genetic variation, and genetic correlations within and between the sexes, in experimental populations of D. pseudoobscura. We found that sperm number may be limited by low heritability and evolvability whereas sperm quality (length) has moderate VA and CVA but does not evolve. Likewise, the female reproductive tract, suggested to drive the evolution of sperm, did not respond to experimental sexual selection even though there was sufficient genetic variation. The lack of genetic correlations between the sexes supports the opportunity for sexual conflict over investment in sperm by males and their storage by females. Our results suggest no absolute constraint arising from a lack of direct or indirect genetic variation or patterns of genetic covariation. These patterns show why responses to experimental evolution are hard to predict, and why research on genetic variation underlying interacting reproductive traits is needed. © 2010 The Author(s).

abstract={Indirect genetics effects (IGEs)-when the genotype of one individual affects the phenotypic expression of a trait in another-may alter evolutionary trajectories beyond that predicted by standard quantitative genetic theory as a consequence of genotypic evolution of the social environment. For IGEs to occur, the trait of interest must respond to one or more indicator traits in interacting conspecifics. In quantitative genetic models of IGEs, these responses (reaction norms) are termed interaction effect coefficients and are represented by the parameter psi (Ψ). The extent to which Ψ exhibits genetic variation within a population, and may therefore itself evolve, is unknown. Using an experimental evolution approach, we provide evidence for a genetic basis to the phenotypic response caused by IGEs on sexual display traits in Drosophila serrata. We show that evolution of the response is affected by sexual but not natural selection when flies adapt to a novel environment. Our results indicate a further mechanism by which IGEs can alter evolutionary trajectories-the evolution of interaction effects themselves. © 2010 The Author(s).

abstract={Female reproductive performance can be strongly affected by male care, so that breeding time, a trait expressed only by females, can be seen as one trait determined by both male and female genotypes. Animal model analyses of a 46-year study of red-billed gulls (Larus novaehollandiae scopulinus) revealed that laying date was not heritable in females (h2 = 0.001 ± 0.030), but significantly so in males (h2 = 0.134 ± 0.029). Heritability of breeding time in males probably reflects genetic variability in some other trait such as courtship feeding ability. In line with predictions of evolutionary models incorporating indirect genetic effects, the strong and consistent directional selection for advanced breeding time has not resulted in detectable selection response in males. Our results demonstrate that a female trait is largely determined by genetic characteristics of its mate, and hence, any evolutionary change in red-billed gull breeding time depends critically on genetic variation in males. © 2010 The Authors.

Correlations of estimated breeding values between ADG and DFI, DOT, and DFR were 0.46, 0.04 and 0.29 for dominant pigs. Given heritable cooperation, subordinate pigs tended to increase feed intake (r=0.36) and eating rate (r =0.25). Given heritable competition, subordinate pigs fail to compensate for the competition with decreased feed intake (r = -0.53).

abstract={Background: In species across taxa, offspring have means to influence parental investment (PI). PI thus evolves as an interacting phenotype and indirect genetic effects may strongly affect the co-evolutionary dynamics of offspring and parental behaviors. Evolutionary theory focused on explaining how exaggerated offspring solicitation can be understood as resolution of parent-offspring conflict, but the evolutionary origin and diversification of different forms of family interactions remains unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: In contrast to previous theory that largely uses a static approach to predict how "offspring individuals" and "parental individuals" should interact given conflict over PI, we present a dynamic theoretical framework of antagonistic selection on the PI individuals obtain/take as offspring and the PI they provide as parents to maximize individual lifetime reproductive success; we analyze a deterministic and a stochastic version of this dynamic framework. We show that a zone for equivalent co-adaptation outcomes exists in which stable levels of PI can evolve and be maintained despite fast strategy transitions and ongoing co-evolutionary dynamics. Under antagonistic co-adaptation, costfree solicitation can evolve as an adaptation to emerging preferences in parents. Conclusions/Significance:We show that antagonistic selection across the offspring and parental life-stage of individuals favors co-adapted offspring and parental behavior within a zone of equivalent outcomes. This antagonistic parent-offspring co-adaptation does not require solicitation to be costly, allows for rapid divergence and evolutionary novelty and potentially explains the origin and diversification of the observed provisioning forms in family life. © 2010 Kölliker et al.},

Social behaviour is best described as an interacting phenotype: a phenotype that depends at least in part on interactions with social partners for its expression. Models of indirect genetic effects provide a quantitative genetic framework for understanding the sources of variation underlying interacting phenotypes. They also suggest a genetic mechanism for inheriting traits that are expressed among rather than within individual animals, and identify selection arising from the interactions (termed social selection). This chapter will first introduce the concepts of interacting phenotypes, indirect genetic effects, and social selection. We build a quantitative genetic model for interacting phenotypes and discuss how the evolution of such traits differs from non-interacting traits. We then explore the parameters of the model in more depth. We subsequently summarise existing empirical studies of indirect genetic effects, discuss the implications for the evolution of behavioural traits through social selection, and discuss transitions between quantitative genetic and molecular genetic approaches to studying behavioural evolution. Finally, we highlight potential future avenues of research. © Cambridge University Press 2010.},

abstract={Interactions among conspecifics influence social evolution through two distinct but intimately related paths. First, they provide the opportunity for indirect genetic effects (IGEs), where genes expressed in one individual influence the expression of traits in others. Second, interactions can generate social selection when traits expressed in one individual influence the fitness of others. Here, we present a quantitative genetic model of multivariate trait evolution that integrates the effects of both IGEs and social selection, which have previously been modeled independently. We show that social selection affects evolutionary change whenever the breeding value of one individual covaries with the phenotype of its social partners. This covariance can be created by both relatedness and IGEs, which are shown to have parallel roles in determining evolutionary response. We show that social selection is central to the estimation of inclusive fitness and derive a version of Hamilton's rule showing the symmetrical effects of relatedness and IGEs on the evolution of altruism. We illustrate the utility of our approach using altruism, greenbeards, aggression, and weapons as examples. Our model provides a general predictive equation for the evolution of social phenotypes that encompasses specific cases such as kin selection and reciprocity. The parameters can be measured empirically, and we emphasize the importance of considering both IGEs and social selection, in addition to relatedness, when testing hypotheses about social evolution. © 2010 The Author(s).

abstract={Competition and cooperation is fundamental to evolution by natural selection, both in animals and plants. Here, I investigate the consequences of such interactions for response in fitness due to natural selection. I provide quantitative genetic expressions for heritable variance and response in fitness due to natural selection when conspecifics interact. Results show that interactions among conspecifics generate extra heritable variance in fitness, and that interacting with kin is the key to evolutionary success because it translates the extra heritable variance into response in fitness. This work also unifies Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection (FTNS) and Hamilton's inclusive fitness (IF). The FTNS implies that natural selection maximizes fitness, whereas Hamilton proposed maximization of IF. This work shows that the FTNS describes the increase in IF, rather than direct fitness, at a rate equal to the additive genetic variance in fitness. Thus, Hamilton's IF and Fisher's FTNS both describe the maximization of IF. © 2009 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract={Increased female reproductive rates usually result in accelerated senescence. This correlation provides a link between the evolutionary conflict of the sexes and aging when ejaculate components elevate female reproductive rates at the cost of future reproduction. It is not clear whether this female cost is manifest as shorter lifespan or an earlier onset or a steeper rate of reproductive senescence. It also is unclear whether beneficial ejaculates release females from reproductive trade-offs and, if so, which senescence parameters are affected. We examined these issues in the bedbug, Cimex lectularius, a long-lived insect that shows reduced female lifespan as well as female reproductive senescence at the male-determined mating frequency. We demonstrate experimentally that, independently of the mating frequency, females receiving more ejaculate show increased reproductive rates and enter reproductive senescence later than females receiving less ejaculate. The rate of reproductive senescence did not differ between treatments, and reproductive rates did not predict mortality. The ejaculate effects were consistent in inter- and intra-population crosses, suggesting they have not evolved recently and are not caused by inbreeding. Our results suggest that ejaculate components compensate for the costs of elevated female reproductive rates in bedbugs by delaying the onset of reproductive senescence. Ejaculate components that are beneficial to polyandrous females could have arisen because male traits that protect the ejaculate have positive pleiotropic effects and/or because female counter-adaptations to antagonistic male traits exceed the neutralization of those traits. That males influence female reproductive senescence has important consequences for trade-offs between reproduction and longevity and for studies of somatic senescence.},

abstract={Understanding the nature of selection against deleterious alleles is central to determining how populations are affected by the constant influx of new mutations. Important progress has been made in estimating basic attributes of the distribution of selection coefficients and gene interaction effects (epistasis). Although most aspects of selection are likely to be context dependent, little is known about the effect of stress on selection and epistasis at the level of individual genes, especially in multicellular organisms. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we measure how selection on 20 mutant alleles is affected by direct and indirect genetic factors across two environments. We find that environmental stress increases selection against individual mutations but reduces selection against combinations of mutations (i.e., epistasis becomes more positive). In addition, we find a high incidence of indirect genetic effects whereby the strength of selection against the alleles carried by offspring is dependent on the genotypes of their parents. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={Despite a massive research effort, our understanding of the evolution of female mate choice remains incomplete [1, 2]. A central problem is that the predominating empirical research tradition has focused on male traits, yet the key question is whether female choice traits are maintained because of direct effects on female fitness or because of indirect genetic effects in offspring that may be associated with such traits. Here, we address this question by using a novel research strategy that employs experimental phenotypic manipulation of a female choice trait in an insect model system, the seed beetle Callosobruchus chinensis (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). We show that females with increased efficiency of choice enjoy strongly elevated fitness compared to females with reduced choice efficiency. In contrast, we found no effects of female choice efficiency on offspring fitness. Our results show that female choice is maintained by direct selection in females in this system, whereas indirect selection is relatively weak at most. We suggest that phenotypic engineering of female choice traits can greatly advance our ability to elucidate the relative importance of direct and indirect selection for the maintenance of female choice. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={In recent years much progress has been made towards understanding the selective forces involved in the evolution of social behaviour including conflicts over reproduction among group members. Here, I argue that an important additional step necessary for advancing our understanding of the resolution of potential conflicts within insect societies is to consider the genetics of the behaviours involved. First, I discuss how epigenetic modifications of behaviour may affect conflict resolution within groups. Second, I review known natural polymorphisms of social organization to demonstrate that a lack of consideration of the genetic mechanisms involved may lead to erroneous explanations of the adaptive significance of behaviour. Third, I suggest that, on the basis of recent genetic studies of sexual conflict in Drosophila, it is necessary to reconsider the possibility of within-group manipulation by means of chemical substances (i.e. pheromones). Fourth, I address the issue of direct versus indirect genetic effects, which is of particular importance for the study of behaviour in social groups. Fifth, I discuss the issue of how a genetic influence on dominance hierarchies and reproductive division of labour can have secondary effects, for example in the evolution of promiscuity. Finally, because the same sets of genes (e.g. those implicated in chemical signalling and the responses that are triggered) may be used even in species as divergent as ants, cooperative breeding birds and primates, an integration of genetic mechanisms into the field of social evolution may also provide unifying ideas. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract={In genetic association studies, different complex phenotypes are often associated with the same marker. Such associations can be indicative of pleiotropy (i.e. common genetic causes), of indirect genetic effects via one of these phenotypes, or can be solely attributable to non-genetic/ environmental links between the traits. To identify the phenotypes with the inducing genetic association, statistical methodology is needed that is able to distinguish between the different causes of the genetic associations. Here, we propose a simple, general adjustment principle that can be incorporated into many standard genetic association tests which are then able to infer whether an SNP has a direct biological influence on a given trait other than through the SNP's influence on another correlated phenotype. Using simulation studies, we show that, in the presence of a non-marker related link between phenotypes, standard association tests without the proposed adjustment can be biased. In contrast to that, the proposed methodology remains unbiased. Its achieved power levels are identical to those of standard adjustment methods, making the adjustment principle universally applicable in genetic association studies. The principle is illustrated by an application to three genome-wide association analyses. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={The solicitation behaviours performed by dependent young are under selection from the environment created by their parents, as well as wider ecological conditions. Here we show how mechanisms acting before hatching enable canary offspring to adapt their begging behaviour to a variable post-hatching world. Cross-fostering experiments revealed that canary nestling begging intensity is positively correlated with the provisioning level of their own parents (to foster chicks). When we experimentally increased food quality before and during egg laying, mothers showed higher faecal androgen levels and so did their nestlings, even when they were cross-fostered before hatching to be reared by foster mothers that had been exposed to a standard regime of food quality. Higher parental androgen levels were correlated with greater levels of post-hatching parental provisioning and (we have previously shown) increased faecal androgens in chicks were associated with greater begging intensity. We conclude that androgens mediate environmentally induced plasticity in the expression of both parental and offspring traits, which remain correlated as a result of prenatal effects, probably acting within the egg. Offspring can thus adapt their begging intensity to variable family and ecological environments. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Timing of flowering is central to reproductive success and is currently advancing in many natural populations due to a warmer climate. However, we have little understanding of how earlier initiation of flowering influences subsequent reproductive phenology or the expression of traits in the offspring. To evaluate the consequences of an altered flowering phenology we manipulated cohorts of Campanulastrum americanum, an herb with annual and biennial growth forms, to flower and disperse seeds up to a month earlier, at the same time, and up to a month later than a natural population in two separate years. Relative to the date of first flower, the temporal patterns of flower production and the timing of fruit maturation and seed dispersal were similar among individuals that initiated flowering over the expanded reproductive season, indicating strong phenological integration of reproductive traits. However, plants that initiated flowering substantially outside the natural window showed a change in the rate of reproduction, with a compressed reproductive schedule for early-flowering individuals and an expanded one for late-flowering plants. Changes in flowering time had more dramatic effects on the offspring generation. Initiation of flowering two weeks earlier would result in a fourfold increase in the frequency of annual offspring, and four weeks earlier would result in a tenfold increase. The frequency of annuals was less sensitive to modest delays in flowering time but decreased with greater delays in flowering time. Collectively, these results reveal a tightly integrated reproductive phenology that shifts with timing of flowering within generations but may lead to more dramatic responses to climate change between generations. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={How and why cooperation evolves, particularly among nonrelatives, remains a major paradox for evolutionary biologists and behavioral ecologists. Although much attention has focused on fitness consequences associated with cooperating, relatively little is known about the second component of evolutionary change, the inheritance of cooperation or reciprocity. The genetics of behaviors that can only be expressed in the context of interactions are particularly difficult to describe because the relevant genes reside in multiple social partners. Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) describe the influence of genes carried in social partners on the phenotype of a focal individual and thus provide a novel approach to quantifying the genetics underlying interactions such as reciprocal cooperation. We used inbred lines of guppies and a novel application of IGE theory to describe the dual genetic control of predator inspection and social behavior, both classic models of reciprocity. We identified effects of focal strain, social group strain, and interactions between focal and group strains on variation in focal behavior. We measured ψ, the coefficient of the interaction, which describes the degree to which an individual's phenotype is influenced by the phenotype of its social partners. The genetic identity of social partners substantially influences inspection behavior, measures of threat assessment, and schooling and does so in positively reinforcing manner. We therefore demonstrate strong IGEs for antipredator behavior that represent the genetic variation necessary for the evolution of reciprocity. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

Here, we extend population genetic theory developed for maternal-effect genes to predict the equilibrium polymorphism within species and sequence divergence among species for genes with social effects on fitness. We show how the fitness effects of genes, mating system, and genetic system affect predicted gene polymorphism. We find that, because genes with indirect social effects on fitness effectively experience weaker selection, they are expected to harbor higher levels of polymorphism relative to genes with direct fitness effects. The relative increase in polymorphism is proportional to the inverse of the genetic relatedness between individuals expressing the gene and their social partners that experience the fitness effects of the gene. We find a similar pattern of more rapid divergence between populations or species for genes with indirect social effects relative to genes with direct effects. We focus our discussion on the social insects, organisms with diverse indirect genetic effects, mating and genetic systems, and we suggest specific examples for testing our predictions with emerging sociogenomic tools. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

abstract={Indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which occur when phenotypic expression in one individual is influenced by genes in another conspecific individual, may have a drastic effect on evolutionary response to selection. General evolutionary models of IGEs have been developed using two distinct theoretical frameworks derived from maternal effects theory. The first framework is trait-based and focuses on how phenotypes are influenced by specific traits in a social partner, with the strength of interactions defined by the matrix Ψ. The second framework partitions total genetic variance into components representing direct effects, indirect effects, and the covariance between them, without identifying specific social traits responsible for IGEs. The latter framework has been employed more commonly by empiricists because the methods for estimating variance components are relatively straightforward. Here, we show how these two theoretical frameworks are related to each other and derive equations that can be used to translate between them. This translation leads to a generalized method that can be used to estimate Ψ via standard quantitative genetic breeding designs or pedigrees from natural populations. This method can be used in a very general set of circumstances and is widely applicable to all IGEs, including maternal effects and other interactions among relatives. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

abstract={Theory for the evolution of social interactions based on continuous strategies often assumes for simplicity that expressed behaviours are independent of previous encounters. In reality, however, such dependencies are likely to be widespread and often strong, generating complex behavioural dynamics. To model this process and illustrate potential consequences for the evolution of behavioural interactions, we consider the behavioural dynamics of the interaction between caring parents and their demanding offspring, a prime example of long series of interdependent and highly dynamic interactions. These dynamics can be modelled using functions describing mechanisms for how parents and their offspring respond to each other in the interaction. We establish the general conditions under which the behavioural dynamics converge towards a proximate equilibrium and refer to such converging interactions as behaviourally stable strategies (BSSs). We further demonstrate that there is scope for behavioural instability under realistic conditions; that is, whenever parents and/or offspring 'overreact' beyond some threshold. By applying the derived condition for behavioural stability to evolutionary models of parent-offspring conflict resolution, we show by numerical simulations that evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) of current models are not necessarily behaviourally stable. Because behavioural instability implies that expressed levels of behaviours deviate from the ESS, behavioural stability is required for strict evolutionary stability in repeated behavioural interactions. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Developments in genetics and genomics relevant for poultry breeding are reviewed, focusing on the use of molecular information in breeding programmes and the potential for improving traits affected by social interactions among individuals. QTL mapping studies have resulted in almost 700 QTL for a wide variety of traits, showing that they have been successful. However, few applications of marker-assisted selection in commercial poultry breeding exist, mainly because evidence for the QTL is often not conclusive and confidence intervals for QTL locations are large, making utilization in practice difficult. Moreover, moving from QTL to causal mutation has been successful only in a few cases. Thus, neither MAS nor selection for known genes will greatly increase responses to selection in the near future. Genome-wide selection (GWS), however, may offer a solution. Basically GWS is a method to estimate breeding values. Simulation studies suggest that accuracies of EBVs in the range of 0.7-0.8 are feasible. Tests of GWS on real data are currently ongoing, and initial results are promising. The second section of this chapter shows that social interactions create considerable heritable variance that is hidden in classical analyses. Results show that social effects contribute more than half of the heritable variance in mortality due to cannibalism in laying hens, and in growth rate and feed intake in growing pigs. We present statistical models and breeding strategies to utilize this extra heritable variation for genetic improvement. Though social genetic effects may not always be important or may be difficult to use in some cases, the promising results observed in laying hens and pigs should be sufficient incentive for further research in this area. © CAB International 2009.},

abstract={Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that maintain genetic variation in natural populations is one of the fundamental goals of evolutionary biology. There is growing evidence that genotype-by-environment interaction (G × E) can maintain additive genetic variance (V A), but we lack information on the relative performance of genotypes under the competitive situations encountered in the field. Competing genotypes may influence each other, and this interaction is also subject to selection through indirect genetic effects (IGE). Here, we explore how genotypes perform when interacting and evaluate IGE in order to understand its influence on V A for sexually-selected traits in the lesser waxmoth, Achroia grisella. We found that inter-genotype differences and crossover interactions under joint rearing are equal to or greater than values when reared separately. A focal genotype exhibited different performances when jointly reared with various genotypes-suggesting that IGE may be responsible for the increased levels of crossover and differences in performance observed. We suggest that some genotypes are superior competitors for food acquisition in the larval stage, and that these differences influence the development and evolution of other genotypes through IGE. We reaffirm the role of G × E in maintaining V A and note the general importance of IGE in studies of evolutionary mechanisms. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={There is mounting evidence in a variety of taxa that females increase offspring quality by mating with multiple males, often resulting in multiple paternity. In birds, however, few studies have explicitly examined the benefits of mating with several different males; instead, the focus has been on whether or not extra-pair mating occurs, and its adaptive significance remains controversial. We examined the hypothesis that offspring quality, particularly immune response (phytohaemagglutinin assay) and growth, increases with the number of sires in broods of socially monogamous tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). We found one of the highest known levels of multiple paternity in birds (84% of nests with two or more extra-pair young had at least two extra-pair sires). Among nests with extra-pair young, the number and diversity of sires continued to increase linearly with the number of extra-pair young, so there was no evidence that some males monopolized paternity at high levels of extra-pair fertilization. Indeed, the number of sires was actually greater than expected in large broods, suggesting that some females might be seeking more mates. We found no effect of the number of sires on nestling immune response or growth. In mixed paternity broods, the immune response of extra-pair young did not differ from that of their within-pair half-siblings. However, among all broods, nestlings had a stronger immune response in nests with at least one extra-pair nestling than in nests with all within-pair nestlings. These results are not consistent with a good genes benefit of extra-pair mating, but they do suggest that there are environmental effects associated with extra-pair mating that increase nestling immune response. These environmental effects could produce indirect genetic effects on sexual selection if they are heritable. The extraordinarily high number of sires in this species highlights a relatively unexplored source of sexual selection in birds. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Social interactions pervade all aspects of life in the social insects. Networks of interacting nestmates enable the maintenance of colony homeostasis and regulation of brood development. Artificial colony-level selection on the amount of pollen stored in honeybee colonies has produced high- and low-pollen-hoarding strains that have been used as a model system to study the genetic and physiological basis of differences in forager behavior that contribute to colony-level differences in pollen hoarding. Here we extend this model system using an interacting-phenotypes approach that explicitly studies genetic components arising from social interactions. High- and low-pollen-hoarding-strain larvae were reared in hives with high- or low-strain older larvae and high- or low-strain adult workers. The ovariole number and dry mass of focal individuals depended on interactions between the genotypes of the focal individuals and their brood and adult worker nestmates. These results show that trait expression by individual honeybee workers is modulated by the genotypic composition of the colony, indicating that individual-level phenotypes are properties of the composite "sociogenome." Thus, colony-level selection has produced strains with distinct combinations of socially interacting genes, which make up the social networks that regulate development and expressed phenotypes. © 2009 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Aggressive behaviours are necessarily expressed in a social context, such that individuals may be influenced by the phenotypes, and potentially the genotypes, of their social partners. Consequently, it has been hypothesized that indirect genetic effects (IGEs) arising from the social environment will provide a major source of heritable variation on which selection can act. However, there has been little empirical scrutiny of this to date. Here we test this hypothesis in an experimental population of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using quantitative genetic models of five aggression traits, we find repeatable and heritable differences in agonistic behaviours of focal individuals when presented with an opponent mouse. For three of the traits, there is also support for the presence of IGEs, and estimated correlations between direct and indirect genetic (rAO,F) effects were high. As a consequence, any selection for aggression in the focal individuals should cause evolution of the social environment as a correlated response. In two traits, strong positive rAO,F will cause the rapid evolution of aggression, while in a third case changes in the phenotypic mean will be constrained by negative covariance between direct and IGEs. Our results illustrate how classical analyses may miss important components of heritable variation, and show that a full understanding of evolutionary dynamics requires explicit consideration of the genetic component of the social environment. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Kin and levels-of-selection models are common approaches for modelling social evolution. Indirect genetic effect (IGE) models represent a different approach, specifying social effects on trait values rather than fitness. We investigate the joint effect of relatedness, multilevel selection and IGEs on response to selection. We present a measure for the degree of multilevel selection, which is the natural partner of relatedness in expressions for response. Response depends on both relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection, rather than only one or the other factor. Moreover, response is symmetric in relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection, indicating that both factors have exactly the same effect. Without IGEs, the key parameter is the product of relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection. With IGEs, however, multilevel selection without relatedness can explain evolution of social traits. Thus, next to relatedness and multilevel selection, IGEs are a key element in the genetical theory of social evolution. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Environmental conditions experienced by a female prior to reproducing may be influenced by her mate. Part of such an indirect effect of a male on his partner's reproduction may be genetic (indirect genetic effect). However, a female's direct and a male's indirect genetic effects need not align. We analyzed 10,652 records of seasonal timing of laying, an important reproductive trait in many organisms, of 1864 male and 1916 female common gulls Larus canus collected during 37 years. We show that there is both a direct (female) and an indirect (male) genetic effect (explaining 14.5% and 4.8% of the REML estimated variance in laying date, respectively), but these are significantly negatively correlated (-0.53 ± 0.22 SE), indicating that genes for early laying in females are associated with genes for a delaying male effect on his partner's laying date (and vice versa). There is strong selection for laying early in this population, and these sexually antagonistic genetic effects may contribute in maintaining the variation in laying date. Our findings provide an empirical demonstration of a hitherto largely unstudied level of conflict between mates, with important ramifications for our understanding of evolutionary dynamics and mate choice in nature. © 2008 The Author(s).},

abstract={Effective communication, often involving pheromones, is a fundamental component of social life. Communication requires interactions to be expressed and it is convenient to consider communication within the context of the theory of interacting phenotypes-those phenotypes that have reduced or no meaning outside of a social context. Pheromonal communication will therefore be subject to social selection and indirect genetic effects and is often highly sophisticated and multifaceted, allowing fine-tuned coordination of messages from senders and receivers. Pheromones can be characterized by nested levels of variation: a multicomponent structure in which individual components contain additional source of variation. An integrated understanding of communication by multi-component chemical signals provides insight into the evolution of social signals in general. Insects are ideal model systems to investigate and disentangle the complexity of pheromones and reveal the underestimated potential for reliability that appears to be hidden in chemical signals and their evolutionary stability. © Oxford University Press, 2013.

abstract={Recent studies question the importance of indirect genetic effects in explaining female benefits of extra-pair matings in socially monogamous species. Compiling data on 14 wild bird species, Arnqvist and Kirkpatrick (Am Nat 165:S26-S37, 2005) estimated the average direct cost in terms or reduced parental care to be an order of magnitude larger than the potential effect of genetic benefits. This study has sparked a debate regarding potential confounding factors but no consensus appears to have been reached. Here we focus on the implicit assumption that all individuals face the same selective pressures and argue that this assumption is probably too strong in most cases. Using a theoretical model we show that when the amount of resources that a male provides depends on territory quality, his physical condition or prospects for alternative breeding opportunities, a female may respond to such differences by altering her mating behaviour. Such confounding factors may lead to direct fitness effects that result in negative correlations between paternal care and paternity even if females that produce extra-pair young experience a net benefit. Negative correlations can also result when males forcefully seek copulations and females resist them. We discuss the studies included in the analysis in this light, and conclude that current analyses on the net selective pressures remain uninformative. In addition to considering average effects across individuals and species we suggest giving attention to individual differences and the influence of ecological factors such as territory quality and predation pressures on female mating behaviour. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Sexual selection requires social interactions, particularly between the sexes. When trait expression is influenced by social interactions, such traits are called interacting phenotypes and only recently have the evolutionary consequences of interacting phenotypes been considered. Here we investigated how variation in relative fitness, or the opportunity for sexual selection, affected the evolutionary trajectories of interacting phenotypes. We used experimentally evolved populations of the naturally promiscuous Drosophila pseudoobscura, in which the numbers of potential interactions between the sexes, and therefore relative fitness, were manipulated by altering natural levels of female promiscuity. We considered two different mating interactions between the sexes: mating speed and copulation duration. We investigated the evolutionary trajectories of means and (co)variances (P) and also the influence of genetic drift on the evolutionary response of these interactions. Our sexual selection treatments did not affect the means of either mating speed or copulation duration, but they did affect P. We found that the means of both traits differed among replicates within each selection treatment whereas the Ps did not. Changes as a consequence of genetic drift were excluded. Our results show that although variable potential strengths of sexual interactions influence the evolution of interacting phenotypes, the influence may be nonlinear. © 2008 The Author(s).},

abstract={The evolution of female promiscuity poses an intriguing problem as benefits of mating with multiple males often have to arise via indirect, genetic, effects. Studies on birds have documented that multiple paternity is common in natural populations but strong evidence for selection via female benefits is lacking. In an attempt to evaluate the evidence more broadly, we review studies of multiple paternity in natural populations of all major groups of nonavian reptiles. Multiple paternity has been documented in all species investigated so far and commonly exists in over 50% of clutches, with particularly high levels in snakes and lizards. Marine turtles and lizards with prolonged pair-bonding have relatively low levels of multiple paternity but levels are nevertheless higher than in many vertebrates with parental care. There is no evidence that high levels of polyandry are driven by direct benefits to females and the evidence that multiple paternity arises from indirect genetic benefits is weak. Instead, we argue that the most parsimonious explanation for patterns of multiple paternity is that it represents the combined effect of mate-encounter frequency and conflict over mating rates between males and females driven by large male benefits and relatively small female costs, with only weak selection via indirect benefits. A crucial step for researchers is to move from correlative approaches to experimental tests of assumptions and predictions of theory under natural settings, using a combination of molecular techniques and behavioural observations. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Conflicts of interest among genetically heterogeneous nestmates in social insect colonies have been emphasized as driving colony resource allocation. However, potential intracolonial conflicts may not actually be realized so that resource allocation could be shaped primarily by among-colony selection that maximizes colony productivity. To elucidate the causal basis of patterns of resource allocation, I experimentally manipulated three fundamental aspects of colony social structure (relatedness among workers, relatedness among larvae, and queen presence) in the ant Temnothorax curvispinosus and measured effects on colony resource allocation to new workers, gynes, and males. The experimental manipulations had widespread effects on patterns of colony resource allocation, but there was little evidence for realized conflicts over the sex ratio and caste ratio. Decreasing nestmate relatedness caused decreased colony productivity, suggesting that more closely related nestmates have more favorably interacting phenotypes. Together, these results suggest that resource allocation in T. curvispinosus may be shaped more by among-colony selection than intracolonial conflict, leading to queen-worker-brood coadaptation. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Mortality due to cannibalism is a major problem in laying hens. Due to prohibition of beak-trimming in the European Union, this problem will increase in the near future. One solution to reduce mortality due to cannibalism is to use genetic selection. Mortality due to cannibalism, however, differs from conventional breeding traits, because it depends on social interactions among individuals. Selection strategies aiming to reduce cannibalism, therefore, should consider both the direct effect of an individual on its own survival and the social effect of the individual on the survival of its group members (the so-called associative effect). Traditional breeding, however, accounts for only the direct effect. Recently, methods have been proposed to estimate variance components and breeding values for both direct and associative effects. This paper presents estimated genetic parameters for direct and associative effects on survival days in 3 purebred laying lines. For the analysis, 16,780 hens with intact beaks were used. When considering only direct effects, heritabilities ranged from 2 through 10%. When considering both direct and associative effects, the total heritable variance, expressed as a proportion of phenotypic variance, ranged from 6 through 19%. These results show that heritable variation in survival days is substantially larger than suggested by conventional direct effects models. This means that prospects for reducing mortality by means of genetic selection are good and may lead to substantial reduction of 1 of the major welfare problems in egg production. ©2008 Poultry Science Association Inc.},

abstract={Quantitative genetics can be used to understand how traits will respond to artificial selection regimes, and therefore, it can be an important tool in the development of selective breeding programs for animal improvement. In order to predict the response to selection, the traditional approach in quantitative genetics partitions phenotypic variation into a heritable genetic component that contributes to the response and a non-heritable environmental component that does not. However, there is an increasing recognition that environmental variation contributed by the social environment provided by conspecifics can ultimately originate from genetically heritably traits in a population of interacting individuals, blurring the distinction between genetic and environmental variation. The presence of these 'social effects' on trait expression means the environment can provide a source of heritable variation that can contribute to trait evolution. Under some conditions, such as when there is competition, the social effects of genotypes on the phenotypes of other individuals may oppose their direct effects on their own phenotypes and, as a result, the evolution of social effects can oppose the evolution of direct genetic effects and thereby can impede the response to selection. Furthermore, when the social effects of genotypes are uncorrelated with their direct effect, the heritable variance contributed by social effects will not contribute to a response to selection on individuals, meaning that a major part of the genetic variance in a population can be unavailable to selective breeding. These constraints can be overcome by using populations of related individuals or through group selection approaches that allow for the social effects to contribute to a response to selection. © 2008 Sociedade Brasileira de Zootecnia.},

abstract={Animal breeding research, reproductive biology, and cellular biogerontology show that fertilization rates and zygote viability critically depend on sperm age. Sexual selection research focuses on differences between male genotypes in sperm performance, such as motility, competitive ability, or compatibility with eggs, but without considering sperm age. A combined view (that the thermodynamically inevitable decline in sperm performance selects for traits in diploid individuals to prevent fertilization with aged sperm) has received very little attention. In this paper, I correct this bias and show that many male and female traits affect sperm aging or the sperm age distribution at any reproductive event. Such traits coincide well with condition-dependent traits considered sexually selected: multiple mating by both sexes, high sperm production rates, the delivery of dense ejaculates containing many sperm (including nonfertilizing types), the packaging of sperm into spermatophores, male and female sperm ejection, sexual coercion, as well as the production of showy antioxidants and various cellular and nuclear repair mechanisms. I conclude that altering the sperm age distribution at any step during reproduction can be an origin of sexually selected traits, and may explain presently observed paternity variation without assuming genetic incompatibility of gametes.

abstract={Natural and sexual selection are crucial factors in the evolutionary process, yet recent reviews show that researchers have focused narrowly on this topic, with the majority of research centered on the morphological traits of single species. However, in the past several years, several bodies of work have emerged that have examined both selection on performance capacity and selection in a community context, and our goal is to highlight these two growing areas and point toward future directions. Recent studies of selection on performance capacity point toward directional selection favoring high levels of performance, and we detected less evidence for selection favoring intermediate (i.e., stabilizing) or bimodal (i.e., disruptive) kinds of performance levels. Studies of selection in a community context, using the paradigm of indirect genetic effects, show significant community heritability and strong capacity for evolution to occur in a community context via the force of natural selection. For future directions, we argue that researchers should shift toward longer-term studies of selection on both individual species and communities, and we also encourage researchers to publish negative selection results for both performance and community studies to act as balancing influences on published positive selection results. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.

abstract={Maternal effects facilitate adaptation to changing environments because they alter individual offspring traits to match current conditions. We show that maternal effects can also resolve context-dependent, correlational selection on multiple offspring traits, promoting adaptation to more complex environments. In side-blotched lizards (Uta stansburiana), two alternative pathways of dorsal pattern induction involve maternal oestradiol and alleles for throat colouration (∼social strategy). In one pathway, females increased yolk oestradiol when mated to yellow-throated sires; oestradiol induced dorsal barring in yellow-throated progeny of both sexes. In another pathway, females elevated yolk oestradiol in response to a high frequency of orange alleles in experimental social neighbourhoods. When the sire lacked yellow alleles, this secondary pathway resulted in striped, orange sons and striped, non-orange daughters. All maternally induced types had high fitness in the wild. These results illustrate a (previously undescribed) mechanism for females to simultaneously resolve differing correlational selection pressures on different progeny. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract={Indirect genetic effects arise when genes expressed in one individual affect the expression of traits in other individuals. The importance of indirect genetic effects has been recognized for a diversity of evolutionary processes including kin selection, sexual selection, community structure and multilevel selection, but data regarding their genetic architecture and prevalence throughout the genome remain scarce, especially for interactions between unrelated individuals. Using a set of 411 Bay-0 x Shahdara Arabidopsis recombinant inbred lines grown with Landsberg neighbours, we examined quantitative trait loci (QTL) having direct and indirect effects on size, developmental, and fitness related traits. Using an interval mapping approach, we identified 15 QTL with direct effects and found that 13 of these QTL had significant indirect effects on trait expression in neighbouring plants. These results suggest widespread pleiotropy, as nearly all direct effect QTL have associated pleiotropic indirect effects. Paradoxically, most indirect effects were of the same sign as direct effects, creating a pattern of nearly universal positive pleiotropy that makes most covariances between direct and indirect effects positive. These results are consistent with a complex genetic basis for intraspecific interactions, but suggest that interactions between neighbouring plants are largely positive, rather than negative as would be expected for competition. In addition to their evolutionary and ecological importance, these pleiotropic relationships between DGE and IGE loci have implications for quantitative genetic studies of natural populations as well as experimental design considerations. Additionally, studies that ignore IGEs may over- or underestimate quantitative genetic parameters, as well as the effect of and variance contributed by QTL. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={Females often prefer males with elaborate traits, even when they receive no direct benefits from their choice. In such situations, mate discrimination presumably has genetic advantages; selective females will produce offspring of higher genetic quality. Over time, persistent female preferences for elaborate secondary-sexual traits in males should erode genetic variance in these traits, eventually eliminating any benefit to the preferences. Yet, strong female preferences persist in many taxa. This puzzle is called the lek paradox and raises two primary questions: do females obtain genetic benefits for offspring by selecting males with elaborate secondary-sexual characteristics and, if so, how is the genetic variation in these male traits maintained? We suggest that indirect genetic effects may help to resolve the lek paradox. Maternal phenotypes, such as habitat selection behaviours and offspring provisioning, often influence the condition and the expression of secondary-sexual traits in sons. These maternal influences are commonly genetic based (i.e. they are indirect genetic effects). Females choosing mates with elaborate traits may receive 'good genes' for daughters in the form of effective maternal characteristics. Recognizing the significance of indirect genetic effects may be important to our understanding of the process and consequences of sexual selection. © 2007 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Although females are expected to maximize their reproductive success with only one or a few matings [1], the females of many species mate with multiple partners [2]. Experimental studies have found evidence for an increase in egg or embryo viability when females mate polyandrously [3]. These studies have been interpreted in the context of genetic-benefit models that propose that multiple mating increases offspring viability because it allows females to select male genotypes that influence viability directly or because it allows females to avoid genetic incompatibility [2, 4-8]. However, no studies have examined directly the precise mechanisms by which parents influence embryo viability. Using a morphological marker that enabled us to determine paternity and survival of embryos sired by individual male crickets in both sperm-competitive and -noncompetitive situations, we show that males inducing high embryo viability enhance the viability of embryos sired by inferior males. These results indicate that paternal effects and interacting phenotypes determine embryo viability. They show that a male's reproductive success is modified by the interaction between indirect genetic effects of sperm competitors. Importantly, our findings show that the benefits accruing to offspring of multiply mated females need not be transmitted genetically. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The results indicate genetic variance for direct, maternal, and sibsocial effects for all traits, except for male mass there was no significant maternal variance, and for sex ratio the variance for direct effects was not separable from maternal variance for the primary sex ratio. Estimates of genetic correlations between direct, maternal, and sibsocial effects were generally negative, indicating that these effects may not evolve independently. These results have broad implications for social insect evolution. For example, the genetic architecture underlying social insect traits may constrain the realization of evolutionary conflicts between social partners. © 2006 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

abstract={The evolutionary analysis of community organization is considered a major frontier in biology. Nevertheless, current explanations for community structure exclude the effects of genes and selection at levels above the individual. Here, we demonstrate a genetic basis for community structure, arising from the fitness consequences of genetic interactions among species (i.e., interspecific indirect genetic effects or IIGEs). Using simulated and natural communities of arthropods inhabiting North American cottonwoods (Populus), we show that when species comprising ecological communities are summarized using a multivariate statistical method, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), the resulting univariate scores can be analyzed using standard techniques for estimating the heritability of quantitative traits. Our estimates of the broad-sense heritability of arthropod communities on known genotypes of cottonwood trees in common gardens explained 56-63% of the total variation in community phenotype. To justify and help interpret our empirical approach, we modeled synthetic communities in which the number, intensity, and fitness consequences of the genetic interactions among species comprising the community were explicitly known. Results from the model suggest that our empirical estimates of broad-sense community heritability arise from heritable variation in a host tree trait and the fitness consequences of IGEs that extend from tree trait to arthropods. When arthropod traits are heritable, interspecific IGEs cause species interactions to change, and community evolution occurs. Our results have implications for establishing the genetic foundations of communities and ecosystems. © 2006 The Society for the Study of Evolution. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Recent studies on hormone-mediated maternal effects in birds have highlighted the influence of variable maternal yolk androgen concentration on offspring phenotype, particularly in terms of early development. If genetic differences between laying females regulate variation in yolk hormone concentration, then this physiological maternal effect is an indirect genetic effect which can provide a basis for the co-evolution of maternal and offspring phenotypes. Thus, we investigated the evolutionary associations between maternally derived yolk testosterone (T) and early developmental traits in passerine birds via a comparative, phylogenetic analysis. Our results from species-correlation and independent contrasts analyses provide convergent evidence for the correlated evolution of maternal yolk T concentration and length of the prenatal developmental period in passerines. Here, we show these traits are significantly negatively associated (species-correlation: p &lt;0.001, r2 = 0.85; independent contrasts: p = 0.005). Our results high-light the need for more studies investigating the role of yolk hormones in evolutionary processes concerning maternal effects. © 2005 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Records of on-test ADG of Large White gilts were analyzed to estimate variance components of direct and associative genetic effects. Models included the effects of contemporary group (farm-barn-batch), birth litter, pen group, and direct and associative additive genetic effects. The area of each pen was 14 m 2. The additive genetic variance was a function of the number of competitors in a group, the additive relationships between the animal performing the record and its pen mates, and the additive relationships between pen mates. To partially account for differences in the number of pen mates, a covariable (q i = 1, 1/n, or 1/n 1/2) was added to the associative genetic effect. There were 4,946 records from 2,409 litters and 362 pen groups. Pen group size ranged from 12 to 16 gilts. Analyses by REML converged very slowly. A grid search showed that the likelihood function was almost flat when the additive genetic associative effect was fitted. Estimates of direct and associative heritability were 0.15 and 0.03, respectively. Within the BLUPF90 family of programs, the mixed-model equations can be set up directly. For variance component estimation, simple programs (REMLF90 and GIBBSF90) worked without modifications, but more optimized programs did not. Estimates obtained using the three values of q i were similar. With the data structure available for this study and under an environment with relative low competition among animals, accurate estimation of associative genetic effects was not possible. Estimation of competitive effects with large pen size is difficult. The magnitude of competition effects may be larger in commercial populations, where housing is denser and food is limited. ©2005 American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The evolution of parent-offspring interactions for the provisioning of care is usually explained as the phenotypic outcome of resolved conflicting selection pressures. However, parental care and offspring solicitation are expected to have complex patterns of inheritance. Here we present a quantitative genetic model of parent-offspring interactions that allows us to investigate the evolutionary maintenance of a state of resolved conflict. We show that offspring solicitation and parental provisioning are expected to become genetically correlated through coadaptation and that their genetic architecture is dictated by an interaction between patterns of selection and the proximate mechanisms regulating supply and demand. When selection is predominately on offspring solicitation, our model suggests that the genetic correlations between provisioning and solicitation are usually positive if provisioning reduces solicitation. Conversely, when selection is predominately on parental provisioning, the correlations are mostly negative as long as parents show a positive response to offspring demand. Empirical estimates of the genetic architecture of traits involved in family interactions fit these predictions. Our model demonstrates how the evolutionary maintenance of parent-offspring interactions can result in variable patterns of coadaptation, and it provides an explanation for the diversity of family interactions within and among species. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={We discuss the evolutionary origin and elaboration of sodality using an indirect genetic effects perspective. Indirect genetic effects models simultaneously consider zygotic genes, genes expressed in social partners (especially mothers and siblings), and the interactions between them. Incorporation of these diverse genetic effects should lead to more realistic models of social evolution. We first review haplodiploidy as a factor that promotes the evolution of eusociality. Social insect biologists have doubted the importance of relatedness asymmetry caused by haplodiploidy and focused on other predisposing factors such as maternal care. However, indirect effects theory shows that maternal care evolves more readily in haplodiploids, especially with inbreeding and despite multiple mating. Because extended maternal care is believed to be a precondition for the evolution of eusociality, the evolutionary bias towards maternal care in haplodiploids may result in a further bias towards eusociality in these groups. Next, we compare kin selection and parental manipulation and then briefly review additional hypotheses for the evolutionary origin of eusociality. We present a verbal model for the evolutionary origin and elaboration of sib-social care from maternal care based on the modification of the timing of expression of maternal care behaviors. Specifically, heterochrony genes cause maternal care behaviors to be expressed prereproductively towards siblings instead of postreproductively towards offspring. Our review demonstrates that both maternal effect genes (expressed in a parental manipulation manner) and direct effect zygotic genes (expressed in an offspring control manner) are likely involved in the evolution of eusociality. We conclude by describing theoretical and empirical advances with indirect genetic effects and sociogenomics, and we provide specific quantitative genetic and genomic predictions from our heterochrony model for the evolutionary origin and elaboration of eusociality.

abstract={Females typically mate with more than one male despite the costs incurred, thus questioning Bateman's principle. A series of genetic benefits have been proposed to account for the evolution of polyandry, including the acquisition of viability genes for offspring. The 'intrinsic male quality' hypothesis suggests that polyandry increases the probability that females produce offspring sired by males that bestow high viability on their offspring. Heritable variation in viability is the basic requirement for the occurrence of this genetic benefit. By using a half-sib breeding design with a species of cricket in which polyandry is known to increase hatching success, we present clear experimental evidence that intrinsic male quality contributes to embryo viability. Despite recent support for the evolution of polyandry based on compatibility of genotypes between males and females, we show that hatching success is not determined by an interaction between paternal and maternal genotypes but rather that sons inherit paternal genes that influence the viability of eggs laid by their mates. Moreover, our data implicate a potential role for indirect genetic effects of male accessory gland products on embryo viability. Additive genetic contributions to embryo viability may be an important factor underlying the frequently observed benefits of polyandrous behaviour. © 2005 European Society for Evolutionary Biology.},

abstract={Evolutionary conflict arises between reproductive partners when alternative reproductive opportunities are available. Sexual conflict can generate sexually antagonistic selection, which mediates sexual selection and intersexual coevolution. However, despite intense interest, the evolutionary implications of sexual conflict remain unresolved. We propose a novel theoretical approach to study the evolution of sexually antagonistic phenotypes based on quantitative genetics and the measure of social selection arising from male-female interactions. We consider the phenotype of one sex as both a genetically influenced evolving trait as well as the (evolving) social environment in which the phenotype of the opposite sex evolves. Several important points emerge from our analysis, including the relationship between direct selection on one sex and indirect effects through selection on the opposite sex. We suggest that the proposed approach may be a valuable tool to complement other theoretical approaches currently used to study sexual conflict. Most importantly, our approach highlights areas where additional empirical data can help clarify the role of sexual conflict in the evolutionary process. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract={During sexual encounters, individuals often use signals, such as display traits, to attract mates. If individuals alter their display traits with respect to the genotype of potential mates, indirect genetic effects (IGEs) may occur in which the genes of one individual influence the phenotype of another. Although IGEs between related individuals have received much attention, their occurrence between unrelated individuals during sexual encounters has not. Here, we demonstrate that in the Australian fruit fly Drosophila serrata, males assess females by using both visual and olfactory cues, resulting in a rapid plastic response (within minutes) in male cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), a display trait that is an important target of mate choice. Several CHCs in males exhibited significant IGEs, and IGEs were inducible on both males reared in the laboratory and on field-caught individuals. A vector describing genetic variance in multiple CHCs in females was found to be almost identical to a vector describing indirect genetic variance in male CHCs, suggesting that males might assess female CHCs during courtship. This vector displayed contributions from all female CHCs in the same direction and of similar magnitude, suggesting that female condition may be the underlying casual trait that males are assessing. Consistent with this interpretation, when measured directly in a separate experiment, genetic variance in female condition accounted for 19.8% of the indirect genetic variance in male CHCs. These indirect genetic effects have the potential to alter the response to selection of male sexual display traits. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract={Inbred strains of mice, such as BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6ByJ, have been used repeatedly to study genotype-phenotype relations. These strains differ on behavioral measures of fear. In novel environments, for example, BALB/c mice are substantially more neophobic than C57BL/6 animals. The benzodiazepine (BZ)/GABAA receptor system has been proposed as a regulator of behavioral responses to stress, and BALB/c and CS7BL/6 mice differ in BZ/GABAA receptor binding. In the present study, we found increased BZ receptor levels in C57BL/6 mice in the central and basolateral nuclei of the amygdala as well as the locus coeruleus using either flunitrazepam (nonselective) or zolpidem (α1 subtype selective) as radioligands. Differences in receptor binding were most pronounced in the amygdala and locus coeruleus using [3H]zolpidem, CS7BL/6 mice showed increased α1 mRNA levels in the locus coeuruleus compared to BALB/c mice. In addition, γ2 mRNA expression in BALB/c mice was decreased in the central nucleus of the amygdala to levels that were 2-2.5-fold lower than those of C57BL/6 mice. The results of an adoption study revealed that the biological offspring of C57BL/6 mothers fostered after birth to BALB/c dams showed decreased levels of γ2 mRNA expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala in comparison to peers fostered to other C57BL/6 mothers (the reverse was found for the biological offspring of BALB/c mothers). In a step-down exploration paradigm, BALB/cByJ mice crossfostered onto a C57BL/6ByJ dam expressed reduced anxiety responses. However, among C57BL/6ByJ mice, the relatively low levels of anxiety ordinarily evident were not increased when mice of this strain were reared by a BALB/cByJ dam. These preliminary findings suggest that the strain differences in the BZ/GABAA receptor system occur, at least in part, as a function of parental care. Such findings may reflect a mammalian example of an indirect genetic effect mediated by maternal care.},

abstract={The expression of most developmental or behavioral traits involves complex interactions between quantitative trait loci (QTL) from the maternal and offspring genomes. The maternal-offspring interactions play a pivotal role in shaping the direction and rate of evolution in terms of their substantial contribution to quantitative genetic (co)variation. To study the genetics and evolution of maternal-offspring interactions, a unifying statistical framework that embraces both the direct and indirect genetic effects of maternal and offspring QTL on any complex trait is developed. This model is derived for a simple backcross design within the maximum-likelihood context, implemented with the EM algorithm. Results from extensive simulations suggest that this model can provide reasonable estimation of additive and dominant effects of the QTL at different generations and their interaction effects derived from the maternal and offspring genomes. Although our model is framed to characterize the actions and interactions of maternal and offspring QTL affecting offspring traits, the idea can be readily extended to decipher the genetic machinery of maternal traits, such as maternal care. Our model provides a powerful means for studying the evolutionary significance of indirect genetic effects in any sexually reproductive organisms.},

abstract={Stocking and introduction of fishes began in Newfoundland and Labrador in the early 1880s. Introduced non-native fishes and stocking of native fishes beyond their local range have established populations in many areas. Competition, predation and the possible introduction of parasites and diseases have all resulted from such stocking and introductions. Direct genetic effects have been caused by interbreeding with native species. Indirect genetic effects may have resulted from selective forces, genetic drift and inbreeding. Aquaculture and the creation of transgenic fish also pose a new threat to native fish. The effects of introductions as mitigation or enhancement tools are discussed. Although Newfoundland and Labrador is still relatively pristine, safeguards must be introduced to reduce the potential detrimental effects of these management practices. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Mothers often provide much of the early environment for their offspring. These maternal effects are predicted to result in unusual evolutionary dynamics in offspring traits if they are themselves heritable, but these important predictions have not previously, to our knowledge, been tested in the wild. Here, we quantified the responses of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) to documented episodes of natural selection and found support for both of the fundamental predictions of models that describe maternal effect evolution. First, changes in juvenile growth rates across one generation of selection were five times greater than predicted by heritability (h2) alone, but were consistent with the additional contribution of maternal genetic effects. Second, responses to selection were influenced not only by the strength of selection in the current generation, but also by selection in the previous generation, indicating the presence of evolutionary momentum. These results were in agreement with predictions of a simple model including litter size as the only maternal effect, and provide, to our knowledge, the first empirical evidence for the importance of maternal effects to evolutionary dynamics in a natural population.},

abstract={Considering the role of indirect genetic effects in metapopulations, this chapter shows that it is important to determine how trait evolution is affected by local context, which traits contribute to local context, how trait and context are correlated ecologically and genetically, and whether variation in mean fitness leads to selection among contexts. The chapter highlights the fact that the traits affected by context may be the same or different from those traits contributing to the context, and that these may or may not be genetically correlated. Furthermore, even in the absence of among-deme selection, metapopulations permit the coevolution of phenotype and context, whereas the more traditional evolutionary genetic models do not. Finally, the chapter discusses how these considerations influence the coevolution of species in metacommunities where the presence or absence of interacting species contributes to a variation in the local context. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The past 30 years of immunological research have revealed much about the proximate mechanisms of maternal antibody transmission and utilization, but have not adequately addressed how these issues are related to evolutionary and ecological theory. Much remains to be learned about individual differences within a species in maternal antibody transmission as well as differences among species in transmission or utilization of antibodies. Similarly, maternal-effects theory has generally neglected the mechanisms by which mothers influence offspring phenotype. Although the environmental cues that generate maternal effects and the consequent effects for offspring phenotype are often well characterized, the intermediary physiological and developmental steps through which the maternal effect is transmitted are generally unknown. Integration of the proximate mechanisms of maternal antibody transmission with evolutionary theory on maternal effects affords an important opportunity to unite mechanism and process by focusing on the links between genetics, environment and physiology, with the ultimate goal of explaining differences among individuals and species in the transfer of immune function from one generation to the next.},

abstract={Recently, doubt has been cast on studies supporting good genes sexual selection by the suggestion that observed genetic benefits for offspring may be confounded by differential maternal allocation. In traditional analyses, observed genetic sire effects on offspring phenotype may result from females allocating more resources to the offspring of attractive males. However, maternal effects such as differential allocation may represent a mechanism promoting genetic sire effects, rather than an alternative to them. Here we report results from an experiment on the horned dung beetle Onthophagus taurus, in which we directly compare genetic sire effects with maternal effects that are dependent on sire phenotype. We found strong evidence that mothers provide more resources to offspring when mated with large-horned males. There were significant heritabilities for both horn length and body size, but when differential maternal effects were controlled, the observed estimates of genetic variance were greatly reduced. Our experiment provides evidence that differential maternal effects may amplify genetic effects on offspring traits that are closely related to fitness. Thus, our results may partly explain the relatively high coefficients of additive genetic variation observed in fitness-related traits and provide empirical support for the theoretical argument that maternal effects can play an important role in evolution.},

abstract={The ability of plants to sense their environment gives them the capacity to respond to it plastically. Plastic responses, in turn, frequently alter the environment that plants experience. Plants can modify the environment they experience through many mechanisms - some approximate but others quite precise. The ability of plants to modify the environment they experience can strongly influence the evolution of characters expressed subsequently. A review of some theoretical models of habitat selection and of the coevolution of characters and their environments highlights the importance of habitat selection in plants. Novel evolutionary trajectories and outcomes result when organisms are capable of modifying the environment they experience. Specifically, characters can evolve even if they have no genetic variation, and plasticity in environment-determining characters may promote specialization in others. Divergence and reproductive isolation may even be augmented by habitat-selecting behavior in plants. An understanding of basic character evolution and the evolution of plasticity in plants requires an appreciation of the ability of plants to modify the environment they experience.},

abstract={Heritabilities, commonly used to predict evolutionary potential, are notoriously low for behaviors. Apart from strong contributions of environmental variance in reducing heritabilities, the additive genetic components can be very low, especially when they are camouflaged by nonadditive genetic effects. We first report the heritabilities of courtship traits in founder-flush and control populations of the housefly (Musca domestica L.). We estimated the heritability of each male and female display through the regression of the courtships involving daughters and sons (with randomly selected mates) onto the "midparental" courtship values of their parents. Overall, the average heritability was significantly (P = .012) higher for the parent-daughter assays than for the parent-son assays. We attributed the low (even negative) heritabilities to genotype-by-environment interactions whereby the male's behavior is influenced by the "environment" of his mating partner's preferences for the display, generating epistasis through indirect genetic effects. Moreover, bottlenecked lines had up to 800% of the heritability of the controls, suggesting "conversion" of additive genetic variance from nonadditive components. Second, we used line-cross assays on separate populations that had been selected for divergence in mating behavior to identify dominance and epistasis through heterosis and outbreeding depression in courtship. Finally, our literature review confirms the prevalence of such low heritabilities (i.e., a conservative mean of 0.38) and nonadditive genetics in other behavioral repertoires (64% of the studies). We conclude that animal behavior is especially prone to the gamut of quantitative genetic complexities that can result in negative heritabilities, negative selection responses, inbreeding depression, conversion, heterosis, and outbreeding depression.},

These examples are contrasted with those instances where aquacultural activities have coexisted in harmony with underlying concerns related to issues of conservation genetics.

abstract={Although the argument over genetic influences on social dominance is contentious, genetic models of interacting phenotypes provide a theoretical framework for heritable effects on, and therefore evolution of, social behavior. Here we adapt the interacting phenotype model to show how social dominance can evolve. Our model makes a number of predictions: rapid evolution of behavior, strong correlated responses in associated traits (such as a badge of status), and, because context is important for social dominance, integrated evolution of both dominant and subordinate behavior reflecting direct and indirect genetic effects and social selection. We also describe the results of empirical work, artificial selection based on social status within a hierarchy in the cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea, that we used to test the predictions of our model. There was little change within selection lines in the expression of agonistic behavior, but by just generation 7 of selection, in comparisons between lines, high-line males consistently dominated low and control males, while low-line males were consistently subordinate to high-line and control males. There was a strong correlated response to selection in the pheromonal badge of status. Some correlated responses to selection differed among replicate lines, with the compound that makes males subordinate changed in one replicate, while the compound that confers dominance was altered in the other. Overall, our results are consistent with predictions from models of interacting phenotypes: social dominance is influenced by additive genetic variation, can evolve as a result of social selection, and evolution of social interactions appears to be rapid. Finally, different responses in the replicates allowed us to test very specific predictions regarding the role of the social pheromone in N. cinerea, highlighting the value of artificial selection experiments as a tool in evolutionary behavioral genetic studies.},

abstract={The basis of social evolution in mammals is the mother-offspring relationship. It is also the primary and most important instance of indirect genetic effects, where genetic variation in one individual affects phenotypic variation among others. This relationship is so important in mammals that often the major factor determining the life or death of newborns is the environment provided by their mother. Variations in these environments can be due to variations in maternal genotypes. In our work with the intercross of two mouse inbred strains, LG/J and SM/J, we uncovered a very severe variation in maternal performance. These females failed to nurture their offspring and showed abnormal maternal behaviors leading to loss of their litter. Rather than this being due to a single gene variant as in knockout mice, we uncovered a complex genetic basis for this trait. The effects of genes on maternal performance are entirely context dependent in our cross. They depend on the alleles present at the same or other epistatically interacting loci. Genomic locations identified in this study include locations of candidate genes whose knockouts displayed similar aberrant maternal behavior. Behaviors significantly associated with maternal performance in this study include suckling, nest building, placentophagia, pup grooming, and retrieval of pups after disturbance.},

abstract={Indirect genetic effects (IGE) of parental care performance and the direct-indirect covariance contribute substantially to total heritability in domesticated and laboratory mammals. For animals from natural populations empirical estimates of IGE are sparse. Thus, despite recent models relating IGE to evolution, evolutionary interpretations of IGE are limited. To address this deficit, we used a reciprocal cross-fostering breeding design to estimate environmental influences, direct and indirect genetic effects, and direct-indirect genetic covariances in the burying beetle Nicrophorus pustulatus to determine the evolutionary importance of IGE arising from variation in parental care performance. Carrion size positively affected adult mass and time on carrion, but had no effect on total development time. Males were slightly larger than females. For both mass and development, independent of these environmental influences, direct and indirect genetic effects were of moderate magnitude. Total genetic effects explained 36-50% of the phenotypic variance in mass and size and 27-37% of phenotypic variance in development time. Direct-indirect genetic covariances were zero or close to zero. Thus, for both mass and development time, the response to natural selection arising from environmental variation may be accelerated by the presence of IGE in N. pustulatus. The generality of this pattern and the evolutionary significance of IGE arising from parental care awaits further study of natural populations.},

abstract={While theoretical models of the evolution of parental care are based on the assumption of underlying genetic variance, surprisingly few quantitative genetic studies of this life-history trait exist. Estimation of the degree of genetic variance in parental care is important because it can be a significant source of maternal effects, which, if genetically based, represent indirect genetic effects. A major prediction of indirect genetic effect theory is that traits without heritable variation can evolve because of the heritable environmental variation that indirect genetic effects provide. In the dung beetle, Onthophagus taurus, females provide care to offspring by provisioning a brood mass. The size of the brood mass has pronounced effects on offspring phenotype. Using a half-sib breeding design we show that the weight of the brood mass females produce exhibits significant levels of additive genetic variance due to sires. However, variance caused by dams is considerably larger, demonstrating that maternal effects are also important. Body size exhibited low additive genetic variance. However, body size exerts a strong maternal influence on the weight of brood masses produced, accounting for 22% of the nongenetic variance in offspring body size. Maternal body size also influenced the number of offspring produced but there was no genetic variance for this trait. Offspring body size and brood mass weight exhibited positive genetic and phenotypic correlations. We conclude that both indirect genetic effects, via maternal care, and nongenetic maternal effects, via female size, play important roles in the evolution of phenotype in this species.},

abstract={Maternal effects are widespread and can have dramatic influences on evolutionary dynamics, but their genetic basis has been measured rarely in natural populations. We used cross-fostering techniques and a long-term study of a natural population of red squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, to estimate both direct (heritability) and indirect (maternal) influences on the potential for evolution. Juvenile growth in both body mass and size had significant amounts of genetic variation (mass h2 = 0.10; size h2 = 0.33), but experienced large, heritable maternal effects. Growth in body mass also had a large positive covariance between direct and maternal genetic effects. The consideration of these indirect genetic effects revealed a greater than three-fold increase in the potential for evolution of growth in body mass (ht2 = 0.36) relative to that predicted by heritability alone. Simple heritabilities, therefore, may severely underestimate or overestimate the potential for evolution in natural populations of animals.},

abstract={Despite a growing interest in the evolutionary aspects of maternal effects, few studies have examined the genetic consequences of maternal effects associated with parental care. To begin to provide data on nonlaboratory or nondomestic animals, we compared the effect of presence and absence of parental care on phenotype expression of larval mass and development time at different life-history stages in the burying beetle Nicrophorus pustulatus. This beetle has facultative care; parents can feed their larvae through regurgitation of digested carrion or offspring can feed by themselves from previously prepared carrion. To investigate larval responses to these two levels of care, including estimates of additive genetic effects, maternal effects, and genotype-by-environment interactions, we used a half-sibling split-family breeding experiment - raising half of the offspring of a family in the presence of their mother and the other half without their mother present. Larvae reared with their mother present were on average heavier and developed faster, although some of the differences in development decreased or were eliminated by the adult stage. These results suggest that presence or absence of post-hatching maternal care plays an important role in phenotype expression early in life, whereas later the phenotype of the offspring is determined mainly by the genotype and/or unshared environmental effects. Our study also permitted us to examine the differences in genetic effects between the two care environments. Heritabilities, maternal/common environment effect, and most genetic correlations did not differ between the care treatments. Genetic analyses revealed substantial additive genetic effects for development time but small effects for measures of body mass. Maternal plus common environment effects were high for measures of mass but low for development time, suggesting that indirect genetic effects of maternal and/or common environment are less important for the evolution of development time than for mass. Estimates of genetic correlations revealed a trade-off between the duration of the two development stages after the offspring left the carrion. There was also a negative genetic correlation between the time spent on carrion and the mass at 72 h, when mothers usually stop feeding. The analysis of genotype-by-environment interactions indicates substantial variation among maternal families in response to care. Presence or absence of parental care may therefore contribute to the additive genetic variance through its interaction with the maternal component of the additive genetic variance. The presence of this interaction further suggests that parents may vary in care strategies, with some parents dispersing after preparation of the carrion and some parents staying with the larvae. This interaction may help maintain genetic variation in growth, development time, and parental care behavior. Additional work is needed, however, to quantify indirect genetic effects and genetic variation in parental care behavior itself.},

abstract={We argue that researchers interested in language and communication problems in mental retardation or any other developmental disorder should view such problems as emerging within the broader context of the behavioral profile, or phenotype, associated with a particular genetic condition. This will require understanding the direct and indirect effects of genes on the development of language and communication and thereby an understanding of the complex relations that exist between language and other dimensions of psychological and behavioral functioning as well as an understanding of the environments in which the developing person acts and is acted upon. We believe that the dominant model for understanding language and communication problems - the nativist approach, which emphasizes the child's innate capacity for acquiring language and characterizes language as consisting of a set of context-free deterministic rules that operate on abstract representations - is inconsistent with an emphasis on indirect genetic effects. We review recent evidence that undermines the nativist approach - evidence concerning the initial state of the language-learning child, the role of environmental input, the competence-performance distinction, and modularity. In place of nativism, we argue for Emergentism, which is a model in which language is seen to emerge from the interaction between the child's biological abilities to map statistical properties of the language input into a distributed representation and the characteristics of the language learning environment and for the purpose of engaging in real-time, meaningful language use. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when the phenotype of an individual, and possibly its fitness, depends, at least in part, on the genes of its social partners. The effective result is that environmental sources of phenotypic variance can themselves evolve. Simple models have shown that IGEs can alter the rate and direction of evolution for traits involved in interactions. Here we expand the applicability of the theory of IGEs to evolution in metapopulations by including nonlinear interactions between individuals and population genetic structure. Although population subdivision alone generates some dramatic and nonintuitive evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes, the combination of nonlinear interactions with subdivision reveals an even greater importance of IGEs. The presence of genetic structure links the evolution of interacting phenotypes and the traits that influence their expression ("effector traits") even in the absence of genetic correlations. When nonlinear social effects occur in subdivided populations, evolutionary response is altered and can even oppose the direction expected due to direct selection. Because population genetic structure allows for multilevel selection, we also investigate the role of IGEs in determining the response to individual and group selection. We find that nonlinear social effects can cause interference between levels of selection even when they act in the same direction. In some cases, interference can be so extreme that the actual evolutionary response to multilevel selection is opposite in direction to that predicted by summing selection at each level. This theoretical result confirms empirical data that show higher levels of selection cannot be ignored even when selection acts in the same direction at all levels.},

abstract={Parents often have important influences on the development of traits in their offspring. One mechanism by which parents are able to influence offspring phenotype is through the level of care they provide. In onthophagine dung beetles, parents typically provision their offspring by packing dung fragments into a brood mass. Onthophagus taurus males can be separated into two discrete morphs: Large, 'major' males have head horns, whereas 'minor' males are hornless. Here we show that a switch in parental provisioning strategies adopted by males coincides with the switch in male morphology. Male provisioning results in the production of heavier brood masses than females will produce alone. However, unlike females in which the level of provisioning increases with body size in a continuous manner, the level of provisioning provided by males represents an 'all-or-none' tactic with all major males providing a fixed level of provisioning irrespective of their body size. Offspring size is determined largely by the quantity of dung provided to the developing larvae so that paternal and maternal provisioning affects the body size and horn size of offspring produced. The levels of provisioning by individual parents are significantly repeatable, suggesting paternal and maternal effects as candidate indirect genetic effects in the evolution of horn size in the genus Onthophagus.},

abstract={Theoretical analyses have demonstrated a potential role for epistasis in many of the most important processes in evolution. These analyses generally assume that an individual's genes map directly to its phenotype and epistasis results from interactions among loci that contribute to the same biochemical or developmental pathways (termed physiological, or within-genotype, epistasis). For many characters, particularly those expressed early in life, an individual's phenotype may also be affected by genes expressed by its parents. The presence of these parental effects allows for interactions between the genes present in the parental and offspring genomes. When the phenotypic effect of a locus in the offspring depends on the alleles possessed by its parents, genotype-by-genotype, or among-genotype, epistasis occurs. The among-genotype epistasis resulting from parental effects may contribute to ruggedness of adaptive landscapes because early mortality often accounts for much of the variance in fitness in populations. To demonstrate how parent-offspring interactions can result in among-genotype epistasis, I use a two-locus model, with one maternal effect locus and one direct effect locus, each with two alleles. Dynamical equations are presented for the two-locus model and are directly contrasted with the dynamical equations derived for a model for physiological epistasis. The relationship between the evolutionary dynamics resulting from these two forms of epistasis is discussed. Three scenarios are presented to illustrate systems in which maternal-offspring, genotype-by-genotype epistasis may occur. The implications of maternal-offspring epistasis for quantitative-trait-loci studies are also discussed.},

abstract={Cannibalism is widespread among many different organisms, and can have both negative and positive fitness consequences. Avoiding eating relatives can minimize negative fitness consequences of cannibalism. Such avoidance requires kin discrimination, but evidence for this ability among cannibals is limited with little data that address the cues used in such discrimination. We examined whether larvae of the ladybird beetle Harmonia axyridis avoid eating their relatives. We further manipulated environmental factors to create individuals that had similar or dissimilar rearing environments to begin to test for endogenous versus exogenous recognition cues. In our experiments, third-instar larvae were much less likely to cannibalize if they were interacting with a relative. Larvae that did cannibalize kin required more encounters, and significantly delayed cannibalism, compared to larvae cannibalizing unrelated individuals. Acquired cues were less important. Even though the different rearing environment resulted in significantly different phenotypic effects, similarity or dissimilarity of rearing environment had no effect on cannibalism, and there was no interaction between environments and relatedness in cannibalism. We suggest that H. axyridis has a well-developed kin discrimination system, and that kin recognition in this ladybird beetle is based on endogenous rather than exogenous cues. We also argue that these cues reflect either direct or indirect genetic effects on larval phenotypes.},

abstract={Social interactions often affect the fitness of interactants. Because of this, social selection has been described as a process distinct from other forms of natural selection. Social selection has been predicted to result in different evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes, including rapid or extreme evolution and evolution of altruism. Despite the critical role that social selection plays in theories of social evolution, few studies have measured the force of social selection or the conditions under which this force changes. Here we present a model of social selection acting on interacting phenotypes that can be evaluated independently from the genetics of interacting phenotypes. Our model of social selection is analogous to covariance models of other forms of selection. We observe that an opportunity for social selection exists whenever individual fitness varies as a result of interactions with conspecifics. Social selection occurs, therefore, when variation in fitness due to interactions covaries with traits, resulting in a net force of selection acting on the interacting phenotypes. Thus, there must be a covariance between the phenotypes of the interactants for social selection to exist. This interacting phenotype covariance is important because it measures the degree to which a particular trait covaries with the selective environment provided by conspecifics. A variety of factors, including nonrandom interactions, behavioral modification during interactions, relatedness, and indirect genetic effects may contribute to the covariance of interacting phenotypes, which promotes social selection. The independent force of social selection (measured as a social selection gradient) can be partitioned empirically from the force of natural selection (measured by the natural selection gradient) using partial regression. This measure can be combined with genetic models of interacting phenotypes to provide insights into social evolution.},

abstract={Genetic models of maternal effects and models of mate choice have focused on the evolutionary effects of variation in parental quality. There have been, however, few attempts to combine these into a single model for the evolution of sexually selected traits. We present a quantitative genetic model that considers how male and female parental quality (together or separately) affect the expression of a sexually selected offspring trait. We allow female choice of males based on this parentally affected trait and examine the evolution Of mate choice, parental quality and the indicator trait. Our model reveals a number of consequences of maternal and paternal effects. (I)The force of sexual selection owing to adaptive mate choice can displace parental quality from its natural selection optimum. (2) The force of sexual selection can displace female parental quality from its natural selection optimum even when nonadaptive mate choice occurs (e.g. runaway sexual selection), because females of higher parental quality produce more attractive sons and these sons counterbalance the loss in fitness owing to over-investment in each offspring. (3) Maternal and paternal effects can provide a source-of genetic variation for offspring traits, allowing evolution by sexual selection even when those traits do not show direct genetic variation (i.e. are not heritable). (4)The correlation between paternal investment and the offspring trait influenced by the parental effects can result in adaptive mate choice and lead to the elaboration of both female preference and the male sexually selected trait. When parental effects exist, sexual selection can drive the evolution of parental quality when investment increases the attractiveness of offspring, leading to the elaboration of indicator traits and higher than expected levels of parental investment.},

abstract={Parents often have important influences on their offspring's traits and/or fitness (i.e., maternal or paternal effects). When offspring fitness is determined by the joint influences of offspring and parental traits, selection may favor particular combinations that generate high offspring fitness. We show that this epistasis for fitness between the parental and offspring genotypes can result in the evolution of their joint distribution, generating genetic correlations between the parental and offspring characters. This phenomenon can be viewed as a coadaptive process in which offspring genotypes evolve to function with the parentally provided environment and, in turn, the genes for this environment become associated with specific offspring genes adapted to it. To illustrate this point, we present two scenarios in which selection on offspring alone alters the correlation between a maternal and an offspring character. We use a quantitative genetic maternal effect model combined with a simple quadratic model of fitness to examine changes in the linkage disequilibrium between the maternal and offspring genotypes. In the first scenario, stabilizing selection on a maternally affected offspring character results in a genetic correlation that is opposite in sign to the maternal effect. In the second scenario, directional selection on an offspring trait that shows a nonadditive maternal effect can result in selection for positive covariances between the traits. This form of selection also results in increased genetic variation in maternal and offspring characters, and may, in the extreme case, promote host-race formation or speciation. This model provides a possible evolutionary explanation for the ubiquity of large genetic correlations between maternal and offspring traits, and suggests that this pattern of coinheritance may reflect functional relationships between these characters (i.e., functional integration).},

abstract={In systems where individuals provide material resources to their mates or offspring, mate choice based on traits that are phenotypically correlated with the quality of resources provided is expected to be adaptive. Several models have explored the evolution of mating preference where there are direct benefits to choice, but few have addressed how a phenotypic correlation can be established between a male indicator trait and the degree of parental investment. We present a model with three quantitative traits: male and female parental investment and a potential male indicator trait. In our model, the expression of the 'indicator' trait in offspring is affected by parental investment. These effects are referred to as maternal or paternal effects, or as 'indirect genetic effects' when parental investment is heritable. With genetic variation for degree of parental investment, offspring harbor genes for parental investment that are unexpressed before mating but will affect the investment that they provide when expressed. Because the investment received from the parents affects the expression of the indicator trait, there will be a correlation between the genes for parental investment inherited and the degree of expression of the indicator trait in the offspring. The indicator trait is thus an 'honest' signal for the degree of paternal investment.},

abstract={Interacting phenotypes are traits whose expression is affected by interactions with conspecifics. Commonly-studied interacting phenotypes include aggression, courtship, and communication. More extreme examples of interacting phenotypes-traits that exist exclusively as a product of interactions-include social dominance, intraspecific competitive ability, and mating systems. We adopt a quantitative genetic approach to assess genetic influences on interacting phenotypes. We partition genetic and environmental effects so that traits in conspecifics that influence the expression of interacting phenotypes are a component of the environment. When the trait having the effect is heritable, the environmental influence arising from the interaction has a genetic basis and can be incorporated as an indirect genetic effect. However, because it has a genetic basis, this environmental component can evolve. Therefore, to consider the evolution of interacting phenotypes we simultaneously consider changes in the direct genetic contributions to a trait (as a standard quantitative genetic approach would evaluate) as well as changes in the environmental (indirect genetic) contribution to the phenotype. We then explore the ramifications of this model of inheritance on the evolution of interacting phenotypes. The relative rate of evolution in interacting phenotypes can be quite different from that predicted by a standard quantitative genetic analysis. Phenotypic evolution is greatly enhanced or inhibited depending on the nature of the direct and indirect genetic effects. Further, unlike most models of phenotypic evolution, a lack of variation in direct genetic effects does not preclude evolution if there is genetic variance in the indirect genetic contributions. The available empirical evidence regarding the evolution of behavior expressed in interactions, although limited, supports the predictions of our model.},

abstract={Efforts to mitigate severe losses to many wild stocks caused by overfishing, destruction of habitat, and blockage of migratory routes have focused on boosting artificial production in public hatcheries. Opportunities for genetic interactions between hatchery and wild fish will increase if efforts to supplement wild production with hatchery-reared fish continue. Concerns center on 1) direct genetic effects (caused by hybridization and introgression); 2) indirect genetic effects (principally due to altered selection regimes or reductions in population size caused by competition, predation, disease, or other factors); 3) genetic changes to hatchery stocks (through selection, drift, or stock transfers), which magnify the consequences of hybridization with wild fish. -from Author},

abstract={Stocking of non-native Salmoninae into North American waters began around 1870. Brown trout Salmo trutta from Europe established populations across North America and is the only successful inter-continental introduction. Introductions of native salmonids outside their native ranges have been common. Ecological effects of salmonid introductions include competition, predation on native salmonids and other fishes, environmental modification through digging of reeds in stream bottom substrates during spawning, and introduction of parasites and disease to native fish. Direct genetic effects from stocked salmonids are caused by interbreeding with native species. Indirect genetic effects may result through selective forces and/or a reduction of effective population size, genetic drift, and interbreeding. Management actions used to remote non-native salmonid populations include chemical reclamation and construction of barriers to movement. Salmonid stocking as a management practice is appropriate for species or population rehabilitation. -from Authors},

abstract={Effects of nine generations of 450r per generation of ancestral spermatogonial X irradiation of inbred rats on genetic parameters of body weight at 3, 6 and 10 weeks of age and of weight gains between these periods were studied. Covariances among relatives were estimated by mixed model and regression techniques in randomly selected lines with (R) and without (C) radiation history. Analyses of the data were based on five linear genetic models combining additive direct, additive indirect (maternal), dominance and environmental effects. Parameters in these models were estimated by generalized least-squares. A model including direct and indirect genetic effects fit more closely to the data in both R and C lines. Overdominance of induced mutations did not seem to be present. Ancestral irradiation increased maternal additive genetic variances of both weights and gains but not direct genetic variances. Theoretically, due to a negative direct-maternal genetic correlation, within full-sib family selection would be ineffective in increasing body weight at six weeks in both R and C lines. However, progress from mass selection would be expected to be faster in the R lines.},

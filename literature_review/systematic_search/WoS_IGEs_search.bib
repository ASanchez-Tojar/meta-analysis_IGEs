Abstract = {{Individuals should alter when they socially associate with conspecifics
   to avoid potentially costly interactions. Moreover, individuals may vary
   in their propensity to use information about conspecifics when making
   such social decisions. However, surprisingly little is known about
   either the determinants of or the individual variation in such ``social
   plasticity.{''} We show here that eastern water dragons (Intellegama
   lesueurii lesueurii) may simultaneously use information from different
   components of their social environment when deciding whether to socially
   associate. In particular, we found that individuals altered when they
   socially associated with conspecifics according to the levels of
   potential conflict and competition in their social environment; both
   sexes socially associated more at higher local density than would be
   expected under increased random encounters. Further, females were more
   likely to socially associate during the breeding season and when there
   were more males and/or conspecifics whom they typically avoided in their
   social environment. This suggests that females may seek safety in
   numbers when the potential for intrasexual conflict or sexual harassment
   is high. Using a behavioral reaction norm framework, we also provide
   novel evidence to show that individuals vary in the extent and direction
   of their social plasticity and that males varied more than females. Our
   study thus implies that individuals use multiple cues in their
   environment when deciding to socially associate and that the resulting
   social plasticity varies between the sexes and between individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Sow longevity is important for efficient and profitable pig
   farming. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in social
   genetic effect (SGE) of pigs on stress-tolerance and behavior. The
   present study aimed to estimate genetic correlations among average daily
   gain (ADG), stayability (STAY), and number of piglets born alive at the
   first parity (NBA1) in Korean Yorkshire pigs, using a model including
   SGE.
   Methods: The phenotypic records of ADG and reproductive traits of 33,120
   and 11,654 pigs, respectively, were evaluated. The variances and (co)
   variances of the studied traits were estimated by a multi-trait animal
   model applying the Bayesian with linear-threshold models using Gibbs
   sampling.
   Results: The direct and SGEs on ADG had a significantly negative (-0.30)
   and neutral (0.04) genetic relationship with STAY, respectively. In
   addition, the genetic correlation between the social effects on ADG and
   NBA1 tended to be positive (0.27), unlike the direct effects (-0.04).
   The genetic correlation of the total effect on ADG with that of STAY was
   negative (-0.23) but non-significant, owing to the social effect.
   Conclusion: These results suggested that total genetic effect on growth
   in the SGE model might reduce the negative effect on sow longevity
   because of the growth potential of pigs. We recommend including social
   effects as selection criteria in breeding programs to obtain
   satisfactory genetic changes in both growth and longevity.}},

Title = {{Social runaway: Fisherian elaboration (or reduction) of socially
   selected traits via indirect genetic effects}},
Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Abstract = {{Our understanding of the evolutionary stability of socially selected
   traits is dominated by sexual selection models originating with R. A.
   Fisher, in which genetic covariance arising through assortative mating
   can trigger exponential, runaway trait evolution. To examine whether
   nonreproductive, socially selected traits experience similar
   dynamics-social runaway-when assortative mating does not automatically
   generate a covariance, we modeled the evolution of socially selected
   badge and donation phenotypes incorporating indirect genetic effects
   (IGEs) arising from the social environment. We establish a social
   runaway criterion based on the interaction coefficient, psi, which
   describes social effects on badge and donation traits. Our models make
   several predictions. (1) IGEs can drive the original evolution of
   altruistic interactions that depend on receiver badges. (2) Donation
   traits are more likely to be susceptible to IGEs than badge traits. (3)
   Runaway dynamics in nonsexual, social contexts can occur in the absence
   of a genetic covariance. (4) Traits elaborated by social runaway are
   more likely to involve reciprocal, but nonsymmetrical, social
   plasticity. Models incorporating plasticity to the social environment
   via IGEs illustrate conditions favoring social runaway, describe a
   mechanism underlying the origins of costly traits, such as altruism, and
   support a fundamental role for phenotypic plasticity in rapid social
   evolution.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 4}},
Abstract = {{Socially affected traits are affected by direct genetic effects (DGE)
   and social genetic effects (SGE). DGE and SGE of an individual directly
   quantify the genetic influence of its own phenotypes and the phenotypes
   of other individuals, respectively. In the current study, a total of
   3,276 Large White pigs from different pens were used, and each pen
   contained 10 piglets. DGE and SGE were estimated for six socially
   affected traits, and then a GWAS was conducted to identify SNPs
   associated with DGE and SGE. Based on the whole-genome re-sequencing, 40
   Large White pigs were genotyped and 10,501,384 high quality SNPs were
   retained for single-locus and multi-locus GWAS. For single-locus GWAS, a
   total of 54 SNPs associated with DGE and 33 SNPs with SGE exceeded the
   threshold (P < 5.00E-07) were detected for six growth traits. Of these,
   22 SNPs with pleiotropic effects were shared by DGE and SGE. For
   multi-locus GWAS, a total of 72 and 110 putative QTNs were detected for
   DGE and SGE, respectively. Of these, 5 SNPs with pleiotropic effects
   were shared by DGE and SGE. It is noteworthy that 2 SNPs (SSC8: 16438396
   for DGE and SSC17: 9697454 for SGE) were detected in single-locus and
   multi-locus GWAS. Furthermore, 15 positional candidate genes shared by
   SGE and DGE were identified because of their roles in behaviour, health
   and disease. Identification of genetic variants and candidate genes for
   DGE and SGE for socially affected traits will provide a new insight to
   understand the genetic architecture of socially affected traits in pigs.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The environment changes constantly at various time scales and, in order
   to survive, species need to keep adapting. Whether these species succeed
   in avoiding extinction is a major evolutionary question. Using a
   multilocus evolutionary model of a mutation-limited population adapting
   under strong selection, we investigate the effects of the frequency of
   environmental fluctuations on adaptation. Our results rely on an
   ``adaptive-walk{''} approximation and use mathematical methods from
   evolutionary computation theory to investigate the interplay between
   fluctuation frequency, the similarity of environments, and the number of
   loci contributing to adaptation. First, we assume a linear additive
   fitness function, but later generalize our results to include several
   types of epistasis. We show that frequent environmental changes prevent
   populations from reaching a fitness peak, but they may also prevent the
   large fitness loss that occurs after a single environmental change.
   Thus, the population can survive, although not thrive, in a wide range
   of conditions. Furthermore, we show that in a frequently changing
   environment, the similarity of threats that a population faces affects
   the level of adaptation that it is able to achieve. We check and
   supplement our analytical results with simulations.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{559-571}},

Abstract = {{Organisms can affect one another's phenotypes when they socially
   interact. Indirect genetic effects occur when an individual's phenotype
   is affected by genes expressed in another individual. These heritable
   effects can enhance or reduce adaptive potential, thereby accelerating
   or reversing evolutionary change. Quantifying these social effects is
   therefore crucial for our understanding of evolution, yet estimates of
   indirect genetic effects in wild animals are limited to dyadic
   interactions. We estimated indirect phenotypic and genetic effects, and
   their covariance with direct effects, for the date of spring breeding in
   North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) living in an
   array of territories of varying spatial proximity. Additionally, we
   estimated indirect effects and the strength of selection at low and high
   population densities. Social effects of neighbours on the date of spring
   breeding were different from zero at high population densities but not
   at low population densities. Indirect phenotypic effects accounted for a
   larger amount of variation in the date of breeding than differences
   attributable to the among-individual variance, suggesting social
   interactions are important for determining breeding dates. The genetic
   component to these indirect effects was however not statistically
   significant. We therefore showcase a powerful and flexible method that
   will allow researchers working in organisms with a range of social
   systems to estimate indirect phenotypic and genetic effects, and
   demonstrate the degree to which social interactions can influence
   phenotypes, even in a solitary species.}},

Title = {{Models with indirect genetic effects depending on group sizes: a
   simulation study assessing the precision of the estimates of the
   dilution parameter}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{51}},
Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: In settings with social interactions, the phenotype of an
   individual is affected by the direct genetic effect (DGE) of the
   individual itself and by indirect genetic effects (IGE) of its group
   mates. In the presence of IGE, heritable variance and response to
   selection depend on size of the interaction group (group size), which
   can be modelled via a `dilution' parameter (d) that measures the
   magnitude of IGE as a function of group size. However, little is known
   about the estimability of d and the precision of its estimate. Our aim
   was to investigate how precisely d can be estimated and what determines
   this precision.
   Methods: We simulated data with different group sizes and estimated d
   using a mixed model that included IGE and d. Schemes included various
   average group sizes (4, 6, and 8), variation in group size (coefficient
   of variation (CV) ranging from 0.125 to 1.010), and three values of d
   (0, 0.5, and 1). A design in which individuals were randomly allocated
   to groups was used for all schemes and a design with two families per
   group was used for some schemes. Parameters were estimated using
   restricted maximum likelihood(REML). Bias and precision of estimates
   were used to assess their statistical quality.
   Results: The dilution parameter of IGE can be estimated for simulated
   data with variation in group size. For all schemes, the length of
   confidence intervals ranged from 0.114 to 0.927 for d, from 0.149 to
   0.198 for variance of DGE, from 0.011 to 0.086 for variance of IGE, and
   from 0.310 to 0.557 for genetic correlation between DGE and IGE. To
   estimate d, schemes with groups composed of two families performed
   slightly better than schemes with randomly composed groups.
   Conclusions: Dilution of IGE was estimable, and in general its
   estimation was more precise when CV of group size was larger. All
   estimated parameters were unbiased. Estimation of dilution of IGE allows
   the contribution of direct and indirect variance components to heritable
   variance to be quantified in relation to group size and, thus, it could
   improve prediction of the expected response to selection in environments
   with group sizes that differ from the average size.}},

Abstract = {{We generally expect traits to evolve in the same direction as selection.
   However, many organisms possess traits that appear to be costly for
   individuals, while plant and animal breeding experiments reveal that
   selection may lead to no response or even negative responses to
   selection. We formalize both of these instances as cases of ``opposite
   responses to selection.{''} Using quantitative genetic models for the
   response to selection, we outline when opposite responses to selection
   should be expected. These typically occur when social selection opposes
   direct selection, when individuals interact with others less related to
   them than a random member of the population, and if the genetic
   covariance between direct and indirect effects is negative. We discuss
   the likelihood of each of these occurring in nature and therefore
   summarize how frequent opposite responses to selection are likely to be.
   This links several evolutionary phenomena within a single framework.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental part of the quantitative genetic theory deals with the
   partitioning of the phenotypic variance into additive genetic and
   environmental components. During interaction with conspecifics, the
   interaction partner becomes a part of the environment from the
   perspective of the focal individual. If the interaction effects have a
   genetic basis, they are called indirect genetic effects (IGEs) and can
   evolve along with direct genetic effects. Sexual reproduction is a
   classic context where potential conflict between males and females can
   arise from trade-offs between current and future investments. We studied
   five female fecundity traits, egg length and number, egg pod length and
   number and latency to first egg pod, and estimated the direct and IGEs
   using a half-sib breeding design in the grasshopper Chorthippus
   biguttulus. We found that the male IGEs were an order of magnitude lower
   than the direct genetic effects and were not significantly different
   from zero. However, there was some indication that IGEs were larger
   shortly after mating, consistent with the idea that IGEs fade with time
   after interaction. Female direct heritabilities were moderate to low.
   Simulation shows that the variance component estimates can appear larger
   with less data, calling for care when interpreting variance components
   estimated with low power. Our results illustrate that the contribution
   of male IGEs is overall low on the phenotypic variance of female
   fecundity traits. Thus, even in the relevant context of sexual conflict,
   the influence of male IGEs on the evolutionary trajectory of female
   reproductive traits is likely to be small.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment is expected to have substantial effects on
   behavior, and as a consequence, its heritability and evolvability. We
   investigated these effects by exposing Australian field crickets
   (Teleogryllus oceanicus) to either silence or recordings of male
   acoustic sexual signals. We used a combined pedigree and
   full-sib/half-sib breeding design to estimate the repeatability,
   heritability, and evolvability of behaviors related to boldness,
   exploration, and activity. All behaviors measured were significantly
   repeatable in both social environments. Additionally, most behaviors
   showed significant heritabilities in the two environments. We found no
   difference in repeatabilities between the silent and the acoustic
   environment but did find significant differences in the heritabilities
   and evolvabilities between these environments. There was a high degree
   of similarity between the phenotypic covariance matrices across the two
   environments, while the genotypic covariance matrices were highly
   dissimilar. Reflecting this, we found significant
   genotype-by-environment interactions for most of the behaviors. Lastly,
   we found that the repeatable aspect of behavior ({''}personality{''})
   was significantly heritable for most behaviors, but that these
   heritabilities were higher in the acoustic than in the silent
   environment. We conclude that the social environment can have a
   significant impact on the heritability and evolvability of behavior, and
   argue that evolutionary inferences from phenotypic studies should be
   made with caution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a critical analysis of genetically informed research
   on relationships, with an emphasis on relationships among unrelated
   individuals (e.g., spouses). To date, research in this area has used
   traditional behavioral genetic frameworks to either partition the
   variance in relationship-related outcomes into genetic and environmental
   components, or to examine gene-environment interplay between
   relationship factors and other outcomes. However, this conventional
   approach is at odds with the long-standing understanding from the field
   of relationship science that both partners' characteristics matter when
   predicting shared outcomesthat is, outcomes that are emergent. We
   examine briefly the philosophical concept of emergence, and discuss ways
   to model dyadic outcomes in genetically informed relationships research.
   We also review the related topic of social genetic effects, which refer
   to the influence of a social partner's genotype on a proband's
   phenotype. A genetically informed dyadic perspective has potentially
   important consequences for our understanding of the pathways from
   genotypeshared or individual-level phenotypes, and more fully recognizes
   the complexity of how genetic and social/environmental factors come
   together to influence human behavior.}},

Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Cold tolerance plays a critical role in determining the geographical
   range limits of species. Previous studies have found that range shifts
   in response to climate warming are facilitated, paradoxically, by cold
   acclimation capacities, due to increasingly colder and variable weather
   at high latitudes. However, the evolutionary dynamics of this process
   are poorly understood. In this study we combined experiments and field
   studies to investigate the social and ecological factors affecting cold
   tolerances in range-shifting populations of the female-polymorphic
   damselfly Ischnura elegans in north-east Scotland, and their
   consequences for evolutionary change. In the field, we observed both
   environmental and social effects on cold tolerance and female colour
   morph frequencies. This process results in a latitudinal cline in female
   morph frequencies, due to positive feedback between social stress and
   thermal tolerances. Density manipulations in the laboratory provide
   experimental evidence that social interactions directly impact cold
   tolerance. Reciprocal effects of social environments on thermal
   acclimation may be important but commonly overlooked aspects of allee
   effects that contribute to the formation of range margins. Moreover,
   there is a wider need to consider the role of evolving social dynamics
   to reciprocally shape both the thermal physiology of individuals and the
   thermal niches of species.}},

   the degree of interaction between mates: an implementation in pigs
   growth rate}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{An alternative implementation of the animal model including indirect
   genetic effect (IGE) is presented considering pair-mate-specific
   interaction degrees to improve the performance of the model. Data
   consisted of average daily gain (ADG) records from 663 pigs kept in
   groups of 10 to 14 mates during the fattening period. Three types of
   models were used to fit ADG data: (i) animal model (AM); (ii) AM with
   classical IGE (AM-IGE); and (iii) AM fitting IGE with a specific degree
   of interaction between each pair of mates (AM-IGE(i)). Several feeding
   behavior phenotypes were used to define the pair-mate-specific degree of
   interaction in AM-IGE(i): feeding rate (g/min), feeding frequency
   (min/day), the time between consecutive visits to the feeder (min/day),
   occupation time (min/day) and an index considering all these variables.
   All models included systematic effects batch, initial age (covariate),
   final age (covariate), number of pigs per pen (covariate), plus the
   random effect of the pen. Estimated posterior mean (posterior SD) of
   heritability was 0.47 (0.15) using AM. Including social genetic effects
   in the model, total heritable variance expressed as a proportion of
   total phenotypic variance (T-2) was 0.54 (0.29) using AM-IGE, whereas it
   ranged from 0.51 to 0.55 (0.12 to 0.14) with AM-IGE(i), depending on the
   behavior trait used to define social interactions. These results confirm
   the contribution of IGEs to the total heritable variation of ADG.
   Moreover, important differences between models were observed in EBV
   rankings. The percentage of coincidence of top 10\% animals between AM
   and AM-IGE(i) ranged from 0.44 to 0.89 and from 0.41to 0.68 between
   AM-IGE and AM-IGE(i). Based on the goodness of fit and predictive
   ability, social models are preferred for the genetic evaluation of ADG.
   Among models including IGEs, when the pair-specific degree of
   interaction was defined using feeding behavior phenotypes we obtained an
   increase in the accuracy of genetic parameters estimates, the better
   goodness of fit and higher predictive ability. We conclude that feeding
   behavior variables can be used to measure the interaction between pen
   mates and to improve the performance of models including IGEs.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions can give rise to indirect genetic effects (IGEs),
   which occur when genes expressed in one individual affect the phenotype
   of another individual. The evolutionary dynamics of traits can be
   altered when there are IGEs. Sex often involves indirect effects arising
   from first-order (current) or second-order (prior) social interactions,
   yet IGEs are infrequently quantified for reproductive behaviors. Here,
   we use experimental populations of burying beetles that have experienced
   bidirectional selection on mating rate to test for social plasticity and
   IGEs associated with focal males mating with a female either without
   (first-order effect) or with (second-order effect) prior exposure to a
   competitor, and resource defense behavior (first-order effect). Additive
   IGEs were detected for mating rate arising from (first-order)
   interactions with females. For resource defense behavior, a standard
   variance partitioning analysis provided no evidence of additive genetic
   varianceeither direct or indirect. However, behavior was predicted by
   focal size relative to that of the competitor, and size is also
   heritable. Assuming that behavior is causally dependent on relative
   size, this implies that both DGEs and IGEs do occur (and may potentially
   interact). The relative contribution of IGEs may differ among social
   behaviors related to mating which has consequences for the evolutionary

Abstract = {{In 2017, The American Naturalist celebrated its 150th anniversary. It
   was founded as a journal of natural history, yet it developed into an
   important vehicle of the evolutionary synthesis. During the early years
   of the journal and through much of the twentieth century, evolutionary
   theory was developed to explain the history of nature before humankind
   existed to alter it-when time was expansive and uncommon events, though
   rare, were frequent enough to effect evolutionary change. Today, with
   the influence of human activity, dispersal patterns are fundamentally
   altered, genetic variation is locally limiting in small and fragmented
   populations, and environments are changing so rapidly that time itself
   seems limited. How can we use this theory, which was built to explain
   the past and which depends on an excess of chances and time, to address
   the challenges of the present and the future when chances are fewer and
   time seems so short? And does the habit of naturalists to observe,
   describe, and cultivate a fascination with nature have a place in
   contemporary science?}},

Abstract = {{Social immunity moderates the spread of pathogens in social groups and
   is especially likely in groups structured by genetic relatedness. The
   extent to which specific immune pathways are used is unknown. Here, we
   investigate the expression and social role of three functionally
   separate immune genes (pgrp-sc2, thaumatin, and defensin) during
   parental care in the beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. These genes reside
   in different immune pathways, allowing us to test whether specific
   components of the immune system are targeted for social immunity. To
   test for the evolution of specificity, we manipulated the influence of
   social context and timing on gene expression and quantified the
   covariance of maternal immune gene expression and offspring fitness.
   Larvae reduced expression of all three genes in the presence of parents.
   Parental pgrp-sc2 and thaumatin increased during direct parenting, while
   defensin was upregulated before larvae arrived. Parental expression of
   pgrp-sc2 and thaumatin responded similarly to experimental manipulation
   of timing and presence of larvae, which differed from the response of
   defensin. We found a positive covariance between maternal expression and
   offspring fitness for pgrp-sc2 and thaumatin but not defensin. We
   suggest that social immunity can involve specific genes and pathways,
   reflecting evolution as an interacting phenotype during parenting.}},

Pages = {{4-14}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{There are many situations in nature where we expect traits to evolve but
   not necessarily for mean fitness to increase. However, these scenarios
   are hard to reconcile simultaneously with Fisher's fundamental theorem
   of natural selection (FTNS) and the Price identity (PI). The
   consideration of indirect genetic effects (IGEs) on fitness reconciles
   these fundamental theorems with the observation that traits sometimes
   evolve without any adaptation by explicitly considering the correlated
   evolution of the social environment, which is a form of transmission
   bias. Although environmental change is often assumed to be absent when
   using the PI, here we show that explicitly considering IGEs as change in
   the social environment with implications for fitness has several
   benefits: (1) it makes clear how traits can evolve while mean fitness
   remains stationary, (2) it reconciles the FTNS with the evolution of
   maladaptation, (3) it explicitly includes density-dependent fitness
   through negative social effects that depend on the number of interacting
   conspecifics, and (4) it allows mean fitness to evolve even when direct
   genetic variance in fitness is zero, if related individuals interact
   and/or if there is multilevel selection. In summary, considering fitness
   in the context of IGEs aligns important theorems of natural selection
   with many situations observed in nature and provides a useful lens
   through which we might better understand evolution and adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Parental care is found widely across animal taxa and is manifest in a
   range of behaviours from basic provisioning in cockroaches to highly
   complex behaviours seen in mammals. The evolution of parental care is
   viewed as the outcome of an evolutionary cost/benefit trade-off between
   investing in current and future offspring, leading to the selection of
   traits in offspring that influence parental behaviour. Thus, level and
   quality of parental care are affected by both parental and offspring
   genetic differences that directly and indirectly influence parental care
   behaviour. While significant research effort has gone into understanding
   how parental genomes affect parental, and mostly maternal, behaviour,
   few studies have investigated how offspring genomes affect parental
   care. In this review, we bring together recent findings across different
   fields focussing on the mechanism and genetics of offspring effects on
   maternal care in mammals.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A growing body of empirical work supports and informs the role of
   genetic variation and contemporary evolution in shaping ecological
   dynamics at the population, community and ecosystem levels. Although
   much progress has been made, I contend that reliance on several common
   empirical and inferential approaches is limiting forward progress in key
   areas, which leads me to several suggestions. More studies should focus
   on revealing eco-evolutionary dynamics as they play out in the ``real
   world,{''} as opposed to laboratories and mesocosms. At the community
   and ecosystem levels, increasing effort should be directed towards the
   importance of evolution acting through population density, as opposed to
   only direct per-capita effects. More work should be directed towards the
   effects of whole-community evolution, as opposed to the evolution of
   only particular focal species. New and innovative approaches are needed
   for studying how natural selection resists evolutionary and ecological
   change, thus generating cryptic eco-evolutionary dynamics. Although
   simultaneous improvement on all of these fronts is perhaps impossible
   for any single research programme, even advances in one or more areas
   could dramatically improve our understanding of the prevalence, power
   and relevance of eco-evolutionary dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs; the heritable influence of one organism
   on a conspecific) can affect the evolutionary dynamics of complex
   traits, including behavior. Voluntary wheel running is an important
   model system in quantitative genetic studies of behavior, but the
   possibility of IGEs on wheel running and its components (time spent
   running and average running speed) has not been examined. Here, we
   analyze a dataset from a replicated selection experiment on wheel
   running (11,420 control and 26,575 selected mice measured over 78
   generations) in which the standard measurement protocol allowed for the
   possibility of IGEs occurring through odors because mice were provided
   with clean cages attached to a clean wheel or a wheel previously
   occupied by another mouse for 6days. Overall, mice ran less on
   previously occupied wheels than on clean wheels, and they ran
   significantly less when following a male than a female. Significant
   interactions indicated that the reduction in running was more pronounced
   for females than males and for mice from selected lines than control
   mice. Pedigree-based animal model analyses revealed significant IGEs for
   running distance (the trait under selection), with effect sizes
   considerably higher for the initial/exploratory phase (i.e., first two
   of six test days). Our results demonstrate that IGEs can occur in mice
   interacting through scent only, possibly because they attempt to avoid
   conspecifics.}},

Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{Both reciprocity and positive assortment (like with like) are predicted
   to promote the evolution of cooperation, yet how partners influence each
   other's behaviour within dynamic networks is not well understood. One
   way to test this question is to partition phenotypic variation into
   differences among individuals in the expression of cooperative behaviour
   (the `direct effect'), and plasticity within individuals in response to
   the social environment (the `indirect effect'). A positive correlation
   between these two sources of variation, such that more cooperative
   individuals elicit others to cooperate, is predicted to facilitate
   social contagion and selection on cooperative behaviour. Testing this
   hypothesis is challenging, however, because it requires repeated
   measures of behaviour across a dynamic social landscape. Here, we use an
   automated data-logging system to quantify the behaviour of 179
   wire-tailed manakins, birds that form cooperative male-male coalitions,
   and we use multiple-membership models to test the hypothesis that
   dynamic network partnerships shape within-individual variation in
   cooperative behaviour. Our results show strong positive correlations
   between a bird's own sociality and his estimated effect on his partners,
   consistent with the hypothesis that cooperation begets cooperation.
   These findings support the hypothesis that social contagion can
   facilitate selection for cooperative behaviour within social networks.}},

   if susceptibility to scale herbivory influenced the diversity and
   composition of the extended community of 250+ arthropod species, and if
   this influence would be consistent across consecutive years, an extreme
   drought year followed by a moderate drought year. Because scale insects
   alter the architecture of susceptible trees, it is difficult to separate
   the direct influences of susceptibility on arthropod communities from
   the indirect influences of scale-altered tree architecture. To separate
   these influences, scales were experimentally excluded from susceptible
   trees for 15 years creating susceptible trees with the architecture of
   resistant trees, hereafter referred to as scale-excluded trees. Five
   patterns emerged. (1) In both years, arthropod abundance was 3-4X lower
   on susceptible trees compared to resistant and scale-excluded trees. (2)
   Species accumulation curves show that alpha and gamma diversity were
   2-3X lower on susceptible trees compared to resistant and scale-excluded
   trees. (3) Reaction norms of arthropod richness and abundance on
   individual tree genotypes across years showed genotypic variation in the
   community response to changes in climate. (4) The genetic-based
   influence of susceptibility on arthropod community composition is
   climate dependent. During extreme drought, community composition on
   scale-excluded trees resembled susceptible trees indicating composition
   was strongly influenced by tree genetics independent of tree
   architecture. However, under moderate drought, community composition on
   scale-excluded trees resembled resistant trees indicating traits
   associated with tree architecture became more important. (5) One year
   after extreme drought, the arthropod community rebounded sharply.
   However, there was a much greater rebound in richness and abundance on
   resistant compared to susceptible trees suggesting that reduced
   resiliency in the arthropod community is associated with susceptibility.
   These results argue that individual genetic-based plant-herbivore
   interactions can directly and indirectly impact community-level
   diversity, which is modulated by climate. Understanding such
   interactions is important for assessing the impacts of climate change on
   biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{When individuals interact, their phenotypes may be affected not only by
   their own genes but also by genes in their social partners. This
   phenomenon is known as Indirect Genetic Effects (IGEs). In aquaculture
   species and some plants, however, competition not only affects trait
   levels of individuals, but also inflates variability of trait values
   among individuals. In the field of quantitative genetics, the
   variability of trait values has been studied as a quantitative trait in
   itself, and is often referred to as inherited variability. Such studies,
   however, consider only the genetic effect of the focal individual on
   trait variability and do not make a connection to competition. Although
   the observed phenotypic relationship between competition and variability
   suggests an underlying genetic relationship, the current quantitative
   genetic models of IGE and inherited variability do not allow for such a
   relationship. The lack of quantitative genetic models that connect IGEs
   to inherited variability limits our understanding of the potential of
   variability to respond to selection, both in nature and agriculture.
   Models of trait levels, for example, show that IGEs may considerably
   change heritable variation in trait values. Currently, we lack the tools
   to investigate whether this result extends to variability of trait
   values. Here we present a model that integrates IGEs and inherited
   variability. In this model, the target phenotype, say growth rate, is a
   function of the genetic and environmental effects of the focal
   individual and of the difference in trait value between the social
   partner and the focal individual, multiplied by a regression
   coefficient. The regression coefficient is a genetic trait, which is a
   measure of cooperation; a negative value indicates competition, a
   positive value cooperation, and an increasing value due to selection
   indicates the evolution of cooperation. In contrast to the existing
   quantitative genetic models, our model allows for co-evolution of IGEs
   and variability, as the regression coefficient can respond to selection.
   Our simulations show that the model results in increased variability of
   body weight with increasing competition. When competition decreases,
   i.e., cooperation evolves, variability becomes significantly smaller.
   Hence, our model facilitates quantitative genetic studies on the
   relationship between IGEs and inherited variability. Moreover, our
   findings suggest that we may have been overlooking an entire level of
   genetic variation in variability, the one due to IGEs.}},

   Effects of Maternal Inbreeding on Offspring}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{The severity of inbreeding depression often varies across environments
   and recent work suggests that social interactions can aggravate or
   reduce inbreeding depression. For example, stressful interactions such
   as competition can exacerbate inbreeding depression, whereas benign
   interactions such as parental care can buffer against inbreeding
   depression in offspring. Here, we test whether male assistance in
   parental care can buffer against the detrimental effects of maternal
   inbreeding on offspring fitness in the burying beetle Nicrophorus
   vespilloides. Our results confirm that maternal inbreeding had
   detrimental effects on offspring survival. However, we found no evidence
   that male assistance in parental care buffered against those effects on
   offspring fitness. Outbred females benefitted from male assistance,
   gaining more weight over the breeding attempt when assisted by a male.
   In contrast, inbred females did not benefit from male assistance,
   gaining as much weight regardless of whether they were assisted by a
   male or not. Surprisingly, we find that males gained more weight during
   the breeding attempt when mated to an inbred female, suggesting that
   males benefitted from assisting an inbred female partner in terms of
   their weight gain. Overall, our findings suggest that parental care or
   other benign social interactions may not always buffer against
   detrimental effects of inbreeding depression.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Mating between closely related individuals is often associated with
   fitness declines. However, less is known about consequences of
   inbreeding for (sexual) chemical signaling traits and formate choice and
   acceptance. Thus, we investigated effects of inbreeding on the chemical
   phenotype, i.e., the profile and diversity of putative cuticular
   hydrocarbons (CHCs) in the leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae Fabricius.
   Moreover, we tested mating probabilities in no choice bioassays with
   different combinations of outbred and inbred beetles. Finally, we tested
   male preferences and female aggression in a dual choice bioassay with
   one outbred male, one outbred, and one inbred female. The chemical
   phenotype was altered in inbred females, which showed a male-like CHC
   profile. In no choice bioassays, inbred individuals had a decreased
   mating probability than outbred individuals. Changes in the chemical
   phenotype of inbred females might be involved in the negative inbreeding
   effects on mating acceptance. When having the choice, males did not show
   any preference between outbred and inbred females. However, inbred
   females were more aggressive in these situations, potentially to raise
   their chances to be mated, because due to inbreeding depression they
   have lower reproductive perspectives than outbred females. Overall,
   inbreeding effects on the chemical phenotype, mating acceptance and
   female aggression might have consequences for the population dynamics
   and development of the individuals. In conclusion, these results suggest
   that inbreeding events have the potential to affect sexual selection of
   chemical signaling traits and evolutionary processes underlying mating
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of aggression depends not only on the direct genetic
   effects (DGEs) of an individual's genes on its own behavior, but also on
   indirect genetic effects (IGEs) caused by heritable phenotypes expressed
   by social partners. IGEs can affect the amount of heritable variance on
   which selection can act. Despite the important roles of IGEs in the
   evolutionary process, it remains largely unknown whether the strength of
   IGEs varies across life stages or competitive regimes. Based on
   manipulations of nymphal densities and > 3000 pair-wise aggression tests
   across multiple life stages, we experimentally demonstrate that IGEs on
   aggression are stronger in field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus) that
   develop at lower densities than in those that develop at higher
   densities, and that these effects persist with age. The existence of
   density-dependent IGEs implies that social interactions strongly
   determine the plastic expression of aggression when competition for
   resources is relaxed. A more competitive (higher density) rearing
   environment may fail to provide crickets with sufficient resources to
   develop social cognition required for strong IGEs. The contribution of
   IGEs to evolutionary responses was greater at lower densities. Our study
   thereby demonstrates the importance of considering IGEs in
   density-dependent ecological and evolutionary processes.}},

Abstract = {{Pregnancy-associated glycoproteins (PAG) are secreted by the trophoblast
   and are detectable in maternal circulation around the time of attachment
   of the fetal placenta, as well as in blood and milk throughout
   gestation. The understanding of the genetic mechanisms controlling PAG
   levels can confer advantages for livestock breeding programs given the
   precocity and the ease of obtaining this phenotype from routine
   pregnancy diagnosis. The aim of this study was to characterize PAG
   levels by estimating genetic parameters and correlations with other
   dairy traits, and to identify genomic regions and candidate genes
   associated with PAG levels in milk. The PAG data consisted of pregnancy
   diagnoses using commercial assays from 2012 to 2017, and genotype data
   consisted of 54,123 SNP markers for 2,352 individuals (embryos and
   dams). The model included contemporary group (herd, year, and season)
   and embryo age as fixed effects, and random embryonic (direct) and
   maternal (indirect) genetic effects. Using genomic data, the estimated
   heritability for direct and maternal genetic effects (+/- standard
   deviations) were 0.23 +/- 0.05 and 0.11 +/- 0.05, respectively. The
   genetic correlation between these effects was almost zero (0.001 +/-
   0.06). A preliminary analysis revealed low correlations between milk PAG
   levels and other dairy traits. The genome-wide association analysis was
   performed using 2 approaches: single-marker and single-step using all
   markers. Four genomic regions with direct genetic effects were detected
   on Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 6, BTA7, BTA19, and BTA29 of the embryonic
   genome. The BTA29 locus was within the bovine PAG gene cluster,
   suggesting a cis-regulatory quantitative trait locus on the PAG
   expression. However, other associations, without an obvious link to PAG
   expression, could be related to the transportation of PAG and their
   concentration in milk. Only 1 region from the maternal genome, on BTA4,
   had a significant indirect effect, where WNT2 is a candidate gene
   related to placenta vascularization and gestation health. Collectively,
   our results suggest a moderate genetic control of milk PAG levels from
   both maternal and fetal genomes, but larger studies are needed to fully
   evaluate the usefulness of milk PAG in the genetic evaluation of fetal
   growth and cow fertility.}},

Abstract = {{1. For this study a cohort of melanic Harmonia axyridis males homozygous
   for the spectabilis allele was produced. These were used to produce four
   kinds of twice-mated females, comprising all four permutations of
   melanic and non-melanic (succinic) males. A series of 12 larvae were
   then reared from the first and 10th clutches of each female to compare
   progeny developmental phenotypes. 2. There were no effects of mating
   treatment on overall female reproductive performance (preoviposition
   period, 20-day fecundity, or egg fertility). 3. Age-specific maternal
   effects were evident in progeny developmental phenotypes; larvae of 10th
   clutches developed more slowly, pupation was shorter, and adults emerged
   at heavier weights. 4. Paternal effects were superimposed on maternal
   effects and affected progeny independent of their paternity; melanic
   males induced slower larval development and slower pupation, but only in
   10th clutches and only when they mated second. 5. There was a
   significant three-way interaction between male mating treatment, clutch
   number and progeny phenotype, indicating that progeny developmental
   responses to (mixed) paternal effects varied depending on their own
   phenotype and the time elapsed since their mother's last mating. 6.
   Melanic males mating second obtained a P2 advantage over succinic males,
   which increased from first to 10th clutch, but the reverse was not true
   when succinic males mated second. Thus, polyandry in H. axyridis
   facilitates both genetic and epigenetic competition among males while
   simultaneously enabling the sharing of predominant paternal effects
   among the progeny of different fathers.}},

Abstract = {{Social isolation has profound impacts. Most animal research focuses on
   negative phenotypic consequences of social isolation within individual
   lifetimes. Less is known about how it affects genetics, selection, and
   evolution over longer timescales, though ample indirect evidence
   suggests that it might. We advocate that evolutionary consequences of
   social isolation be tested more directly. We suggest that the `index of
   social isolation', the mismatch between actual and optimal social
   interaction experienced by individuals within a population, may play a
   key role in releasing cryptic genetic variation, adaptation rates,
   diversification patterns, and ecosystem-level processes. Evolutionary
   dynamics arising from social isolation could have significant impacts in
   applied settings such as conservation, animal breeding, control of
   biological invasions, and evolutionary resilience to anthropogenic

Title = {{Linking the fine-scale social environment to mating decisions: a future
   direction for the study of extra-pair paternity}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1558-1577}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Variation in extra-pair paternity (EPP) among individuals of the same
   population could result from stochastic demography or from individual
   differences in mating strategies. Although the adaptive value of EPP has
   been widely studied, much less is known about the characteristics of the
   social environment that drive the observed patterns of EPP. Here, we
   demonstrate how concepts and well-developed tools for the study of
   social behaviour (such as social network analysis) can enhance the study
   of extra-pair mating decisions (focussing in particular on avian mating
   systems). We present several hypotheses that describe how
   characteristics of the social environment in which individuals are
   embedded might influence the levels of EPP in a socially monogamous
   population. We use a multi-level social approach (Hinde, 1976) to
   achieve a detailed description of the social structure and social
   dynamics of individuals in a group. We propose that the pair-bond, the
   direct (local) social environment and the indirect (extended) social
   environment, can contribute in different ways to the variation observed
   in the patterns of EPP, at both the individual and the population level.
   A strength of this approach is that it integrates into the analysis
   (indirect) interactions with all potential mates in a population, thus
   extending the current framework to study extra-pair mating behaviour. We
   also encourage the application of social network methods such as
   temporal dynamic analysis to depict temporal changes in the patterns of
   interactions among individuals in a group, and to study how this affects
   mating behaviour. We argue that this new framework will contribute to a
   better understanding of the proximate mechanisms that drive variation in
   EPP within populations in socially monogamous species, and might
   ultimately provide insights into the evolution and maintenance of mating
   systems.}},

Title = {{The genetic architecture of socially-affected traits: a GWAS for direct
   and indirect genetic effects on survival time in laying hens showing
   cannibalism}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{50}},
Month = {{JUL 23}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cannibalism is an important welfare problem in the layer
   industry. Cannibalism is a social behavior where individual survival is
   affected by direct genetic effects (DGE) and indirect genetic effects
   (IGE). Previous studies analysed repeated binomial survival, instead of
   survival time, which improved accuracies of breeding value predictions.
   Our study aimed at identifying SNPs associated with DGE and IGE for
   survival time, and comparing results from models that analyse survival
   time and repeated binomial survival.
   Methods: Survival data of three layer crosses (W1{*}WA, W1{*}WB, and
   W1{*}WC) were used. Each individual had one survival time record and 13
   monthly survival (0/1) records. Approximately 30,000 single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs) were included in the genome-wide association study
   (GWAS), using a linear mixed model for survival time, a linear mixed
   model and a generalized linear mixed model for repeated binomial
   survival (0/1). Backwards elimination was used to determine phenotypic
   and genetic variance explained by SNPs.
   Results: The same quantitative trait loci were identified with all
   models. A SNP associated with DGE was found in cross W1{*}WA, with an
   allele substitution effect of 22 days. This SNP explained 3\% of the
   phenotypic variance, and 36\% of the total genetic variance. Four SNPs
   associated with DGE were found in cross W1{*}WB, with effects ranging
   from 16 to 35 days. These SNPs explained 1 to 6\% of the phenotypic
   variance and 9 to 44\% of the total genetic variance. Our results
   suggest a link of DGE and IGE for survival time in layers with the
   gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system, since a SNP located near a gene
   for a GABA receptor was associated with DGE and with IGE (not
   significant).
   Conclusions: This is one of the first large studies investigating the
   genetic architecture of a socially-affected trait. The power to detect
   SNP associations was relatively low and thus we expect that many effects
   on DGE and IGE remained undetected. Yet, GWAS results revealed SNPs with
   large DGE and a link of DGE and IGE for survival time in layers with the
   GABAergic system, which supports existing evidence for the involvement
   of GABA in the development of abnormal behaviors.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{251-260}},

Abstract = {{Inbreeding and genetic drift can decrease genetic heterozygosity, and
   this low heterozygosity can depress fitness, resulting in
   heterozygosity-fitness correlations (HFCs). HFCs are typically small in
   magnitude, a result often attributed to power of the analyses. Animal
   behaviors often affect fitness and are often heritable to some degree.
   We hypothesized that heterozygosity influences behavior, which, in turn,
   potentially influences fitness. Specifically, in red-backed salamanders,
   Plethodon cinereus, which have limited dispersal and the potential for
   inbreeding, we tested whether heterozygosity, as estimated from six
   microsatellite loci, affected home range size, juvenile growth, and
   survival. We found that salamanders with higher heterozygosity had
   larger home ranges and grew faster, which is indicative of reproductive
   success. However, we found no effects of heterozygosity on survival. We
   conclude that, because activity in P. cinereus is tightly linked to food
   uptake and mass gain, heterozygosity influences growth via effects on
   foraging behavior. Future research should investigate how the
   relationship between heterozygosity, behavior, and fitness may be
   affected or mediated by endocrine or immune systems.}},

Abstract = {{There is mounting evidence that inbreeding can have complex effects on
   social interactions among inbred and outbred individuals. Here, we
   investigate effects of offspring and maternal inbreeding on
   parent-offspring communication in the burying beetle Nicrophorus
   vespilloides. We find effects of the interaction between offspring and
   maternal inbreeding on maternal behavior. Outbred females provided more
   direct care toward inbred larvae, while inbred females provided similar
   levels of direct care toward inbred and outbred larvae. Furthermore, we
   find direct and indirect effects of offspring inbreeding on offspring
   begging and maternal behavior, respectively. Inbred larvae spent less
   time begging than outbred larvae, and (outbred) females provided more
   direct care and less indirect care toward inbred larvae. Finally, we
   find effects of the interaction between offspring and maternal
   inbreeding on larval body mass. Inbred and outbred offspring grew to a
   similar size when the female was outbred, while inbred offspring were of
   a smaller size when the female was inbred. Our results suggest that
   outbred females provided more care toward inbred offspring to compensate
   for their poor genetic quality. Our study advances our understanding of
   inbreeding by showing that inbreeding can have direct effects on the
   behavior of inbred individuals and indirect effects on the behavior of
   outbred individuals and that indirect effects on outbred individuals may
   in turn influence the fitness of inbred individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection generally involves males evolving secondary sexual
   characters that satisfy the mating preferences of females. Behavioral
   ecologists have spent considerable research effort on identifying how
   variation in sexually-selected traits in insects is maintained among
   males at the expense of investigating the proximate and ultimate causes
   of variation in female mating preferences for those male traits. The
   past decade has witnessed improved effort in redressing this bias in
   insects with researchers identifying a host of factors intrinsic and
   extrinsic to the female as mediating flexibility in female mating
   behavior. Evidence is mounting that a female's social environment,
   whether experienced during development or as an adult, is key to shaping
   her mating preferences. Others have extended these observations to show
   that the genetic identity of the conspecific individuals comprising the
   social environment can have profound effects on female mating
   preferences via indirect genetic effects (IGEs), or through
   interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGEs) if the genotype of
   heterospecifics influences plasticity in mating preferences.
   Considerably more work is needed to not only expand our list of
   mediating intrinsic and extrinsic factors but also to identify how their
   interaction influences individual variation in male and female mating
   preferences.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Understanding micro-evolutionary responses of mating systems to
   contemporary selection requires estimating sex-specific additive genetic
   variances and cross-sex genetic covariances in key reproductive strategy
   traits. One key trait comprises the occurrence of divorce versus mate
   fidelity across sequential reproductive attempts. If divorce represents
   an evolving behavioural strategy that responds to selection it must have
   non-zero individual repeatability and heritability, but quantitative
   estimates from wild populations are scarce. We used 39 years of
   individual breeding records and pedigree data from free-living song
   sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to quantify sex-specific permanent
   individual and additive genetic variances, and hence estimate
   repeatability and heritability, in liability for divorce. We estimated
   moderate repeatability among females, but little repeatability among
   males. Estimates of additive genetic variance were small in both sexes,
   and the cross-sex genetic covariance was close to zero. Consequently,
   the total heritability was small but likely non-zero, indicating low
   potential for micro-evolutionary response to selection. Rapid
   micro-evolutionary change of divorce rate, therefore, appears unlikely,
   even if there were substantial fitness benefits of divorce and resulting
   selection.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: The genetic effects of an individual on the phenotypes of its
   social partners, such as its pen mates, are known as social genetic
   effects. This study aims to identify the candidate genes for social
   (pen-mates') average daily gain (ADG) in pigs by using the genome-wide
   association approach.
   Methods: Social ADG (sADG) was the average ADG of unrelated pen-mates
   (strangers). We used the phenotype data (16,802 records) after
   correcting for batch (week), sex, pen, number of strangers (1 to 7 pigs)
   in the pen, full-sib rate (0\% to 80\%) within pen, and age at the end
   of the test. A total of 1,041 pigs from Landrace breeds were genotyped
   using the Illumina PorcineSNP60 v2 BeadChip panel, which comprised
   61,565 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. After quality
   control, 909 individuals and 39,837 markers remained for sADG in
   genome-wide association study.
   Results: We detected five new SNPs, all on chromosome 6, which have not
   been associated with social ADG or other growth traits to date. One SNP
   was inside the prostaglandin F2 alpha receptor (PTGFR) gene, another SNP
   was located 22 kb upstream of gene interferon-induced protein 44
   (IFI44), and the last three SNPs were between 161 kb and 191 kb upstream
   of the EGF latrophilin and seven transmembrane domain-containing protein
   1 (ELTD1) gene. PTGFR, IFI44, and ELTD1 were never associated with
   social interaction and social genetic effects in any of the previous
   studies.
   Conclusion: The identification of several genomic regions, and candidate
   genes associated with social genetic effects reported here, could
   contribute to a better understanding of the genetic basis of interaction
   traits for ADG. In conclusion, we suggest that the PTGFR, IFI44, and
   ELTD1 may be used as a molecular marker for sADG, although their
   functional effect was not defined yet. Thus, it will be of interest to
   execute association studies in those genes.}},

Volume = {{285}},

Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{Inbreeding depression plays a significant role in evolutionary biology
   and ecology. However, we lack a dear understanding of the fitness
   consequences of inbreeding depression. Studies often focus on short-term
   effects of inbreeding in juvenile offspring, whereas inbreeding
   depression in adult traits and the interplay between inbreeding
   depression and age are rarely addressed. Inbreeding depression may
   increase with age and accelerate the decline in reproductive output in
   ageing individuals (reproductive senescence), which could be subject to
   sex-specific dynamics. We test this hypothesis with a longitudinal
   experimental study in a short-lived songbird. Adult inbred and outbred
   male and female canaries were paired in a 2 x 2 factorial design, and
   survival and annual reproductive performance were studied for 3 years.
   We found inbreeding depression in female egg-laying ability, male
   fertilization success and survival of both sexes. Annual reproductive
   success of both males and females declined when paired with an inbred
   partner independent of their own inbreeding status. This shows that
   inbreeding can have fitness costs in outbred individuals when they mate
   with an inbred individual. Further, inbred females showed faster
   reproductive senescence than outbred females, confirming that inbreeding
   depression and age can interact to affect fitness. By contrast, there
   was no evidence for an interaction between inbreeding depression and
   reproductive senescence in male fertilization success. Our findings
   highlight the importance of considering sex-specific effects and age to
   determine the full range of fitness consequences of inbreeding and
   demonstrate that inbreeding depression can accelerate reproductive
   senescence.}},

Title = {{Longitudinal analysis of direct and indirect effects on average daily
   gain in rabbits using a structured antedependence model}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{50}},
Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Indirect genetic effects (IGE) are important components of
   various traits in several species Although the intensity of social
   interactions between partners likely vary over time, very few genetic
   studies have investigated how IGE vary over time for traits under
   selection in livestock species To overcome this issue, our aim was (1)
   to analyze longitudinal records of average daily gain (ADG) in rabbits
   subjected to a 5-week period of feed restriction using a structured
   antedependence (SAD) model that includes IGE and (2) to evaluate, by
   simulation, the response to selection when IGE are present and genetic
   evaluation is based on a SAD model that includes IGE or not.
   Results: The direct genetic variance for ADG (g/d) increased from week 1
   to 3 {[}from 8.03 to 13.47 (g/d)(2)] and then decreased {[}6.20 (g/d)(2)
   at week 5], while the indirect genetic variance decreased from week 1 to
   4 {[}from 0.43 to 0.22 (g/d)(2)] The correlation between the direct
   genetic effects of different weeks was moderate to high (ranging from
   0.46 to 0.86) and tended to decrease with time interval between
   measurements The same trend was observed for IGE for weeks 2 to 5
   (correlations ranging from 0.62 to 0.91) Estimates of the correlation
   between IGE of week 1 and IGE of the other weeks did not follow the same
   pattern and correlations were lower Estimates of correlations between
   direct and indirect effects were negative at all times After seven
   generations of simulated selection, the increase in ADG I from selection
   on EBV from a SAD model that included IGE was higher (similar to 30\%)
   than when those effects were omitted.
   Conclusions: Indirect genetic effects are larger just after mixing
   animals at weaning than later in the fattening I period, probably
   because of the establishment of social hierarchy that is generally
   observed at that time Accounting for IGE in the selection criterion
   maximizes genetic progress.}},

Abstract = {{Theory on indirect genetic effects (IGEs) indicates that variation in
   the genetic composition of social groups can generate GxG epistasis that
   may promote the evolution of stable polymorphisms. Using a livebearing
   fish with a genetic polymorphism in coloration and associated behavioral
   differences, we tested whether genotypes of social partners interacted
   with focal individual genotypes to influence growth and condition over
   16 weeks of development. We found that IGEs had a significant influence
   on patterns of feeding, regardless of focal fish genotype. There was no
   influence of social environment on juvenile length, but there was
   significant GxG epistasis for body condition. Each focal juvenile was in
   better condition when its own genotype was not present in adult social
   partners. These data are consistent with negative frequency-dependent
   selection in which each morph performs better when it is rare. Neither
   variation in feeding nor activity-related behaviors explained variation
   in body condition, suggesting that GxG epistasis for condition was
   caused by physiological differences between the two genotypes. These
   findings indicate that GxG epistasis in a given polymorphism can
   generate fitness landscapes that contribute to the maintenance of that
   polymorphism and to maintenance of genetic variation for additional
   fitness-related traits.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual reproduction is inherently interactive, especially in animal
   species such as humans that exhibit extended pair bonding. Yet we have
   little knowledge of the role of male characteristics and their
   evolutionary impact on reproductive behavioural phenotypes, to the
   extent that biologists typically consider component traits (e.g.
   reproductive timing) as female-specific. Based on extensive genealogical
   data detailing the life histories of 6435 human mothers born across four
   centuries of modern history, we use an animal modelling approach to
   estimate the indirect genetic effect of men on the reproductive
   phenotype of their partners. These analyses show that a woman's
   reproductive timing (age at first birth) is influenced by her partner's
   genotype. This indirect genetic effect is positively correlated with the
   direct genetic effect expressed in women, such that total heritable
   variance in this trait is doubled when heritable partner effects are
   considered. Our study thus suggests that much of the heritable variation
   in women's reproductive timing is mediated via partner effects, and that
   the evolutionary potential of this trait is far greater than previously
   appreciated.}},

Abstract = {{The environment can have a considerable impact on behaviour. The social
   environment is predicted to be a particularly important driver of
   behavioural variation and evolution through the indirect genetic effects
   that arise whenever individuals interact with conspecifics. We used male
   Australian field crickets, Teleogryllus oceanicus, to examine the
   effects of changes in the social environment (recorded acoustic sexual
   signals of other males) on the expression and consistency of boldness,
   activity and exploration, and their between-individual covariation.
   Switching from a silent environment to being exposed to male acoustic
   sexual signals resulted in crickets becoming less bold, active and
   explorative. Switching from an acoustic to a silent environment resulted
   in increased boldness and activity. We also looked at the effects of
   changes in the nonsocial environment via a physical disturbance that
   mimicked the presence of a potential predator (mechanical shaking). The
   effects of physical disturbance (and changes thereof) on behaviour were
   far less pronounced than the effects of changes in the social
   environment. Neither the repeatability of nor correlations between
   behaviours were affected by changes in physical disturbance. Only the
   average level of exploration was affected significantly when crickets
   were moved from an undisturbed to a disturbed environment, with crickets
   becoming less explorative. Although changes in the social and the
   nonsocial environment affected the repeatability of and correlations
   between some of the behaviours measured, changes in the social
   environment had the greater effect. We discuss the ecological and
   evolutionary implications of our findings and how they relate to our
   current understanding of social and nonsocial environmental effects on
   behaviour. (c) 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{This study investigates the complex roles of the social environment and
   genes in the multigenerational transmission of educational attainment.
   Drawing on genome-wide data and educational attainment measures from the
   Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),
   I conduct polygenic score analyses to examine genetic confounding in the
   estimation of parents' and grandparents' influences on their children's
   and grandchildren's educational attainment. I also examine social
   genetic effects (i.e., genetic effects that operate through the social
   environment) in the transmission of educational attainment across three
   generations. Two-generation analyses produce three important findings.
   First, about one-fifth of the parent-child association in education
   reflects genetic inheritance. Second, up to half of the association
   between parents' polygenic scores and children's education is mediated
   by parents' education. Third, about one-third of the association between
   children's polygenic scores and their educational attainment is
   attributable to parents' genotypes and education. Three-generation
   analyses suggest that genetic confounding on the estimate of the direct
   effect of grandparents' education on grandchildren's education (net of
   parents' education) may be inconsequential, and I find no evidence that
   grandparents' genotypes significantly influence grandchildren's
   education through non-biological pathways. The three-generation results
   are suggestive, and the results may change when different samples are
   used.}},

Abstract = {{What was once expensive and revolutionary full-genome sequenceis now
   affordable and routine. Costs will continue to drop, opening up new
   frontiers in behavioral genetics. This shift in costs from the genome to
   the phenome is most notable in large clinical studies of behavior and
   associated diseases in cohorts that exceed hundreds of thousands of
   subjects. Examples include the Women's Health Initiative (www.whl.org),
   the Million Veterans Program (www.research.va.gov/MVP), the 100000
   Genomes Project (genomicsengland.co.uk) and commercial efforts such as
   those by deCode (www.decode.com) and 23 and me (www.23andme.com). The
   same transition is happening in experimental neuro- and behavioral
   genetics, and sample sizes of many hundreds of cases are becoming
   routine (www.genenetwork.org, www.mousephenotyping.org). There are two
   major consequences of this new affordability of massive omics datasets:
   (1) it is now far more practical to explore genetic modulation of
   behavioral differences and the key role of gene-by-environment
   interactions. Researchers are already doing the hard part the
   quantitative analysis of behavior. Adding the omics component can
   provide powerful links to molecules, cells, circuits and even better
   treatment. (2) There is an acute need to highlight and train behavioral
   scientists in how best to exploit new omics approaches. This review
   addresses this second issue and highlights several new trends and
   opportunities that will be of interest to experts in animal and human
   behaviors.}},

Title = {{Pervasive indirect genetic effects on behavioral development in
   polymorphic eastern mosquitofish}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{289-300}},
Month = {{MAR-APR}},
Abstract = {{``Nurture{''} depends on the ``nature{''} of social partners. The
   behavior of a young male mosquitofish depends on genetic differences in
   his social partners and on his own genes. Social partners that are
   genetically dark or light colored affect the behavior differently. But,
   dark-colored males respond less to social differences than light males,
   and receive different behaviors from social partners. So, even
   apparently innate differences related to color can be caused by
   differences in the behavior of social partners.The social environment
   can dramatically influence the development and expression of individual
   behavior. Indirect genetic effects (IGE) arise when variation in the
   social environment depends on genotypic differences among social
   partners. Their role in generating variation and influencing
   evolutionary dynamics has become increasingly recognized in recent
   years, but less attention has been paid to how IGE arise during
   development. We measured the development of IGE using a discrete natural
   polymorphism in male coloration and associated behaviors in eastern
   mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). We observed substantial IGE and
   direct genetic effects on behavior. For some behaviors, IGE changed and
   even reversed direction over the 16 weeks of the experiment, indicating
   important developmental dynamics. Interaction between IGE and direct
   genetic effects for some behaviors suggests that melanistic males were
   less responsive to a genetic change in their social environment than
   nonmelanistic males were. Alternately, social partners might vary less
   in the behavior they direct toward melanistic males. Color morphs
   differed in mating behavior and in aggressive behavior they received
   from social partners, but not in direct measures of aggression.
   Therefore, even apparently innate differences in behavior between morphs
   could arise as indirect effects of differences in behavior directed
   toward them by social partners. These results indicate that some
   differences attributed to melanism in this and other species might
   result from color morphs experiencing different social environments.
   Deducing the developmental and social origins of these indirect effects
   is therefore critical for understanding melanism-associated behavioral
   variation in the many species in which it occurs.}},

Abstract = {{In genetic association studies, it is important to distinguish direct
   and indirect genetic effects in order to build truly functional models.
   For this purpose, we consider a directed acyclic graph setting with
   genetic variants, primary and intermediate phenotypes, and confounding
   factors. In order to make valid statistical inference on direct genetic
   effects on the primary phenotype, it is necessary to consider all
   potential effects in the graph, and we propose to use the estimating
   equations method with robust Huber-White sandwich standard errors. We
   evaluate the proposed causal inference based on estimating equations
   (CIEE) method and compare it with traditional multiple regression
   methods, the structural equation modeling method, and sequential
   G-estimation methods through a simulation study for the analysis of
   (completely observed) quantitative traits and time-to-event traits
   subject to censoring as primary phenotypes. The results show that CIEE
   provides valid estimators and inference by successfully removing the
   effect of intermediate phenotypes from the primary phenotype and is
   robust against measured and unmeasured confounding of the indirect
   effect through observed factors. All other methods except the sequential
   G-estimation method for quantitative traits fail in some scenarios where
   their test statistics yield inflated type I errors. In the analysis of
   the Genetic Analysis Workshop 19 dataset, we estimate and test genetic
   effects on blood pressure accounting for intermediate gene expression
   phenotypes. The results show that CIEE can identify genetic variants
   that would be missed by traditional regression analyses. CIEE is
   computationally fast, widely applicable to different fields, and
   available as an R package.}},

Title = {{Social genetic effects for growth in pigs differ between boars and gilts}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{50}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Average daily gain (ADG) in pigs is affected by the
   so-called social (or indirect) genetic effects (SGE). However, SGE may
   differ between sexes because boars grow faster than gilts and their
   social behaviours differ. We hypothesized that direct genetic effects
   (DGE) and SGE for ADG in pigs differ between boars and gilts and that
   accounting for these differences will improve the predictive ability of
   a social genetic effects model (SGM). Our data consisted of ADG from 30
   to 94 kg for 32,212 uncastrated males (boars) and 48,252 gilts that were
   raised in sex-specific pens. Data were analyzed using a univariate model
   with sex as a fixed effect and a bivariate model with ADG in boars and
   gilts as separate traits using both a classical animal model (CM) and a
   SGM.
   Results: With the univariate model, the heritability for ADG was 0.22
   +/- 0.01 for the CM, while the estimate of the total heritable variance
   (T-2) was 0.23 +/- 0.01 with the SGM. With the bivariate model, the
   genetic variance for SGE was higher for boars (13.8 +/- 5.8) than for
   gilts (9.3 +/- 3.9). For the bivariate model, T-2 was 0.32 +/- 0.02 for
   boars and 0.27 +/- 0.01 for gilts. Estimates of the genetic correlations
   between DGE (0.88 +/- 0.02) and SGE (0.30 +/- 0.30) for boars versus
   gilts indicated that ADG in boars and gilts are different traits.
   Moreover, the estimate of the genetic correlation between DGE and SGE
   indicated presence of genetic effects of competition among gilts but not
   among boars. Compared to a CM, the univariate SGM improved predictive
   ability significantly only for gilts and the bivariate SGM improved
   predictive ability significantly for both boars and gilts.
   Conclusions: We found significant genetic variances of SGE for ADG. The
   covariance between DGE and SGE was much more negative for gilts than for
   boars when applying the bivariate model. Because the estimate of the
   genetic correlation for ADG between gilts and boars differed
   significantly from 1 and the predictive ability for boars and gilts was
   improved significantly with the bivariate model, we recommend the use of
   a bivariate model to estimate both SGE and DGE for ADG in pigs.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation in resident species can influence the assembly and
   dynamics of communities, but the potential for these genetic effects to
   persist across generations is largely unresolved. In principle,
   persistent, directional changes in communities are only predicted when
   community properties covary genetically with the fitness of resident
   species.
   Estimates of genetic covariance between the fitness of a resident
   species and its community are therefore necessary to ``close the
   eco-evolutionary loop{''} in studies of community genetics, but such
   estimates are rare. Emulating community genetics experiments in plants,
   we used clonal replicates of 21 genotypes of a resident species (the
   encrusting bryozoan, Hippopodina) to investigate the magnitude of
   genotypic variance contributing to assembly of a marine benthic
   community.
   Genotypes explained up to 35\% of variation in community assembly.
   Critically, the performance of Hippopodina genotypes covaried both with
   the evenness of communities and with the abundances of some individual
   species, representing an indirect genetic effect that creates the
   potential for multigenerational interactions between Hippopodina and
   co-existing species. Our results suggest that different genotypes will
   associate with different community members consistently across
   generations, and such non-random associations can give rise to
   specialization. Further interactions between species other than
   Hippopodina itself may also be altered by effects of genetic variation
   in the focal species.
   Furthermore, species in the community other than Hippopodina itself will
   interact more commonly in the presence of some genotypes over others.
   Our results support the potential for genetic variation in one species
   to have deterministic effects on the dynamics of ecological communities.}},

Abstract = {{Organisms express phenotypic plasticity during social interactions.
   Interacting phenotype theory has explored the consequences of social
   plasticity for evolution, but it is unclear how this theory applies to
   complex social structures. We adapt interacting phenotype models to
   general social structures to explore how the number of social
   connections between individuals and preference for phenotypically
   similar social partners affect phenotypic variation and evolution. We
   derive an analytical model that ignores phenotypic feedback and use
   simulations to test the predictions of this model. We find that adapting
   previous models to more general social structures does not alter their
   general conclusions but generates insights into the effect of social
   plasticity and social structure on the maintenance of phenotypic
   variation and evolution. Contribution of indirect genetic effects to
   phenotypic variance is highest when interactions occur at intermediate
   densities and decrease at higher densities, when individuals approach
   interacting with all group members, homogenizing the social environment
   across individuals. However, evolutionary response to selection tends to
   increase at greater network densities as the effects of an individual's
   genes are amplified through increasing effects on other group members.
   Preferential associations among similar individuals (homophily) increase
   both phenotypic variance within groups and evolutionary response to
   selection. Our results represent a first step in relating social network
   structure to the expression of social plasticity and evolutionary
   responses to selection.}},

Title = {{Heterospecific Nest Site Copying Behavior in a Wild Bird: Assessing the
   Influence of Genetics and Past Experience on a Joint Breeding Phenotype}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 30}},
Abstract = {{Breeding site selection is often a joint decision of pair members in
   species with biparental care and the experience of both pair members may
   influence the use of information for site selection. Nevertheless,
   quantitative genetics of joint information use for site selection
   remains unexplored so far. We used an experimental approach to quantify
   the relative importance of genetics (heritability) and past experience
   (age, familiarity with the environment, previous breeding success,
   previous information use) in heterospecific social information use for
   nest site selection in wild collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis).
   Flycatchers collect social information from resident tits for nest site
   selection. We created an apparent preference of tits for a novel nest
   site feature and recorded choices of flycatchers (copying or rejecting
   the tit preference). Copying behavior was stronger for naive individuals
   but also differed between years, which could be explained by contrasting
   seasonality in the demonstrator species. Past experience as reflected by
   age affected subsequent use of social information: pairs with a yearling
   male were more likely to copy the heterospecific preference than pairs
   with older immigrant males. There was no general pattern in successive
   individual choices over the years. Accordingly, individual repeatability
   in copying tit preference was very low. At the pair level, we estimated
   sex-specific direct and indirect genetic effects on the joint nest site
   decision and found no sex-specific heritability and no cross-sex genetic
   correlation. Our results confirm the importance of past experience for
   social information use and suggest that social information use is highly
   plastic and most likely not genetically inherited in collared
   flycatchers. Whether individuals use social information should be
   related to environmentally-induced changes in the quality of information
   and thus be context-dependent. Selection may therefore act on the
   ability to optimally use social information in varying environments and
   on the processes underlying such adjustment, such as learning, rather
   than the use of information itself.}},

   Whether this sorting of like with like arises from historical patterns

   research has evaluated the possibility that unobserved genotypes may
   play an important role in the creation of homophilous relationships. We
   extend this work by using data from 5,500 adolescents from the National
   Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to examine
   genetic similarities among pairs of friends. Although there is some
   evidence that friends have correlated genotypes, both at the
   whole-genome level as well as at trait-associated loci (via polygenic
   scores), further analysis suggests that meso-level forces, such as
   school assignment, are a principal source of genetic similarity between
   friends. We also observe apparent socialgenetic effects in which
   polygenic scores of an individual's friends and schoolmates predict the
   individual's own educational attainment. In contrast, an individual's
   height is unassociated with the height genetics of peers.}},

   Animal Kingdom. Here, we propose that both challenges can benefit from
   studying how indirect genetic effects (IGEs: the effects of genes
   expressed in one individual on traits in another individual) shape
   behavioral phenotypes. We provide a sketch of the theoretical framework
   that grounds IGEs in behavioral ecology research and focus on recent
   advances made from studies of IGEs in areas of behavioral ecology such
   as sexual selection, sexual conflict, social dominance, and
   parent-offspring interactions. There is mounting evidence that IGEs have
   important influences on behavioral phenotypes associated with these
   processes, such as sexual signals and preferences and behaviors which
   function to manipulate interacting partners. IGEs can also influence
   both responses to selection and selection itself, and considering IGEs
   refines evolutionary predictions and provides new perspectives on the
   origins of seemingly perplexing behavioral traits. A key unresolved
   question, but one that has dominated the behavioral sciences for over a
   century, is whether behavior is more likely than other types of traits
   to contribute to evolutionary change and diversification. We advocate
   taking advantage of an IGE approach to outline falsifiable hypotheses
   and a general methodology to rigorously test this frequently proposed,
   yet still contentious, special role of behavior in evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Competition for resources including food, physical space, and potential
   mates is a fundamental ecological process shaping variation in
   individual phenotype and fitness. The evolution of competitive ability,
   in particular social dominance, depends on genetic (co)variation among
   traits causal (e.g., behavior) or consequent (e.g., growth) to
   competitive outcomes. If dominance is heritable, it will generate both
   direct and indirect genetic effects (IGE) on resource-dependent traits.
   The latter are expected to impose evolutionary constraint because
   winners necessarily gain resources at the expense of losers. We varied
   competition in a population of sheepshead swordtails, Xiphophorus
   birchmanni, to investigate effects on behavior, size, growth, and
   survival. We then applied quantitative genetic analyses to determine (i)
   whether competition leads to phenotypic and/or genetic integration of
   behavior with life history and (ii) the potential for IGE to constrain
   life history evolution. Size, growth, and survival were reduced at high
   competition. Male dominance was repeatable and dominant individuals show
   higher growth and survival. Additive genetic contributions to phenotypic
   covariance were significant, with the G matrix largely recapitulating
   phenotypic relationships. Social dominance has a low but significant
   heritability and is strongly genetically correlated with size and
   growth. Assuming causal dependence of growth on dominance, hidden IGE
   will therefore reduce evolutionary potential.}},

Title = {{An evolutionary framework outlining the integration of individual social

Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{1. Behaviour is the interface between an organism and its environment,
   and behavioural plasticity is important for organisms to cope with
   environmental change. Social behaviour is particularly important because
   sociality is a dynamic process, where environmental variation influences
   group dynamics and social plasticity can mediate resource acquisition.
   Heterogeneity in the ecological environment can therefore influence the
   social environment. The combination of the ecological and social
   environments may be interpreted collectively as the socioecological
   environment, which could explain variation in fitness.
   2. Our objective was to outline a framework through which individual
   social and spatial phenotypes can be integrated and interpreted as
   phenotypes that covary as a function of changes in the socioecological
   environment. We propose the socioecological environment is composed of
   individual behavioural traits, including sociality and habitat
   selection, both of which are repeatable, potentially heritable and may
   reflect animal personality traits. We also highlight how ecological and
   social niche theory can be applied to the socioecological environment
   framework, where individuals occupy different socioecological niches.
   Individual sociality and habitat selection are also density-dependent,
   and theory predicts that density-dependent traits should affect
   reproduction, survival, and therefore fitness and population dynamics.
   3. We then illustrate the proximate links between sociality, habitat
   selection and fitness as well as the ultimate, and possibly adaptive,
   consequences associated with changes in population density. The
   ecological, evolutionary and applied implications of our proposed
   socioecological environment framework are broad and changes in density
   could influence individual fitness and population dynamics. For
   instance, human-induced environmental changes can influence population
   density, which can affect the distribution of social and spatial
   phenotypes within a population. In summary, we outline a conceptual
   framework that incorporates individual social and spatial behavioural
   traits with fitness and we highlight a range of ecological and
   evolutionary processes that are likely associated with the
   socioecological environment.}},

Journal = {{GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Female post-mating behaviors are regulated by complex factors involving
   males, females, and the environment. In insects, plant secondary
   compounds that males actively forage for, may indirectly modify female
   behaviors by altering male behavior and physiology. In the tephritid
   fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni, females mated with males previously fed on
   plant-derived phenylpropanoids (= ``lures{''} based on usage in
   tephritid literature), have longer mating refractoriness, greater
   fecundity, and reduced longevity than females mated with non-lure fed
   males. This system thus provides a model for studying transcriptional
   changes associated with those post-mating behaviors, as the genes
   regulating the phenotypic changes are likely to be expressed at a
   greater magnitude than in control females. We performed comparative
   transcriptome analyses using virgin B. tryoni females, females mated
   with control males (control-mated), and females mated with lure-fed
   males (lure-mated). We found 331 differentially expressed genes (DEGs)
   in control-mated females and 80 additional DEGs in lure-mated females.
   Although DEGs in control-mated females are mostly immune response genes
   and chorion proteins, as reported in Drosophila species, DEGs in
   lure-mated females are titin-like muscle proteins, histones, sperm, and
   testis expressed proteins which have not been previously reported. While
   transcripts regulating mating (e.g., lingerer) did not show differential
   expression in either of the mated female classes, the odorant binding
   protein Obp56a was down-regulated. The exclusively enriched or
   suppressed genes in lure-mated females, novel transcripts such as titin
   and histones, and several taxa-specific transcripts reported here can
   shed more light on post-mating transcriptional changes, and this can
   help understand factors possibly regulating female post-mating
   behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{There is growing evidence for consistent among-individual variation in
   individual sociability (e.g., tendency to be sociable) in a number of
   species. However, sexes often differ in their social behaviors, as well
   as the selection pressures which they experience. This may translate
   into differences in repeatability of sociability, although this has not
   yet been tested. Here, we investigated whether eastern water dragons
   (Intellegama leseurii) exhibited evidence of consistent among-individual
   variation (i.e., repeatability) in 4 different measurements of
   sociability. Specifically, we measured sociability in 4 ways (degree,
   centrality, proportion of time spent being social, and number of
   preferences), and tested whether there was evidence for sex differences
   in the repeatability of these sociability measurements, or whether
   observed levels of repeatability could be explained by a stable social
   environment. Our findings provide new evidence for sex differences in
   social personality: we found that males were significantly repeatable in
   3 of 4 sociability measurements (degree, centrality, and proportion of
   time spent being social), whereas females were not. Further, we found
   that these differences were not a result of differences in the dynamics
   of the social environment. We discuss our findings in the context of
   sexual selection, as well as sex differences in the evolutionary drivers
   of social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) describe the effect of the genes of

   indirect genetic effects using the coefficient of interaction () to test
   whether evolved between Drosophila melanogaster and D.simulans. We
   compare for locomotion between ethanol and nonethanol environments in
   both species, but only D.melanogaster utilizes ethanol ecologically. We
   find that while sexual dimorphism for locomotion has been reversed in
   D.simulans, there has been no evolution of social effects between these
   two species. What did evolve was the interaction between
   genotype-specific and the environment, as D.melanogastervaries
   unpredictably between environments and D.simulansdoes not. In this
   system, this suggests evolutionary lability of sexual dimorphism but a
   conservation of social effects, which brings forth interesting questions
   about the role of the social environment in sexual selection.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment is both an important agent of selection for most
   organisms, and an emergent property of their interactions. As an
   aggregation of interactions among members of a population, the social
   environment is a product of many sets of relationships and so can be
   represented as a network or matrix. Social network analysis in animals
   has focused on why these networks possess the structure they do, and
   whether individuals' network traits, representing some aspect of their
   social phenotype, relate to their fitness. Meanwhile, quantitative
   geneticists have demonstrated that traits expressed in a social context
   can depend on the phenotypes and genotypes of interacting partners,
   leading to influences of the social environment on the traits and
   fitness of individuals and the evolutionary trajectories of populations.
   Therefore, both fields are investigating similar topics, yet have
   arrived at these points relatively independently. We review how these
   approaches are diverged, and yet how they retain clear parallelism and
   so strong potential for complementarity. This demonstrates that, despite
   separate bodies of theory, advances in one might inform the other.
   Techniques in network analysis for quantifying social phenotypes, and
   for identifying community structure, should be useful for those studying
   the relationship between individual behaviour and group-level
   phenotypes. Entering social association matrices into quantitative
   genetic models may also reduce bias in heritability estimates, and allow
   the estimation of the influence of social connectedness on trait
   expression. Current methods for measuring natural selection in a social
   context explicitly account for the fact that a trait is not necessarily
   the property of a single individual, something the network approaches
   have not yet considered when relating network metrics to individual
   fitness. Harnessing evolutionary models that consider traits affected by
   genes in other individuals (i.e. indirect genetic effects) provides the
   potential to understand how entire networks of social interactions in
   populations influence phenotypes and predict how these traits may
   evolve. By theoretical integration of social network analysis and
   quantitative genetics, we hope to identify areas of compatibility and
   incompatibility and to direct research efforts towards the most
   promising areas. Continuing this synthesis could provide important
   insights into the evolution of traits expressed in a social context and
   the evolutionary consequences of complex and nuanced social phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding of trait evolution is built upon studies that examine
   the correlation between traits and fitness, most of which implicitly
   assume all individuals experience similar selective environments.
   However, accounting for differences in selective pressures, such as
   variation in the social environment, can advance our understanding of
   how selection shapes individual traits and subsequent fitness. In this
   study, we test whether variation in the social environment affects
   selection on individual phenotype. We apply a new sexual network
   framework to quantify each male's social environment as the mean body
   size of his primary competitors. We test for direct and social selection
   on male body size using a 10-year data set on black-throated blue
   warblers (Setophaga caerulescens), a territorial species for which body
   size is hypothesized to mediate competition for mates. We found that
   direct selection on body size was weak and nonsignificant, as was social
   selection via the body size of the males' competitors. Analysing both
   types of selection simultaneously allows us to firmly reject a role for
   body size in competitive interactions between males and subsequent male
   fitness in this population. We evaluate the application of the sexual
   network approach to empirical data and suggest that other phenotypic
   traits such as song characteristics and plumage may be more relevant
   than body size for male-male competition in this small passerine bird.}},

Title = {{Familiarity with neighbours affects intrusion risk in territorial red
   squirrels}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{11-20}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Interactions with conspecifics are an important aspect of an
   individual's environment. Although it is well known that the presence of
   conspecifics can have important effects on behaviour, in general it is
   also now acknowledged that the composition of the social environment can
   vary, and that this variation may have profound effects on individual
   behaviour and fitness. Using a wild population of North American red
   squirrels, Tamiasciurus hudsonicus, we investigated the importance of
   the composition of the social environment in a territorial species by
   assessing whether the risk of intrusion faced by territory owners varied
   with the degree of relatedness and familiarity in their social
   neighbourhoods. To test this, we conducted temporary removals of
   territory owners and observed the time until intrusion and the identity
   of intruding individuals. We found that individuals in neighbourhoods
   with low average familiarity faced a higher risk of intrusion and that
   unfamiliar neighbours were more likely to intrude. Surprisingly, we
   found that related neighbours also posed a higher risk of intrusion. The
   results from our study suggest that familiarity with neighbours may be
   an ecologically and evolutionarily relevant measure of the social
   environment, even in a species considered to be `asocial'. Future
   studies should consider the potential importance of the social
   environment, which has heretofore been mostly overlooked, as a relevant
   selective pressure in asocial, territorial species. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{A central problem in evolutionary biology is to determine whether and
   how social interactions contribute to natural selection. A key method
   for phenotypic data is social selection analysis, in which fitness
   effects from social partners contribute to selection only when there is
   a correlation between the traits of individuals and their social
   partners (nonrandom phenotypic assortment). However, there are
   inconsistencies in the use of social selection that center around the
   measurement of phenotypic assortment. Here, we use data analysis and
   simulations to resolve these inconsistencies, showing that: (i) not all
   measures of assortment are suitable for social selection analysis; and
   (ii) the interpretation of assortment, and how to detect nonrandom
   assortment, will depend on the scale at which it is measured. We discuss
   links to kin selection theory and provide a practical guide for the
   social selection approach.}},

Volume = {{284}},

Abstract = {{Family members show behavioural strategies predicted to maximize
   individual fitness. These behaviours depend directly on genes expressed
   in focal individuals but also indirectly on genes expressed in other
   family members. However, how sibling and parental behavioural strategies
   are modified by genes expressed in family members, and to what degree,
   remains unclear. To answer this question, we have used a split litter
   design in an experimental population of genetically variable mouse
   families, and identified loci that indirectly affected sibling and
   maternal behaviour simultaneously. These loci map to genomic regions
   that also show a direct effect on offspring behaviour. Directly and
   indirectly affected traits were significantly correlated at the
   phenotypic level, illustrating how indirect effects are caused. Genetic
   variants in offspring that influence solicitation also impacted their
   siblings' and maternal behaviour. However, in contrast to predictions
   from sibling competition, unrelated litter mates benefited from
   increased solicitation. Overall, such indirect genetic effects explained
   a large proportion of variation seen in behaviours, with candidate genes
   involved in metabolism to neuronal development. These results reveal
   that we need to view behavioural strategies as the result of conjoint
   selection on genetic variation in all interacting family members.}},

Abstract = {{One of the triumphs of evolutionary biology is the discovery of robust
   mechanisms that promote the evolution of cooperative behaviors even when
   cooperation reduces the fertility or survival of cooperators. These
   mechanisms include, kin selection, reciprocity, and direct benefits to
   cooperation that are often nonlinear. Though they have been extensively
   studied separately, investigating the joint action of these mechanisms
   has been more difficult. Moreover, how these mechanisms shape variation
   in cooperation is not well known. Such variation is crucial for
   understanding the evolution of behavioral syndromes and animal
   personality. Here, I use the tools of kin selection and evolutionary
   game theory to build a framework that integrates these mechanisms for
   pairwise social interactions. Using relatedness as a measure of the
   strength of kin selection, responsiveness as a measure of reciprocity,
   and synergy as a measure of payoff nonlinearity, I show how different
   combinations of these three parameters produce directional selection for
   or against cooperation or variation in levels of cooperation via
   stabilizing or diversifying selection. Moreover, each of these outcomes
   maps uniquely to one of four classic games from evolutionary game
   theory, which means that modulating relatedness, responsiveness, and
   synergy effectively transforms the payoff matrix from one the
   evolutionary game to another. Assuming that cooperation exacts a
   fertility cost on cooperators and provides a fertility benefit to social
   partners, a prisoner's dilemma game and directional selection against
   cooperation occur when relatedness and responsiveness are low and
   synergy is not too positive. Enough positive synergy in these conditions
   generates a stag-hunt game and diversifying selection. High levels of
   relatedness or responsiveness turn cooperation from a fitness cost into
   a fitness benefit, which produces a mutualism game and directional
   selection for cooperation when synergy is not too negative. Sufficiently
   negative synergy in this case creates a hawk-dove game and stabilizing
   selection for cooperation. I extend the results with relatedness and
   synergy to social groups and show that how group size changes the effect
   of relatedness and synergy on selection for cooperation depends on how
   the per capita benefit of cooperation changes with group size. Together,
   these results provide a general framework with which to generate
   comparative predictions that can be tested using quantitative genetic
   techniques and experimental techniques that manipulate investment in
   cooperation. These predictions will help us understand both
   interspecific variation in cooperation as well as within-population and
   within-group variation in cooperation related to behavioral syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{Despite essential progress towards understanding the evolution of
   cooperative behaviour, we still lack detailed knowledge about its
   underlying molecular mechanisms, genetic basis, evolutionary dynamics
   and ontogeny. An international workshop ``Genetics and Development of
   Cooperation,{''} organized by the University of Bern (Switzerland),
   aimed at discussing the current progress in this research field and
   suggesting avenues for future research. This review uses the major
   themes of the meeting as a springboard to synthesize the concepts of
   genetic and nongenetic inheritance of cooperation, and to review a
   quantitative genetic framework that allows for the inclusion of indirect
   genetic effects. Furthermore, we argue that including nongenetic
   inheritance, such as transgenerational epigenetic effects, parental
   effects, ecological and cultural inheritance, provides a more nuanced
   view of the evolution of cooperation. We summarize those genes and
   molecular pathways in a range of species that seem promising candidates
   for mechanisms underlying cooperative behaviours. Concerning the
   neurobiological substrate of cooperation, we suggest three cognitive
   skills necessary for the ability to cooperate: (i) event memory, (ii)
   synchrony with others and (iii) responsiveness to others. Taking a
   closer look at the developmental trajectories that lead to the
   expression of cooperative behaviours, we discuss the dichotomy between
   early morphological specialization in social insects and more flexible
   behavioural specialization in cooperatively breeding vertebrates.
   Finally, we provide recommendations for which biological systems and
   species may be particularly suitable, which specific traits and
   parameters should be measured, what type of approaches should be
   followed, and which methods should be employed in studies of cooperation
   to better understand how cooperation evolves and manifests in nature.}},

Abstract = {{An individual's genes may influence the phenotype of neighboring
   conspecifics. Such indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are important as they
   can affect the apparent total heritable variance in a population, and
   thus the response to selection. We studied these effects in a large,
   pedigreed population of Eucalyptus globulus using variance component
   analyses of Mycosphearella leaf disease, diameter growth at age 2 years,
   and post-infection diameter growth at ages 4 and 8 years. In a novel
   approach, we initially modeled IGEs using a factor analytic (FA)
   structure to identify the most influential neighbor positions, with the
   FA loadings being position-specific regressions on the IGEs. This
   involved sequentially comparing FA models for the variance-covariance
   matrices of the direct and indirect effects of each neighbor. We then
   modeled IGEs as a distance-based, combined effect of the most
   influential neighbors. This often increased the magnitude and
   significance of indirect genetic variance estimates relative to using
   all neighbors. The extension of a univariate IGEs model to bivariate
   analyses also provided insights into the genetic architecture of this
   population, revealing that: (1) IGEs arising from increased probability
   of neighbor infection were not associated with reduced growth of
   neighbors, despite adverse fitness effects being evident at the direct
   genetic level; and (2) the strong, genetic-based competitive
   interactions for growth, established early in stand development, were
   highly positively correlated over time. Our results highlight the
   complexities of genetic-based interactions at the multi-trait level due
   to (co) variances associated with IGEs, and the marked discrepancy
   occurring between direct and total heritable variances.}},

Title = {{Indirect genetic effects: a key component of the genetic architecture of
   behaviour}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{Behavioural ecology research increasingly focuses on why genetic
   behavioural variation can persist despite selection. Evolutionary theory
   predicts that directional selection leads to evolutionary change while
   depleting standing genetic variation. Nevertheless, evolutionary stasis
   may occur for traits involved in social interactions. This requires
   tight negative genetic correlations between direct genetic effects
   (DGEs) of an individual's genes on its own phenotype and the indirect
   genetic effects (IGEs) it has on conspecifics, as this could diminish
   the amount of genetic variation available to selection to act upon. We
   tested this prediction using a pedigreed laboratory population of
   Mediterranean field crickets (Gryllus bimaculatus), in which both
   exploratory tendency and aggression are heritable. We found that
   genotypes predisposed to be aggressive (due to DGEs) strongly decreased
   aggressiveness in opponents (due to IGEs). As a consequence, the
   variance in total breeding values was reduced to almost zero, implying
   that IGEs indeed greatly contribute to the occurrence of evolutionary
   stasis. IGEs were further associated with genetic variation in a
   non-social behaviour: explorative genotypes elicited most aggression in
   opponents. These key findings imply that IGEs indeed represent an
   important overlooked mechanism that can impact evolutionary dynamics of
   traits under selection.}},

Title = {{Interaction of direct and social genetic effects with feeding regime in
   growing rabbits}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{49}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Most rabbit production farms apply feed restriction at
   fattening because of its protective effect against digestive diseases
   that affect growing rabbits. However, it leads to competitive behaviour
   between cage mates, which is not observed when animals are fed ad
   libitum. Our aim was to estimate the contribution of direct (d) and
   social (s) genetic effects (also known as indirect genetic effects) to
   total heritable variance of average daily gain (ADG) in rabbits on
   different feeding regimens (FR), and the magnitude of the interaction
   between genotype and FR (G x FR).
   Methods: A total of 6264 contemporary kits were housed in cages of eight
   individuals and raised on full (F) or restricted (R) feeding to 75\% of
   the ad libitum intake. A Bayesian analysis of weekly records of ADG
   (from 32 to 60 days of age) in rabbits on F and R was performed with a
   two-trait model including d and s.
   Results: The ratio between total heritable variance and phenotypic
   variance (T 2) was low (<0.10) and did not differ significantly between
   FR. However, the ratio between h(2) (i.e. variance of d relative to
   phenotypic variance) and T 2 was similar to 0.52 and 0.86 for animals on
   R and F, respectively, thus s contributed more to the heritable variance
   of animals on R than on F. Feeding regimen also affected the sign and
   magnitude of the correlation between d and s, i.e. -0.5 and similar to 0
   for animals on R and F, respectively. The posterior mean (posterior sd)
   of the correlation between estimated total breeding values (ETBV) of
   animals on R and F was 0.26 (0.20), indicating very strong G x FR
   interactions. The correlations between d and s in rabbits on F and R
   ranged from -0.47 (d on F and s on R) to 0.64.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that selection of rabbits for ADG under
   F may completely fail to improve ADG in rabbits on R. Social genetic
   effects contribute substantially to ETBV of rabbits on R but not on F.
   Selection for ADG should be performed under production conditions
   regarding the FR, by accounting for s if the amount of food is limited.}},

Abstract = {{Despite strong purifying or directional selection, variation is
   ubiquitous in populations. One mechanism for the maintenance of
   variation is indirect genetic effects (IGEs), as the fitness of a given
   genotype will depend somewhat on the genes of its social partners. IGEs
   describe the effect of genes in social partners on the expression of the
   phenotype of a focal individual. Here, we ask what effect IGEs, and
   variation in IGEs between abiotic environments, has on locomotion in
   Drosophila. This trait is known to be subject to intralocus sexually
   antagonistic selection. We estimate the coefficient of interaction, ,
   using six inbred lines of Drosophila. We found that varied between
   abiotic environments, and that it may vary across among male genotypes
   in an abiotic environment specific manner. We also found evidence that
   social effects of males alter the value of a sexually dimorphic trait in
   females, highlighting an interesting avenue for future research into
   sexual antagonism. We conclude that IGEs are an important component of
   social and sexual interactions and that they vary between individuals
   and abiotic environments in complex ways, with the potential to promote

Abstract = {{Individuals often interact more closely with some members of the
   population (e.g., offspring, siblings, or group members) than they do
   with other individuals. This structuring of interactions can lead to
   multilevel natural selection, where traits expressed at the group-level
   influence fitness alongside individual-level traits. Such multilevel
   selection can alter evolutionary trajectories, yet is rarely quantified
   in the wild, especially for species that do not interact in clearly
   demarcated groups. We quantified multilevel natural selection on two
   traits, postnatal growth rate and birth date, in a population of North
   American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). The strongest level of
   selection was typically within-acoustic social neighborhoods (within 130
   m of the nest), where growing faster and being born earlier than nearby
   litters was key, while selection on growth rate was also apparent both
   within-litters and within-study areas. Higher population densities
   increased the strength of selection for earlier breeding, but did not
   influence selection on growth rates. Females experienced especially
   strong selection on growth rate at the within-litter level, possibly
   linked to the biased bequeathal of the maternal territory to daughters.
   Our results demonstrate the importance of considering multilevel and
   sex-specific selection in wild species, including those that are
   territorial and sexually monomorphic.}},

Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{Genotype by genotype indirect genetic effects (G x G IGEs) occur when
   the phenotype of an individual is influenced by an interaction between
   its own genotype and those of neighbour individuals. Little is known
   regarding the relative importance of G x G IGEs compared with other
   forms of direct and indirect genetic effects. We quantified the relative
   importance of IGEs in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, a
   species in which IGEs are likely to be important as air-borne social
   interactions are known to affect growth. We used a collection of
   distantly related wild isolates, lab strains and a set of closely
   related mutation accumulation lines to estimate the contribution of
   direct and indirect genetic effects on mycelium growth rate, a key
   fitness component. We found that indirect genetic effects were dominated
   by Gx G IGEs that occurred primarily between a focal genotype and its
   immediate neighbour within a vertical stack, and these accounted for
   11\% of phenotypic variation. These results indicate that G x G IGEs may
   be substantial, at least in some systems, and that the evolutionary
   importance of these interactions may be underappreciated, especially in
   microbes. We advocate for a wider use of the IGE framework in both
   applied (for example, choice of varietal mixtures in plant breeding) and
   evolutionary genetics (kin selection/kin competition studies).}},

Title = {{Interpreting selection when individuals interact}},

Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{1. A useful interpretation of quantitative genetic models of
   evolutionary change is that they (i) define a set of phenotypes that
   have a causal effect on fitness and on which selection acts, and (ii)
   define a set of breeding values that change as a correlated response to
   that selection because they covary with the phenotypes.
   2. When the expression of one trait causes variation in other traits
   then there are multiple paths by which a trait can cause fitness
   variation. Because of this, there are multiple ways in which selection
   can be defined, and still be consistent with a causal effect of traits
   on fitness.
   3. We use this result to show that genetical theories of natural/kin
   selection ignore causation and because of this we suggest they shed
   little light on the nature of selection.
   4. When traits expressed by an individual are affected by traits of
   their social partners (indirect genetic effects), we suggest a causal
   partitioning that allows selection to be cast in terms of Hamilton's
   costs and benefits.
   5. We show that previous attempts to understand Hamilton's rule in the
   context of indirect genetic effects either lack generality, or do not
   adequately describe all the ways in which an individual's actions
   constitute a cost to the individual or a benefit to its social
   partner(s).
   6. Our results allow us to explore Hamilton's rule in a multitrait
   setting. We show that evolution always increases inclusive fitness, and
   when the traits are measured in units of generalised genetic distance
   evolutionary change in the traits is in the direction in which inclusive
   fitness increases the fastest.
   7. However, we show that Hamilton's rule only holds in a multitrait
   context when the suite of traits are at equilibrium. When they are out
   of equilibrium, the conditions for altruism to evolve may be more or
   less stringent depending on genetic architecture and how costs and
   benefits are defined.}},

Abstract = {{Models of cooperation among nonkin suggest that social assortment is
   important for the evolution of cooperation. Theory predicts that
   interacting phenotypes, whereby an individual's behavior depends on the
   behavior of its social partners, can drive such social assortment. We
   measured repeated indirect genetic effects (IGEs) during cooperative
   predator inspection in eight populations of Trinidadian guppies
   (Poecilia reticulata) that vary in their evolutionary history of
   predation. Four broad patterns emerged that were dependent on river,
   predation history, and sex: (i) current partner behavior had the largest
   effect on focal behavior, with fish from low-predation habitats
   responding more to their social partners than fish from high-predation
   habitats; (ii) different focal/partner behavior combinations can
   generate cooperation; (iii) some high-predation fish exhibited carryover
   effects across social partners; and (iv) high-predation fish were more
   risk averse. These results provide the first large-scale comparison of
   interacting phenotypes during cooperation across wild animal
   populations, highlighting the potential importance of IGEs in
   maintaining cooperation. Intriguingly, while focal fish responded
   strongly to current social partners, carryover effects between social
   partners suggest generalized reciprocity (in which one helps anyone if
   helped by someone) may contribute to the evolution of cooperation in
   some, but not all, populations of guppies.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are abundant, both in natural and
   domestic populations, and may affect phenotypes of individuals. Recent
   research has demonstrated that the social effect of an individual on the
   phenotype of its social partners may have a genetic component, known as
   an indirect genetic effect (IGE). Little is known, however, of
   nongenetic factors underlying such social effects. Early-life
   environments often have large effects on phenotypes of the individuals
   themselves later in life. Offspring development in many mammalian
   species, for example, depends on interactions with the mother and
   siblings. In domestic pigs, individuals sharing the same juvenile
   environment develop similar body weight later in life. We, therefore,
   hypothesized that offspring originating from the same early-life
   environment also develop common social skills that generate early-life
   social effects (ELSEs) that affect the phenotypes of their social
   partners later in life. We, therefore, quantified IGEs and ELSEs on
   growth in domestic pigs. Results show that individuals from the same
   early-life environment express similar social effects on the growth of
   their social partners, and that such ELSEs shape the growth rate of
   social partners more than IGEs. Thus, the social skills that individuals
   develop in early life have a long-lasting impact on the phenotypes of
   social partners. Early-life and genetic social effects were independent
   of the corresponding direct effects of offspring on their own growth,
   indicating that individuals may enhance the growth of their social
   partners without a personal cost. Our findings also illustrate how
   research devoted to quantifying IGEs may miss nongenetic and potentially
   confounded social mechanisms which may bias the estimates of IGEs.}},

Abstract = {{Female mate choice is a complex decision-making process that involves
   many context-dependent factors. In Drosophila melanogaster, a model
   species for the study of sexual selection, indirect genetic effects
   (IGEs) of general social interactions can influence female mate choice
   behaviors, but the potential impacts of IGEs associated with mating
   experiences are poorly understood. Here, we examined whether the IGEs
   associated with a previous mating experience had an effect on subsequent
   female mate choice behaviors and quantified the degree of additive
   genetic variation associated with this effect. Females from 21 different
   genetic backgrounds were housed with males from one of two distinct
   genetic backgrounds for either a short (3 hr) or long (48 hr) exposure
   period and their subsequent mate choice behaviors were scored. We found
   that the genetic identity of a previous mate significantly influenced a
   female's subsequent interest in males and preference of males.
   Additionally, a hemiclonal analysis revealed significant additive
   genetic variation associated with experience-dependent mate choice
   behaviors, indicating a genotype-by-environment interaction for both of
   these parameters. We discuss the significance of these results with
   regard to the evolution of plasticity in female mate choice behaviors
   and the maintenance of variation in harmful male traits.}},

Abstract = {{The expression of an individual's phenotypic traits can be influenced by
   genes expressed in its social partners. Theoretical models predict that
   such indirect genetic effects (IGEs) on reproductive traits should play
   an important role in determining the evolutionary outcome of sexual
   conflict. However, empirical tests of (i) whether reproductive IGEs
   exist, (ii) how they vary among genotypes, and (iii) whether they are
   uniform for different types of reproductive traits are largely lacking.
   We addressed this in a series of experiments in the simultaneously
   hermaphroditic flatworm Macrostomum lignano. We found strong evidence
   for IGEs on both morphological and behavioral reproductive traits.
   Partner genotype had a significant impact on the testis size of focal
   individualsvarying up to 2.4-foldsuggesting that IGEs could mediate
   sexual conflicts that target the male sex function. We also found that
   time to first copulation was affected by a genotype x genotype
   interaction between mating partners, and that partner genotype affected
   the propensity to copulate and perform the postcopulatory suck behavior,
   which may mediate conflicts over the fate of received ejaculate
   components. These findings provide clear empirical evidence for IGEs on
   multiple behavioral and morphological reproductive traits, which
   suggests that the evolutionary dynamics of these traits could be altered
   by genes contained in the social environment.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment modulates gene expression, physiology, behaviour
   and patterns of inheritance. For more than 50 years, this concept has
   been investigated using approaches that include partitioning the social
   component out of behavioural heritability estimates, studying maternal
   effects on offspring, and analysing dominance hierarchies. Recent
   advances have formalized this `social environment effect' by providing a
   more nuanced approach to the study of social influences on behaviour
   while recognizing evolutionary implications. Yet, in most of these
   formulations, the dynamics of social interactions are not accounted for.
   Also, the reciprocity between individual behaviour and group-level
   interactions has been largely ignored. Consistent with evolutionary
   theory, the principles of social interaction are conserved across a
   broad range of taxa. While noting parallels in diverse organisms, this
   review uses Drosophila melanogaster as a case study to revisit what is
   known about social interaction paradigms. We highlight the benefits of
   integrating the history and pattern of interactions among individuals
   for dissecting molecular mechanisms that underlie social modulation of
   behaviour.}},

Volume = {{118}},

Abstract = {{Individuals are not merely subject to their social environments; they
   choose and create them, through a process called social environment (or
   social niche) construction. When genotypes differ in social
   environment-constructing behaviors, different genotypes are expected to
   experience different social environments. As social experience often
   affects behavioral development, quantitative genetics and psychology
   theories predict that genetic variation in social environment
   construction should have an important role in determining phenotypic
   variation; however, this hypothesis has not been tested directly. I
   identify multiple mechanisms of social environment construction that
   differ among natural genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster and
   investigate their consequences for the development of aggressive
   behavior. Male genotypes differed in the group sizes that they preferred
   and in their aggressive behavior; both of these behaviors influenced
   social experience, demonstrating that these behaviors function as social
   environment-constructing traits. Further, the effects of social
   experience-as determined in part by social environment
   construction-carried over to affect focal male aggression at a later
   time and with a new opponent. These results provide manipulative
   experimental support for longstanding hypotheses in psychology, that
   genetic variation in social environment construction has a causal role
   in behavioral development. More broadly, these results imply that
   studies of the genetic basis of complex traits should be expanded to
   include mechanisms by which genetic variation shapes the environments
   that individuals experience.}},

Abstract = {{Male secondary sexual traits and female mate choice traits must contain
   heritable variation for sexual selection to operate. However, for female
   mate choice, especially, this is poorly known. To complicate matters,
   both male sexual traits and female mate choice typically show condition
   dependence, implying that environmental effects probably play an
   important synergistic role. Using a cross-fostering design, we therefore
   aimed to disentangle genetic, environmental and their potential
   interacting effects to investigate how they affect the expression of a
   sexually selected trait (here birdsong) and female mate choice. To
   assess environmental effects, we focused on the role of the social
   environment and thus on learned components. Among the different male
   song traits investigated, we found a high heritability for song bout
   length and song bout repertoire, as well as an intriguing
   gene-by-environment interaction for song bout repertoire. Specifically,
   the tutor appeared to negatively affect the song bout repertoire of the
   tutee when his genetic father had a large song bout repertoire but had a
   positive effect on descendants from fathers with small song bout
   repertoires. In contrast, we did not detect significant heritability in
   female mate choice. Female mate choice contained a learned component as
   females significantly disfavoured their foster father in the mate choice
   tests, indicating a learned inbreeding avoidance. Thus, our study
   provides important insights into the role of the social environment for
   both birdsong and female mate choice. However, the absence of a
   heritable component in female mate choice suggests a need for studies
   investigating the heritability of female preferences for (heritable)
   male song traits in order to gain a better understanding of a potential
   coevolution between male sexual traits and female mate choice. Overall,
   our results suggest that indirect genetic effects acting during the pre-
   and postfledging social contexts may play a prominent role in sexual
   selection. (C) 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Species exhibiting colour polymorphism are thought to have an ecological
   advantage at the landscape scale, because spatial segregation of
   alternatively adapted ecotypes into diverse habitats can increase the
   species' niche breadth and thus confer greater geographic range size.
   However, morph frequencies are also influenced by intrapopulational
   processes such as frequency- or density-dependent social interactions.
   To identify how social feedback may affect clinal variation in morph
   frequencies, we investigated reciprocal interactions between
   morph-specific thermal tolerance, local climatic conditions and social
   environments, in the context of a colour-morph frequency cline
   associated with a recent range expansion in blue-tailed damselflies
   (Ischnura elegans) in Sweden. Cold tolerances of gynochromes
   (female-like female morph) were positively correlated with local
   gynochrome frequencies, suggesting a positive frequency-dependent
   fitness benefit. In contrast, androchrome (male-mimic female morph) cold
   tolerances were improved following recent exposure to cold weather,
   suggesting a beneficial environmental acclimation effect. Thus,
   according to an environment-matching hypothesis for clinal variation,
   androchrome frequencies should therefore increase towards the (cooler)
   range limit. In contrast to this prediction, gynochrome frequencies
   increased at the expanding range limit, consistent with a positive
   frequency-dependent social feedback that is beneficial when invading
   novel climates. Our results suggest that when phenotypes or fitnesses
   are affected by interactions with conspecifics, beneficial social
   effects on environmental tolerances may (i) facilitate range shifts, and
   (ii) reverse or counteract typical patterns of intraspecific
   interactions and environment-matching clines observed in stable
   populations observed over broader geographic scales.}},

Abstract = {{In populations with male mate-choice copying, males may mitigate their
   risk of sexual competition by reducing their preference for a particular
   female in the presence of sexual rivals (audience). Because of the cost
   of missed mating opportunities from such an audience effect, males
   should reduce their mating preference to a greater extent in the
   presence of more sexually competitive rivals compared with less
   competitive ones. We tested this hypothesis using the Trinidadian guppy
   (Poecilia reticulata). We compared a focal male's baseline mating
   preference for either of 2 stimulus females, which differed in overall
   body size, in the absence of any sexual rival to his preference for the
   same females in the presence of a sexual rival using dichotomous-choice
   tests. Focal and audience males differed in body length and proportion
   of their body covered in orange and black pigmentation. In the presence
   of a larger rival, focal males exhibited a greater reduction in
   preference for their initially preferred female compared to focal males
   in the presence of a smaller rival, irrespective of whether the latter
   male was more or less ornamented than the focal. The strength of the
   initial mating preference of focal males and the magnitude of the
   audience effect were significantly positively correlated when the
   audience male was larger than the focal male. Male guppies are thus
   sensitive to the phenotype of nearby males and alter their preference
   for a particular mate to a greater extent in the presence of relatively
   larger eavesdropping males compared to smaller ones.}},

Abstract = {{1. Despite a central line of research aimed at quantifying relationships
   between mating success and sexually dimorphic traits (e. g., ornaments),
   individual variation in sexually selected traits often explains only a
   modest portion of the variation in mating success.
   2. Another line of research suggests that a significant portion of the
   variation in mating success observed in animal populations could be
   explained by correlational selection, where the fitness advantage of a
   given trait depends on other components of an individual's phenotype
   and/or its environment. We tested the hypothesis that interactions
   between multiple traits within an individual (phenotype dependence) or
   between an individual's phenotype and its social environment (context
   dependence) can select for individual differences in behaviour (i. e.,
   personality) and social plasticity.
   3. To quantify the importance of phenotype-and context-dependent
   selection on mating success, we repeatedly measured the behaviour,
   social environment and mating success of about 300 male stream water
   striders, Aquarius remigis. Rather than explaining individual
   differences in long-term mating success, we instead quantified how the
   combination of a male's phenotype interacted with the immediate social
   context to explain variation in hour-by-hour mating decisions. We
   suggest that this analysis captures more of the mechanisms leading to
   differences in mating success.
   4. Males differed consistently in activity, aggressiveness and social
   plasticity. The mating advantage of these behavioural traits depended on
   male morphology and varied with the number of rival males in the pool,
   suggesting mechanisms selecting for consistent differences in behaviour
   and social plasticity. Accounting for phenotype and context dependence
   improved the amount of variation in male mating success we explained
   statistically by 30-274\%.
   5. Our analysis of the determinants of male mating success provides
   important insights into the evolutionary forces that shape phenotypic
   variation. In particular, our results suggest that sexual selection is
   likely to favour individual differences in behaviour, social plasticity
   (i. e., individuals adjusting their behaviour), niche preference (i. e.,
   individuals dispersing to particular social conditions) or social niche
   construction (i. e., individuals modifying the social environment). The
   true effect of sexual traits can only be understood in interaction with
   the individual's phenotype and environment.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality of laying hens due to cannibalism is a major problem in the
   egg-laying industry. Survival depends on two genetic effects: the direct
   genetic effect of the individual itself (DGE) and the indirect genetic
   effects of its group mates (IGE). For hens housed in sire-family groups,
   DGE and IGE cannot be estimated using pedigree information, but the
   combined effect of DGE and IGE is estimated in the total breeding value
   (TBV). Genomic information provides information on actual genetic
   relationships between individuals and might be a tool to improve TBV
   accuracy. We investigated whether genomic information of the sire
   increased TBV accuracy compared with pedigree information, and we
   estimated genetic parameters for survival time. A sire model with
   pedigree information (BLUP) and a sire model with genomic information
   (ssGBLUP) were used. We used survival time records of 7290 crossbred
   offspring with intact beaks from four crosses. Cross-validation was used
   to compare the models. Using ssGBLUP did not improve TBV accuracy
   compared with BLUP which is probably due to the limited number of sires
   available per cross (similar to 50). Genetic parameter estimates were
   similar for BLUP and ssGBLUP. For both BLUP and ssGBLUP, total heritable
   variance (T-2), expressed as a proportion of phenotypic variance, ranged
   from 0.03 +/- 0.04 to 0.25 +/- 0.09. Further research is needed on
   breeding value estimation for socially affected traits measured on
   individuals kept in single-family groups.}},

Title = {{You are what you eat: diet shapes body composition, personality and
   behavioural stability}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Behavioural phenotypes vary within and among individuals.
   While early-life experiences have repeatedly been proposed to underpin
   interactions between these two hierarchical levels, the environmental
   factors causing such effects remain under-studied. We tested whether an
   individual's diet affected both its body composition, average behaviour
   (thereby causing among-individual variation or `personality') and
   within-individual variability in behaviour and body weight (thereby
   causing among-individual differences in residual within-individual
   variance or `stability'), using the Southern field cricket Gryllus
   bimaculatus as a model. We further asked whether effects of diet on the
   expression of these variance components were sex-specific.
   Methods: Manipulating both juvenile and adult diet in a full factorial
   design, individuals were put, in each life-stage, on a diet that was
   either relatively high in carbohydrates or relatively high in protein.
   We subsequently measured the expression of multiple behavioural
   (exploration, aggression and mating activity) and morphological traits
   (body weight and lipid mass) during adulthood.
   Results: Dietary history affected both average phenotype and level of
   within-individual variability: males raised as juveniles on high-protein
   diets were heavier, more aggressive, more active during mating, and
   behaviourally less stable, than conspecifics raised on high-carbohydrate
   diets. Females preferred more protein in their diet compared to males,
   and dietary history affected average phenotype and within-individual
   variability in a sex-specific manner: individuals raised on high-protein
   diets were behaviourally less stable in their aggressiveness but this
   effect was only present in males. Diet also influenced individual
   differences in male body weight, but within-individual variance in
   female body weight.
   Discussion: This study thereby provides experimental evidence that
   dietary history explains both heterogeneous residual within-individual
   variance (i.e., individual variation in `behavioural stability') and
   individual differences in average behaviour (i.e., /personality'),
   though dietary effects were notably trait-specific. These findings call
   for future studies integrating proximate and ultimate perspectives on
   the role of diet in the evolution of repeatedly expressed traits, such
   as behaviour and body weight.}},

Abstract = {{Social networks encompass both individual and group phenotypes that have
   been shown to covary with fitness in several species. In order for
   network characters to be evolutionarily important, they must reliably
   reflect properties of an individual or groups of individuals; however,
   it is unknown whether network traits are consistently expressed at
   either level. To determine if measurable components of individual social
   network position were repeatable and if the network structure as a whole
   was consistent in Bolitotherus cornutus (the forked fungus beetle), we
   constructed 8 experimental populations. Half of the populations were
   disturbed between 2 observation periods. Two individual network metrics
   (strength and betweenness) were significantly repeatable across time in
   all treatments; a third (clustering coefficient) was not. At the network
   level, all 3 metrics changed more in undisturbed than disturbed
   networks. These findings suggest that individual network position can be
   a consistent property of individuals that is resilient to disturbance
   and could experience selection in a predictable fashion. However, group
   network structure seems to change over time unless reset by disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{The interplay between consistent individual differences in behavior
   (i.e., animal personality) and behavioral plasticity has recently
   attracted increased interest. We used male Australian field crickets
   (Teleogryllus oceanicus) to investigate how dominance status influences
   the consistency and plasticity of different personality traits, namely
   boldness, exploration, and activity, by experimentally manipulating
   dominance status between measuring sessions. We found that dominants
   that became subordinate when socially challenged, shifted their
   behavior, becoming less bold, explorative, and active, whereas
   subordinates that became dominant, became bolder, more explorative, and
   more active. Individuals that experienced no change in dominance status
   did not alter their behavior. Changes in dominance status reduced the
   repeatability of the putative personality traits of exploration and
   activity while not affecting the repeatability of boldness. Moreover,
   changes in dominance status affected the presence of correlations
   between some personality traits, but not others. Finally, calling
   behavior was related to current and future dominance and explorative
   tendencies. We discuss the broader evolutionary and ecological
   implications of our findings and propose that changes in social status
   should be considered when investigating behavioral syndromes and the
   interplay between animal personality and behavioral plasticity.}},

Abstract = {{Social genetic effects (SGE) are genetic effects of an individual that

   were divided into two groups based on their estimated SGE: positive SGE
   sows (+SGE) and negative SGE sows (-SGE). At the time of selection,
   gilts were contemporaries and similarly managed. We recorded the
   reproductive performance of the two groups based on parity until
   culling. Reproductive performance included the total number of piglets
   born (TNB), number of piglets born alive (NBA), average piglet birth
   weight (BW), coefficient of variation for birth weight (CVBW), age at
   first farrowing (AFF), weaning to estrus interval (WEI), and gestation
   length (GL). TNB was 0.5 higher for +SGE sows (13.8) than for -SGE sows
   (P = 0.03, SEM = 0.06), and NBA exhibited a higher tendency in +SGE sows

Abstract = {{Assessing the impact of the social environment on health and disease is
   challenging. As social effects are in part determined by the genetic
   makeup of social partners, they can be studied from associations between
   genotypes of one individual and phenotype of another (social genetic
   effects, SGE, also called indirect genetic effects). For the first time
   we quantified the contribution of SGE to more than 100 organismal
   phenotypes and genome-wide gene expression measured in laboratory mice.
   We find that genetic variation in cage mates (i.e. SGE) contributes to
   variation in organismal and molecular measures related to anxiety, wound
   healing, immune function, and body weight. Social genetic effects
   explained up to 29\% of phenotypic variance, and for several traits
   their contribution exceeded that of direct genetic effects (effects of
   an individual's genotypes on its own phenotype). Importantly, we show
   that ignoring SGE can severely bias estimates of direct genetic effects
   (heritability). Thus SGE may be an important source of ``missing
   heritability{''} in studies of complex traits in human populations. In
   summary, our study uncovers an important contribution of the social
   environment to phenotypic variation, sets the basis for using SGE to
   dissect social effects, and identifies an opportunity to improve studies
   of direct genetic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are a major driver of social evolution,
   but much of the experimental work pertaining to IGEs on social behaviour
   has focused on the effect of stimulus individuals on single focal
   individuals. We extended IGE research to examine how stimulus
   individuals influence social interactions among several focal
   individuals. Specifically, we relied on recent work on social behaviour
   in fruit flies to examine whether IGEs cause 12 stimulus flies of
   distinct genotypes to alter social interactions within groups of six
   focal flies. The social behaviour of focals was significantly affected
   by the genotype of the stimulus flies. Focals were closer together when
   grouped with stimulus flies from genotypes that were close together than
   when grouped with stimulus flies from genotypes that were farther apart.
   A mechanism mediating this effect was the encounter rate between focal
   flies, which was lowest when the focal flies were grouped with stimulus
   flies of the more cohesive genotypes. (C) 2016 The Association for the

Abstract = {{(Co) variance matrices for the assumed model, and thus the specification
   of the dispersion parameters, should take into account both the negative
   competition and the positive spatial correlations. In this context, we
   applied several approaches to identify and quantify the genetic and
   environmental competition effects and/or environmental heterogeneity in
   three Douglas-fir genetic trials from the British Columbia tree
   improvement program in total height and diameter at breast height at
   ages 12 and 35. Then, we applied an individual-tree mixed model to
   account jointly for competition effects and environmental heterogeneity
   (competition + spatial mixed model, CSM). We also compared the resulting
   estimates of all dispersion parameters and breeding values (BVs) with
   corresponding estimates from three simpler mixed models. Our analysis
   revealed that strong spatial environmental variation (predominantly at
   large-scale) covered the effects of competition in the three Douglas-fir
   progeny trials. While diameter at breast height at age 35 revealed
   strong competition effects at both genetic and environmental levels,
   these effects were not as strong for total height. In general, with
   strong competition genetic effects, the CSM gave a better fit than the
   simpler models. Ignoring competition effects and environmental
   heterogeneity resulted in lower additive genetic variances and higher
   residual variances than those estimated from the CSM. Ignoring
   competition effects leads to overestimating environmental heterogeneity,
   while ignoring the environmental heterogeneity leads to underestimating
   competition effects. Spearman correlations between BVs predicted from
   the simplest model and total BVs from the CSM were moderate to high. The
   implications of all these findings for the genetic improvement of
   coastal Douglas-fir in British Columbia are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among animals are general phenomena in domestic
   populations. However, at present, very little is known about the
   contribution of social effect to the selection efficiency of long-term
   response. In this study, the selection efficiency of a socially affected
   trait with different social effect was investigated in a closed nucleus
   population using stochastic simulation. Some key factors that affect
   selection efficiency of genetic social effect were also compared. The
   results showed social effect played an important role in a longer term
   breeding programme even though social effect had a small effect on the
   trait of interest. The percentage of expected total response contributed
   by social effect was up to 15.27 at the end generation under a very low
   level of social effect (0.3\% direct phenotypic variance). The full
   model with direct and social genetic effect, improved the selection
   efficiency of social effect and resulted in 4.89, 5.21 and 2.70\% more
   total cumulative selection response than the reduced model, without
   social effect, under the social effect size of 0.3, 1 and 10\% direct
   phenotypic variance, respectively. The social effect size and group
   member number showed more effect on the selection efficiency of social
   effect than other factors.}},

Abstract = {{Organizational processes during prenatal development can have long-term
   effects on an individual's phenotype. Because these early developmental
   stages are sensitive to environmental influences, mothers are in a
   unique position to alter their offspring's phenotype by differentially
   allocating resources to their developing young. However, such prenatal
   maternal effects are difficult to disentangle from other forms of
   parental care, additive genetic effects, and/or other forms of maternal
   inheritance, hampering our understanding of their evolutionary
   consequences. Here we used divergent selection lines for high and low
   prenatal maternal investment and their reciprocal line crosses in a
   precocial birdthe Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica)to quantify the
   relative importance of genes and prenatal maternal effects in shaping
   offspring phenotype. Maternal but not paternal origin strongly affected
   offspring body size and survival throughout development. Although the
   effects of maternal egg investment faded over time, they were large at
   key life stages. Additionally, there was evidence for other forms of
   maternal inheritance affecting offspring phenotype at later stages of
   development. Our study is among the first to successfully disentangle
   prenatal maternal effects from all other sources of confounding
   variation and highlights the important role of prenatal maternal
   provisioning in shaping offspring traits closely linked to fitness.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment of an animal is an especially interesting
   component of its environment because it can be shaped by both genetic
   and non-genetic variation among social partners. Indirect genetic
   effects (IGEs) are those created when genetic variation in social
   partners contributes to variation in an individual's phenotype; a
   potentially common form of IGE occurs when the expression of a
   behavioral phenotype depends on the particular genotypic combination of
   interacting individuals. Although IGEs can profoundly affect
   individual-and group-level fitness, population dynamics, and even
   community structure, understanding their importance is complicated by
   two inherent challenges: (1) identifying individuals with genetic
   differences in social interactions that can contribute to IGEs and (2)
   characterizing natural social interactions that potentially involve
   IGEs. As a first step toward addressing both these challenges in the
   same system, we investigated social interactions involving genetically
   distinct male color morphs in the poeciliid fish Gambusia holbrooki
   under natural and laboratory conditions. Previous work indicates that
   melanic (M) and silver (S) males differ in social behavior and in how
   conspecifics respond to them, suggesting the potential for IGEs. We used
   a combination of live and video recording of social groups in two
   natural populations and in the laboratory to determine the potential for
   IGEs to contribute to behavioral variation in this species. We found
   that M males had more social partners, and especially more female social
   partners than did S males, in nature and in the laboratory. These
   results suggest that both direct and indirect genetic effects have the
   potential to play a role in the expression and evolution of social
   behavior in G. holbrooki.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},

Abstract = {{Recognition of the ubiquity of female multiple mating has caused an
   important shift in sexual selection research, emphasizing the adaptive
   nature of female mating strategies. While phenotypic changes in female
   mating traits have been previously studied, little is known about the
   genetic basis of female mating behaviour and its potential to respond to
   selection at different stages throughout an individual's life. Using a
   large quantitative genetic breeding design, we observed lifetime female
   mating behaviour in Drosophila melanogaster to examine the effect of
   female age and mating history on three key mating traits: courtship
   latency, mating latency and copula duration. Courtship latency (time
   until males initiate courtship) decreased with the cumulative number of
   females' previous matings. Mating latency (defined here as the time
   between the beginning of courtship and the start of copulation)
   increased with female age, and copula duration was found to decrease as
   females aged. We calculated quantitative genetic estimates for mating
   traits in virgin females and at the females' third mating to examine
   changes in the evolutionary potential of mating traits. We found
   considerable additive genetic variation in courtship latency and mating
   latency measured in virgin females. Copula duration displayed no
   heritable variation among females across sire families, but male effects
   were consistent with the idea that this trait is under male control.
   Heritability estimates differed significantly from zero in virgin
   females for courtship latency and mating latency but not when females
   were mating for the third time. However, overlapping 84\% confidence
   intervals between heritability estimates obtained from virgin and mated
   females suggest that female mating strategies may have the potential to
   respond to selection at these different life stages. (C) 2016 The

Title = {{Direct and indirect genetic and fine-scale location effects on breeding
   date in song sparrows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},

Abstract = {{1. Quantifying direct and indirect genetic effects of interacting
   females and males on variation in jointly expressed life-history traits
   is central to predicting microevolutionary dynamics. However, accurately
   estimating sex-specific additive genetic variances in such traits
   remains difficult in wild populations, especially if related individuals
   inhabit similar fine-scale environments.
   2. Breeding date is a key life-history trait that responds to
   environmental phenology and mediates individual and population responses
   to environmental change. However, no studies have estimated female
   (direct) and male (indirect) additive genetic and inbreeding effects on
   breeding date, and estimated the cross-sex genetic correlation, while
   simultaneously accounting for fine-scale environmental effects of
   breeding locations, impeding prediction of microevolutionary dynamics.
   3. We fitted animal models to 38 years of song sparrow (Melospiza
   melodia) phenology and pedigree data to estimate sex-specific additive
   genetic variances in breeding date, and the cross-sex genetic
   correlation, thereby estimating the total additive genetic variance
   while simultaneously estimating sex-specific inbreeding depression. We
   further fitted three forms of spatial animal model to explicitly
   estimate variance in breeding date attributable to breeding location,
   overlap among breeding locations and spatial autocorrelation. We thereby
   quantified fine-scale location variances in breeding date and quantified
   the degree to which estimating such variances affected the estimated
   additive genetic variances.
   4. The non-spatial animal model estimated nonzero female and male
   additive genetic variances in breeding date (sex-specific
   heritabilities: 0.07 and 0.02, respectively) and a strong, positive
   cross-sex genetic correlation (0.99), creating substantial total
   additive genetic variance (0.18). Breeding date varied with female, but
   not male inbreeding coefficient, revealing direct, but not indirect,
   inbreeding depression. All three spatial animal models estimated small
   location variance in breeding date, but because relatedness and breeding
   location were virtually uncorrelated, modelling location variance did
   not alter the estimated additive genetic variances.
   5. Our results show that sex-specific additive genetic effects on
   breeding date can be strongly positively correlated, which would affect
   any predicted rates of microevolutionary change in response to sexually
   antagonistic or congruent selection. Further, we show that inbreeding
   effects on breeding date can also be sex specific and that genetic
   effects can exceed phenotypic variation stemming from fine-scale
   location-based variation within a wild population.}},

Abstract = {{Males of socially monogamous species can increase their siring success
   via within-pair and extra-pair fertilizations. In this study, we focused
   on the different sources of (co)variation between these siring routes,
   and asked how each contributes to total siring success. We quantified
   the fertilization routes to siring success, as well as behaviors that
   have been hypothesized to affect siring success, over a five-year period
   for a wild population of great tits Parus major. We considered siring
   success and its fertilization routes as ``interactive phenotypes{''}
   arising from phenotypic contributions of both members of the social
   pair. We show that siring success is strongly affected by the fecundity
   of the social (female) partner. We also demonstrate that a strong
   positive correlation between extra-pair fertilization success and
   paternity loss likely constrains the evolution of these two routes.
   Moreover, we show that more explorative and aggressive males had less
   extra-pair fertilizations, whereas more explorative females laid larger
   clutches. This study thus demonstrates that (co)variation in siring
   routes is caused by multiple factors not necessarily related to
   characteristics of males. We thereby highlight the importance of
   acknowledging the multilevel structure of male fertilization routes when
   studying the evolution of male mating strategies.}},

Title = {{Genomic prediction of survival time in a population of brown laying hens
   showing cannibalistic behavior}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mortality due to cannibalism causes both economic and
   welfare problems in laying hens. To limit mortality due to cannibalism,
   laying hens are often beak-trimmed, which is undesirable for animal
   welfare reasons. Genetic selection is an alternative strategy to
   increase survival and is more efficient by taking heritable variation
   that originates from social interactions into account, which are
   modelled as the so-called indirect genetic effects (IGE). Despite the
   considerable heritable variation in survival time due to IGE, genetic
   improvement of survival time in laying hens is still challenging because
   the detected heritable variation of the trait with IGE is still limited,
   ranging from 0.06 to 0.26, and individuals that are still alive at the
   end of the recording period are censored. Furthermore, survival time
   records are available late in life and only on females. To cope with
   these challenges, we tested the hypothesis that genomic prediction
   increases the accuracy of estimated breeding values (EBV) compared to
   parental average EBV, and increases response to selection for survival
   time compared to a traditional breeding scheme. We tested this
   hypothesis in two lines of brown layers with intact beaks, which show
   cannibalism, and also the hypothesis that the rate of inbreeding per
   year is lower for genomic selection than for the traditional breeding
   scheme.
   Results and discussion: The standard deviation of genomic prediction EBV
   for survival time was around 22 days for both lines, indicating good
   prospects for selection against mortality in laying hens with intact
   beaks. Genomic prediction increased the accuracy of the EBV by 35 and 32
   \% compared to the parent average EBV for the two lines. At the current
   reference population size, predicted response to selection was 91 \%
   higher when using genomic selection than with the traditional breeding
   scheme, as a result of a shorter generation interval in males and
   greater accuracy of selection in females. The predicted rate of
   inbreeding per generation with truncation selection was substantially
   lower for genomic selection than for the traditional breeding scheme for
   both lines.
   Conclusions: Genomic selection for socially affected traits is a
   promising tool for the improvement of survival time in laying hens with
   intact beaks.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how genetic diversity, infections and fitness interact in
   wild populations is a major challenge in ecology and management. These
   interactions were addressed through heterozygosity-fitness correlation
   analyses, by assessing the genetic diversity, tuberculosis (TB) and body
   size in adult red deer. Heterozygosity-fitness correlation models
   provided a better understanding of the link between genetic diversity
   and TB at individual and population levels. A single local effect was
   found for Ceh45 locus at individual level, enhancing the importance of
   its close functional genes in determining TB presence. At population
   level, the ability of the red deer to control TB progression correlated
   positively with population genetic diversity, indicating that inbred
   populations might represent more risk of deer TB severity. Statistical
   models also gained insights into the dynamics of multi-host interaction
   in natural environments. TB prevalence in neighbouring wild boar
   populations was positively associated with deer TB at both individual
   and population levels. Additionally, TB presence correlated positively
   with red deer body size, for which ``general and local effect{''}
   hypotheses were found. Although body size might be correlated with age,
   an indirect genetic effect on TB presence could be implied. This study
   provides new insights towards understanding host-pathogen interactions
   in wild populations and their relation to fitness traits. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A key requirement for social cooperation is the mitigation and/or social
   regulation of aggression towards other group members. Populations of the
   harvester ant Pogonomyrmex californicus show the alternate social
   phenotypes of queens founding nests alone (haplometrosis) or in groups
   of unrelated yet cooperative individuals (pleometrosis). Pleometrotic
   queens display an associated reduction in aggression. To understand the
   proximate drivers behind this variation, we placed foundresses of the
   two populations into social environments with queens from the same or
   the alternate population, and measured their behaviour and head gene
   expression profiles. A proportion of queens from both populations
   behaved aggressively, but haplometrotic queens were significantly more
   likely to perform aggressive acts, and conflict escalated more
   frequently in pairs of haplometrotic queens. Whole-head RNA sequencing
   revealed variation in gene expression patterns, with the two populations
   showing moderate differentiation in overall transcriptional profile,
   suggesting that genetic differences underlie the two founding
   strategies. The largest detected difference, however, was associated
   with aggression, regardless of queen founding type. Several modules of
   coregulated genes, involved in metabolism, immune system and neuronal
   function, were found to be upregulated in highly aggressive queens.
   Conversely, nonaggressive queens exhibited a striking pattern of
   upregulation in chemosensory genes. Our results highlight that the
   social phenotypes of cooperative vs. solitary nest founding tap into a
   set of gene regulatory networks that seem to govern aggression level. We
   also present a number of highly connected hub genes associated with
   aggression, providing opportunity to further study the genetic
   underpinnings of social conflict and tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among animals are widely existed in livestock
   population. However, some studies showed that the selection of social
   genetic effect leaded to extra increase of inbreeding. In this study,
   two optimization methods (SBLUP+GA1, SBLUP+GA2) based on genetic
   algorithm were used to obtain the optimal genetic contributions of
   seedstocks and maximize the average genetic gains of direct and social
   genetic component while minimizing the inbreeding. In SBLUP+GA1, only
   the contributions of sires were optimized. In SBLUP+GA2, the
   contributions of sires and darns were optimized together. The results
   showed SBLUP+GA1 and SBLUP+GA2 resulted in 18.52\% and 25.93\% lower
   inbreeding rate than common social genetic effect selection based on
   BLUP method (SBLUP) under base parameters, respectively. Under that
   situation, the average gains for direct, social and total genetic effect
   component in SBLUP+GA1 were actually improved 3.59\%, 10.02\% and 432\%
   relative to SBLUP, respectively. In SBLUP+GA2, they were 1.28\%, 10.00\%
   and 2.02\%, respectively. SBLUP+GA2 resulted in lower inbreeding rate,
   but, obtained slightly less genetic gain than SBLUP+GA1. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The degree of inbreeding expressed within populations can profoundly
   shape evolutionary dynamics. The degree to which individuals inbreed is
   frequently assumed to evolve in response to selection, for example,
   resulting from inbreeding depression. Such evolutionary responses
   require additive genetic variance (V-A) in the degree to which
   individuals inbreed. However, the magnitude of V-A in the degree of
   biparental inbreeding has never been estimated. We devised a
   quantitative genetic model to estimate sex-specific V-A in the degree to
   which individuals inbreed while accounting for effects of individuals'
   own coefficients of inbreeding and genetic effects stemming from
   immigration. We applied this model to the degree of inbreeding expressed
   through social pairing in free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia).
   Estimates of V-A for both sexes appreciably exceeded 0 and the cross-sex
   genetic covariance was strongly positive, creating substantial total V-A
   in the degree of inbreeding. Our analyses also revealed inbreeding
   depression in the degree of inbreeding, such that more inbred
   individuals paired with closer relatives, and immigrant effects, such
   that individuals with greater genomic contributions from immigrants
   paired with more distant relatives. We thereby demonstrate that the
   degree of biparental inbreeding can show substantial V-A in nature and
   might consequently evolve in response to selection.}},

Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Polyandry is widespread despite its costs. The sexually selected sperm
   hypotheses ('sexy' and `good' sperm) posit that sperm competition plays
   a role in the evolution of polyandry. Two poorly studied assumptions of
   these hypotheses are the presence of additive genetic variance in
   polyandry and sperm competitiveness. Using a quantitative genetic
   breeding design in a natural population of Drosophila melanogaster, we
   first established the potential for polyandry to respond to selection.
   We then investigated whether polyandry can evolve through sexually
   selected sperm processes. We measured lifetime polyandry and offensive
   sperm competitiveness (P-2) while controlling for sampling variance due
   to male x male x female interactions. We also measured additive genetic
   variance in egg-to-adult viability and controlled for its effect on P-2
   estimates. Female lifetime polyandry showed significant and substantial
   additive genetic variance and evolvability. In contrast, we found little
   genetic variance or evolvability in P-2 or egg-to-adult viability.
   Additive genetic variance in polyandry highlights its potential to
   respond to selection. However, the low levels of genetic variance in
   sperm competitiveness suggest that the evolution of polyandry may not be
   driven by sexy sperm or good sperm processes.}},

Title = {{Inferring relationships between Phosphorus utilization, feed per gain,

   models}},
Journal = {{POULTRY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Phosphorus utilization (PU) has received considerable attention in
   poultry nutrition. However, reliable estimates of genetic parameters for
   PU and related traits have largely not been reported until now; however,
   these are needed to assess whether selection for an improved PU would
   result in selection response. A large Japanese quail F-2 cross was
   generated and 888 F2 individuals were phenotyped for PU, body-weight
   gain (BWG), and feed per gain (F:G). Because it can reasonably be
   assumed that the interrelationships between these traits are complex,
   structural equation models were used. The structural coefficient
   lambda(ij) describes the rate of change of trait i with respect to trait
   j for a model with a recursive effect of trait j on trait i. Three
   recursive structural coefficients (lambda(F:G,PU), lambda(BWG,PU),
   lambda(BWG,F:G)) were selected a priori based on biological knowledge.
   The model was fitted using ASReml software. Standard errors of estimated
   variance components and genetic parameters were approximated using the
   delta method. The heritability of PU, F: G, and BWG were 0.136, 0.118,
   and 0.092. The structural co-efficient (lambda) over cap (F:G,PU) =
   -0.177 indicates that an increase in PU leads to reduced and thus
   improved F: G. The estimate (lambda) over cap (BWG,F:G) = -0.963
   indicates that improved F: G leads to an increase in BWG. The overall
   effect of PU on BWG was (lambda) over cap (BWG,PU) + (lambda) over cap
   (F:G,PU) x (lambda) over cap (BWG,F:G) = 0.374, i.e. an increase in PU
   of 1\% leads to an increase of BWG of 0.374 g in the data collection
   period, which spanned five days. The phenotypic and genetic correlations
   were negative between PU and F: G as well as between BWG and F: G and
   were positive between PU and BWG. These correlations are driven by
   direct genetic effects (pleiotropic genes or genes being in linkage
   disequilibrium) as well as by indirect genetic effects (genes affecting
   trait j affected indirectly trait i). The application of structural
   equation models contributed to our understanding of the complex
   biological relationship between PU, F: G, and BWG in quails. PU shows a
   heritability that is sufficient to achieve a selection response when
   breeding for this very-hard-to-measure trait.}},

Abstract = {{Aggregation behaviour is the tendency for animals to group together,
   which may have important consequences on individual fitness. We used a
   combination of experimental and simulation approaches to study how
   genetic variation and social environment interact to influence
   aggregation dynamics in Drosophila. To do this, we used two different
   natural lines of Drosophila that arise from a polymorphism in the
   foraging gene (rovers and sitters). We placed groups of flies in a
   heated arena. Flies could freely move towards one of two small, cooler
   refuge areas. In groups of the same strain, sitters had a greater
   tendency to aggregate. The observed behavioural variation was based on
   only two parameters: the probability of entering a refuge and the
   likelihood of choosing a refuge based on the number of individuals
   present. We then directly addressed how different strains interact by
   mixing rovers and sitters within a group. Aggregation behaviour of each
   line was strongly affected by the presence of the other strain, without
   changing the decision rules used by each. Individuals obeying local
   rules shaped complex group dynamics via a constant feedback loop between
   the individual and the group. This study could help to identify the
   circumstances under which particular group compositions may improve
   individual fitness through underlying aggregation mechanisms under
   specific environmental conditions.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{Recent theory predicts that males should choose social environments that
   maximize their relative attractiveness to females by preferentially
   associating with less attractive rivals, so as to enhance their mating
   success. Using the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a highly
   social species, we tested for non-random social associations among males
   in mixedsex groups based on two phenotypic traits (body length and
   coloration) that predict relative sexual attractiveness to females and
   sexual (sperm) competitiveness. Based on a well-replicated laboratory
   dichotomous-choice test of social group preference, we could not reject
   the null hypothesis that focal males chose randomly between a mixed-sex
   group that comprised a female and a rival male that was less sexually
   attractive than themselves and another mixed-sex group containing a
   sexually more attractive male. The same conclusion was reached when
   females were absent from the two groups. As might be expected from these
   laboratory findings, free-ranging males in the field were not assorted
   by either body length or colour in mixed-sex shoals. The apparent lack
   of an evolved and expressed preference in wild male guppies from our
   study population to form social associations with other males based on
   their relative sexual attractiveness and competitiveness might be due to
   the fission-fusion dynamics of guppy shoals in nature. Such social
   dynamics likely places constraints on the formation of stable
   phenotype-based social associations among males. This possibility is
   supported by a simulation model which assumes group departure rules
   based on relative body size and coloration in males.}},

Abstract = {{Social context refers to the composition of an individual's social
   interactants, including potential mates. In spatially structured
   populations, social context can vary among individuals within
   populations, generating the opportunity for social selection to drive
   differences in fitness functions among individuals at a fine spatial
   scale. In sexually polymorphic plants, the local sex ratio varies at a
   fine scale and thus has the potential to generate this opportunity. We
   measured the spatial distribution of two wild populations of the
   gynodioecious plant Silene vulgaris and show that there is fine-scale
   heterogeneity in the local distribution of the sexes within these
   populations. We demonstrate that the largest variance in sex ratio is
   among nearest neighbors. This variance is greatly reduced as the spatial
   scale of social interactions increases. These patterns suggest the sex
   of neighbors has the potential to generate fine-scale differences in
   selection differentials among individuals. One of the most important
   determinants of social interactions in plants is the behavior of
   pollinators. These results suggest that the potential for selection
   arising from sex ratio will be greatest when pollen is shared among
   nearest neighbors. Future studies incorporating the movement of
   pollinators may reveal whether and how this fine-scale variance in sex
   ratio affects the fitness of individuals in these populations.}},

Volume = {{116}},

Abstract = {{Mitochondria are involved in ageing and their function requires
   coordinated action of both mitochondrial and nuclear genes. Epistasis
   between the two genomes can influence lifespan but whether this also
   holds for reproductive senescence is unclear. Maternal inheritance of
   mitochondria predicts sex differences in the efficacy of selection on
   mitonuclear genotypes that should result in differences between females
   and males in mitochondrial genetic effects. Mitonuclear genotype of a
   focal individual may also indirectly affect trait expression in the
   mating partner. We tested these predictions in the seed beetle
   Callosobruchus maculatus, using introgression lines harbouring distinct
   mitonuclear genotypes. Our results reveal both direct and indirect
   sexspecific effects of mitonuclear epistasis on reproductive ageing.
   Females harbouring coadapted mitonuclear genotypes showed higher
   lifetime fecundity due to slower senescence relative to novel
   mitonuclear combinations. We found no evidence for mitonuclear
   coadaptation in males. Mitonuclear epistasis not only affected
   age-specific ejaculate weight, but also influenced male age-dependent
   indirect effects on traits expressed by their female partners
   (fecundity, egg size, longevity). These results demonstrate important
   consequences of sex-specific mitonuclear epistasis for both mating
   partners, consistent with a role for mitonuclear genetic constraints
   upon sex-specific adaptive evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Theory predicts that intraspecific genetic variation can increase the
   complexity of an ecological network. To date, however, we are lacking
   empirical knowledge of the extent to which genetic variation determines
   the assembly of ecological networks, as well as how the gain or loss of
   genetic variation will affect network structure. To address this
   knowledge gap, we used a common garden experiment to quantify the extent
   to which heritable trait variation in a host plant determines the
   assembly of its associated insect food web (network of trophic
   interactions). We then used a resampling procedure to simulate the
   additive effects of genetic variation on overall food-web complexity. We
   found that trait variation among host-plant genotypes was associated
   with resistance to insect herbivores, which indirectly affected
   interactions between herbivores and their insect parasitoids. Direct and
   indirect genetic effects resulted in distinct compositions of trophic
   interactions associated with each host-plant genotype. Moreover, our
   simulations suggest that food-web complexity would increase by 20\% over
   the range of genetic variation in the experimental population of host
   plants. Taken together, our results indicate that intraspecific genetic
   variation can play a key role in structuring ecological networks, which
   may in turn affect network persistence.}},

Abstract = {{Parental care, a central component of reproduction in a wide range of
   animal species, often involves elaborate behavioural interactions
   between parents and their offspring. Due to the reciprocal nature of
   these interactions, it has been hypothesized that parental and offspring
   behaviours (e.g. parental food provisioning and offspring begging) are
   not only target but also agent of selection. These traits are therefore
   expected to co-evolve, ultimately leading to co-adaptation of parent and
   offspring behaviours within families. However, empirical data on such
   parent-offspring co-adaptation are limited, particularly for wild
   populations. Furthermore, mean levels of behaviour (as measured in
   previous studies) may not adequately describe the dynamic nature of the
   reciprocal interplay between parents and their offspring, and instead
   rather the behavioural reaction norms for provisioning and begging may
   be co-adapted. We applied a large-scale cross-fostering study over 3
   consecutive breeding seasons to investigate whether provisioning
   behaviour of wild blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) parents covaries with
   the begging behaviour of their genetic, cross-fostered offspring. We
   simultaneously analysed parent and offspring behaviours, both as static
   traits (mean levels) and behavioural reaction norms (offspring begging
   as a function of food deprivation and parental provisioning as a
   function of short-term experimental changes in brood size). Neither
   maternal nor paternal provisioning rates covaried with the begging
   intensity of their genetic offspring when analysed as mean levels of
   behaviour. However, the slopes of the reaction norms for provisioning
   and begging were negatively correlated between male, but not female,
   parents and their genetic offspring. Thus, fathers that change their
   provisioning rate strongly with brood size sire offspring whose level of
   begging only weakly increases with hunger, and vice versa. The observed
   covariation suggests the existence of sex-specific optima for
   parent-offspring trait combinations. Thus, our study not only highlights
   the importance of a behavioural reaction norm approach when
   investigating parent-offspring interactions, but also stresses the
   relevance of considering parents as separate units, at least for
   biparental species.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are abundant, both in wild and in
   domestic populations. With social interactions, the genes of an
   individual may affect the trait values of other individuals, a
   phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects (IGEs). IGEs can be
   estimated using linear mixed models. Most IGE models assume that
   individuals interact equally to all group mates irrespective of
   relatedness. Kin selection theory, however, predicts that an individual
   will interact differently with family members versus non-family members.
   Here, we investigate kin-and sex-specific non-genetic social
   interactions in group-housed mink. Furthermore, we investigated whether
   systematic non-genetic interactions between kin or individuals of the
   same sex influence the estimates of genetic parameters. As a second
   objective, we clarify the relationship between estimates of the
   traditional IGE model and a family-based IGE model proposed in a
   previous study. Our results indicate that male siblings in mink show
   different non-genetic interactions than female siblings in mink and that
   this may impact the estimation of genetic parameters. Moreover, we have
   shown how estimates from a family-based IGE model can be translated to
   the ordinary direct-indirect model and vice versa. We find no evidence
   for genetic differences in interactions among related versus unrelated
   mink.}},

Abstract = {{Caste determination in social insects has long been considered to
   exemplify socially mediated phenotypic plasticity: young larvae can
   develop into queens or workers depending on the social environment.
   However, recent studies have challenged this view by showing that, in
   some species, larval development can be biased early by factors such as
   larval genotype. We analyzed this issue in the ant species Aphaenogaster
   senilis. First, we found that the probability that a larva develops into
   a queen or a worker varies consistently among colonies. Next, we
   conducted a cross-fostering experiment in which larvae from colonies
   with relatively low queen production were transferred to colonies with
   relatively high queen production and vice versa. The results show a
   strong significant interaction between early determination and worker
   control of larval caste fate. Therefore, our study shows that socially
   mediated phenotypic plasticity is limited by processes occurring at an
   early developmental stage that possibly include direct or indirect
   genetic effects or non-genetic maternal effects.}},

Abstract = {{In many taxa there is considerable intraspecific variation in life
   history strategies from within a single population, reflecting
   alternative routes through which organisms can achieve successful
   reproduction. Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (Linnaeus) show some of the
   greatest within-population variability in life history strategies
   amongst vertebrates, with multiple discrete male and female life
   histories co-existing and interbreeding on many spawning grounds,
   although the effect of the various combinations of life histories on
   offspring traits remains unknown. Using crosses of wild fish we show
   here that the life history strategy of both parents was significantly
   associated with a range of offspring traits. Mothers that had spent
   longer at sea (2 versus 1 year) produced offspring that were heavier,
   longer and in better condition at the time of first feeding. However,
   these relationships disappeared shortly after fry had begun feeding
   exogenously. At this stage, the juvenile rearing environment (i.e. time
   spent in fresh water as juveniles) of the mother was a better predictor
   of offspring traits, with mothers that were faster to develop in fresh
   water (migrating to sea after two rather than three years of age)
   producing offspring that had higher maximal metabolic rates, aerobic
   scopes, and that grew faster. Faster developing fathers (1 year old
   sneaker males) tended to produce offspring that had higher maximal
   metabolic rates, were in better body condition and grew faster. The
   results suggest that both genetic effects and those related to parental
   early and late life history contribute to offspring traits.}},

Title = {{Comparison of designs for estimating genetic parameters and obtaining
   response to selection for social interaction traits in aquaculture}},
Journal = {{AQUACULTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{451}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals may affect individual productivity
   and welfare in aquaculture. Since social effects may have a genetic
   component, known as an indirect genetic effect (IGE), genetic selection
   may be a promising tool to simultaneously improve welfare and
   productivity in aquaculture. Here we compare two experimental designs
   that have been previously proposed for the genetic improvement of
   socially affected traits. We used stochastic simulations to compare a
   design where each group consisted of members of two families (2-FAM)
   with a design where each group consisted of members of three families
   (3-FAM). The 2-FAM and 3-FAM designs were compared using an equal number
   of groups (96 groups). The group size, i.e., number of individuals
   within each group, was either 30 or 60 individuals. Both designs were
   compared for the precision of estimated direct and social genetic
   parameters and for response to selection, either with or without a
   restriction on the rate of inbreeding. Four different schemes with a low
   variance (heritability for social effects or h(S)(2)=0.1), a moderate
   variance (h(S)(2) = 0.3), or a high variance (h(S)(2) = 0.5) of the
   social genetic effects, and a negative correlation between direct and
   social genetic effects (rA(D, S) = -0.6) were compared. The negative
   rAD, S indicates competition between group mates. Differences in
   precision of estimated genetic parameters between both designs were
   small. At low h(S)(2) and group size of 30, the 2-FAM design was
   superior with respect to precision of social additive genetic variance.
   When the social genetic variance was small, a larger group size, e.g. 60
   is recommended. The 2-FAM design resulted in a higher accuracy of
   selection for social and total genetic effects, but also in a higher
   rate of inbreeding compared to the 3-FAM design. When the rate of
   inbreeding was restricted to similar to 2\%, the total response to
   selection was significantly higher for the 3-FAM design. In conclusion,
   the 2-FAM and 3-FAM designs differ little in accuracy of the direct and
   social genetic parameter estimates, while the 3-FAM design is superior
   with respect to the response to selection at a fixed rate of inbreeding.
   This study is particularly important for making decisions regarding
   experimental design when breeding for social genetic effects in
   aquaculture.
   Statement of relevance: Communal or family rearing with a large number
   of animals in a group is common practice in aquaculture. Large variation
   in body size, which may inflate competition for feed, is generally
   observed in the communal rearing tank. In addition, cannibalistic or
   aggressive behaviour is frequently observed in a large variety of fish
   species. So far, the issue is addressed by management measures, such as
   size grading, which may be labour intensive. Sustainable solutions
   through selective breeding have not been tested.
   Previous studies compared two experimental designs for social
   interaction traits; groups composed of two families (2-FAM) and three
   families (3-FAM) with groups composed at random and found that the 2-FAM
   and 3-FAM designs were better with respect to genetic parameter
   estimates than designs with groups composed at random. It is however
   still unknown whether the 2-FAM or the 3-FAM design is better. Previous
   studies did not consider the rate of inbreeding when studying the
   designs. This paper describes the results from a comparison of the two
   experimental designs for estimating genetic parameters and obtaining
   response to selection, taking into account the rate of inbreeding. As
   such, this paper should be of interest to a broad readership including
   those interested in aquaculture genetics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Increased maternal age at reproduction is often associated with
   decreased offspring performance in numerous species of plants and
   animals (including humans). Current evolutionary theory considers such
   maternal effect senescence as part of a unified process of reproductive
   senescence, which is under identical age-specific selective pressures to
   fertility. We offer a novel theoretical perspective by combining William
   Hamilton's evolutionary model for aging with a quantitative genetic
   model of indirect genetic effects. We demonstrate that fertility and
   maternal effect senescence are likely to experience different patterns
   of age-specific selection and thus can evolve to take divergent forms.
   Applied to neonatal survival, we find that selection for maternal
   effects is the product of age-specific fertility and Hamilton's
   age-specific force of selection for fertility. Population genetic models
   show that senescence for these maternal effects can evolve in the
   absence of reproductive or actuarial senescence; this implies that
   maternal effect aging is a fundamentally distinct demographic
   manifestation of the evolution of aging. However, brief periods of
   increasingly beneficial maternal effects can evolve when fertility
   increases with age faster than cumulative survival declines. This is
   most likely to occur early in life. Our integration of theory provides a
   general framework with which to model, measure, and compare the
   evolutionary determinants of the social manifestations of aging.
   Extension of our maternal effects model to other ecological and social
   contexts could provide important insights into the drivers of the
   astonishing diversity of lifespans and aging patterns observed among
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Debates about how coevolution of sexual traits and preferences might
   promote evolutionary diversification have permeated speciation research
   for over a century. Recent work demonstrates that the expression of such
   traits can be sensitive to variation in the social environment. Here, we
   examined social flexibility in a sexually selected male trait-cuticular
   hydrocarbon (CHC) profiles-in the field cricket Teleogryllus oceanicus
   and tested whether population genetic divergence predicts the extent or
   direction of social flexibility in allopatric populations. We
   manipulated male crickets' social environments during rearing and then
   characterized CHC profiles. CHC signatures varied considerably across
   populations and also in response to the social environment, but our
   prediction that increased social flexibility would be selected in more
   recently founded populations exposed to fluctuating demographic
   environments was unsupported. Furthermore, models examining the
   influence of drift and selection failed to support a role of sexual
   selection in driving population divergence in CHC profiles. Variation in
   social environments might alter the dynamics of sexual selection, but
   our results align with theoretical predictions that the role social
   flexibility plays in modulating evolutionary divergence depends
   critically on whether responses to variation in the social environment
   are homogeneous across populations, or whether gene by social
   environment interactions occur.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are the basis of social interactions
   among conspecifics, and can affect genetic variation of nonsocial and
   social traits. We used flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) of two
   phenotypically distinguishable populations to estimate genetic
   (co)variances and the effect of IGEs on three life-history traits:
   development time (DT), growth rate (GR), and pupal body mass (BM). We
   found that GR was strongly affected by social environment with IGEs
   accounting for 18\% of the heritable variation. We also discovered a
   sex-specific social effect: male ratio in a group significantly affected
   both GR and BM; that is, beetles grew larger and faster in male-biased
   social environments. Such sex-specific IGEs have not previously been
   demonstrated in a nonsocial insect. Our results show that beetles that
   achieve a higher BM do so via a slower GR in response to social
   environment. Existing models of evolution in age-structured or
   stage-structured populations do not account for IGEs of social cohorts.
   It is likely that such IGEs have played a key role in the evolution of
   developmental plasticity shown by Tenebrionid larvae in response to
   density. Our results document an important source of genetic variation
   for GR, often overlooked in life-history theory.}},

Abstract = {{Kin selection theory has always been explicitly genetic and has long
   been invoked to explain the evolution of the sterile worker caste in the
   social insects. However, sociogenomic studies of the evolution and
   genomic basis of social insect caste have been largely disconnected from
   kin selection theory and other related genetic theories of social
   evolution. Two previous population genetic models make testable
   predictions for patterns of sequence diversity for genes shaped
   indirectly by kin selection compared to genes shaped directly by natural
   selection, but there is some confusion in the literature regarding the
   predicted effects of kin selection and sex-limited expression on
   molecular evolution. We review the previous models and then use a simple
   parental effect model to clarify that the two factors, kin selection and
   sex-limited expression, are distinct and each has a separate effect on
   the expected patterns of molecular evolution. We further build on the
   previous models to show how categories of genes in social insect genomes
   with diverse combinations of fitness effects (direct, parental, sib, and
   offspring) and patterns of sex-limitation are predicted to evolve. We
   discuss how caste- and sex-specific transcriptomic profiling, coupled
   with population genomic data, can be used to identify different
   functional categories of genes and subsequently test whether observed
   patterns of molecular evolution fit theoretical predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Trait values of individuals are affected not only by their genetic
   makeup, but also by environmental factors and interactions with other
   individuals. The heritable effect of an individual on the trait values
   of other individuals it interacts with is known as an indirect genetic
   effect (IGE). Such IGEs may affect response to selection. Fish selected
   for high growth rate, for example, have been shown to be more aggressive
   and competitive, which may reduce the observed response in growth rate.
   The main objective of this study is to quantify the genetic and
   non-genetic indirect effects for harvest weight in the GIFT strain of
   Nile tilapia. A total of 6330 fish with harvest weight information were
   used to estimate genetic and non-genetic parameters. A bivariate
   analysis of harvest weight and survival was conducted by fitting
   different mixed models to investigate the presence of IGEs and other
   non-genetic effects. The full set of genetic parameters could not be
   estimated simultaneously with the inclusion of maternal common
   environmental effects. A confounding between maternal common
   environmental effects and direct genetic effects resulted from the
   mating strategy, where one sire was mated to only one or two dams. A 1
   male to 2 females mating design is common in aquaculture, but it has
   limited power to estimate genetic parameters. Models without maternal
   common environmental effects showed significant IGE on harvest weight,
   which contributed 48\% of total heritable variance. Models with maternal
   common environmental effects suggested the presence of IGE. The
   direct-indirect genetic correlation for harvest weight was negative
   (-0.38 +/- 0.19), indicating that traditional selection, if performed in
   an environment where the fish have to compete with each other for the
   resources, will increase competition. A strongly negative genetic
   correlation between direct effects on survival and indirect effects on
   harvest weight (-0.79 +/- 0.30) showed that individuals with better
   genes for survival suppressed growth rate of their social partners. Our
   results suggest that heritable competitive interactions affect harvest
   weight in Nile tilapia. Hence, breeding schemes may need to be adapted
   to avoid an increase in aggressiveness due to selection for growth rate
   in a competitive environment. Further studies are required to
   investigate the relevance of IGE and its implications on different
   systems of commercial aquaculture production. (C) 2015 The Authors.

   Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei at low rearing density}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Our aim was to estimate the genetic parameters for the
   direct genetic effect (DGE) and indirect genetic effects (IGE) on adult
   body weight in the Pacific white shrimp. IGE is the heritable effect of
   an individual on the trait values of its group mates.
   Methods: To examine IGE on body weight, 4725 shrimp from 105 tagged
   families were tested in multiple small test groups (MSTG). Each family
   was separated into three groups (15 shrimp per group) that were randomly
   assigned to 105 concrete tanks with shrimp from two other families. To
   estimate breeding values, one large test group (OLTG) in a 300 m(2)
   circular concrete tank was used for the communal rearing of 8398
   individuals from 105 families. Body weight was measured after a
   growth-test period of more than 200 days. Variance components for body
   weight in the MSTG programs were estimated using an animal model
   excluding or including IGE whereas variance components in the OLTG
   programs were estimated using a conventional animal model that included
   only DGE. The correlation of DGE between MSTG and OLTG programs was
   estimated by a two-trait animal model that included or excluded IGE.
   Results: Heritability estimates for body weight from the conventional
   animal model in MSTG and OLTG programs were 0.26 +/- 0.13 and 0.40 +/-
   0.06, respectively. The log likelihood ratio test revealed significant
   IGE on body weight. Total heritable variance was the sum of direct
   genetic variance (43.5 \%), direct-indirect genetic covariance (2.1 \%),
   and indirect genetic variance (54.4 \%). It represented 73 \% of the
   phenotypic variance and was more than two-fold greater than that (32 \%)
   obtained by using a classical heritability model for body weight.
   Correlations of DGE on body weight between MSTG and OLTG programs were
   intermediate regardless of whether IGE were included or not in the
   model.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that social interactions contributed to
   a large part of the heritable variation in body weight. Small and
   non-significant direct-indirect genetic correlations implied that
   neutral or slightly cooperative heritable interactions, rather than
   competition, were dominant in this population but this may be due to the
   low rearing density.}},

Title = {{Male birch catkin bugs vary copula duration to invest more in matings
   with novel females}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{161-166}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recent developments in the study of mating behaviour have emphasized the
   importance of strategic investment of limited reproductive resources.
   However, in many cases it can be difficult to interpret traits such as
   copula duration, because they are interacting phenotypes that ultimately
   depend upon both the male and female mating partner, and the sexes may
   frequently disagree over the optimal outcome. Here we report the results
   of experiments designed to establish which sex controls copula duration
   in the birch catkin bug, Kleidocerys resedae, and to test for strategic
   investment by the controlling sex. First, we found that matings of
   field-caught individuals were relatively short, but that copula duration
   increased following a period of sexual isolation, reaching a maximum
   after 2 days. However, copula duration was again shorter in re-pairings
   of the same individuals 1 h after their first mating. Because these
   results could be interpreted as a response to sexual isolation by either
   sex, we next investigated whether copula duration is under male or
   female control in this species. Experimental pairings between males and
   females isolated for 1 h or 48 h in all four possible combinations
   revealed that copula duration depended strongly on the period of male
   but not of female sexual isolation, implying that this trait is under
   male control. Finally, if males mated once were re-paired after 1 h with
   either the same or a novel (but still recently mated) female, we found
   that they mated for significantly longer with the latter. Collectively,
   our results imply that male birch catkin bugs in nature are frequently
   time-, sperm- or seminal fluid-limited, and that, as predicted by
   theory, they strategically allocate more of their mating effort and
   ejaculate reserves to novel females, a form of (cryptic) male mate
   choice. (C) 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{The caste fate of developing female honey bee larvae is strictly
   socially regulated by adult nurse workers. As a result of this social
   regulation, nurse-expressed genes as well as larval-expressed genes may
   affect caste expression and evolution. We used a novel transcriptomic
   approach to identify genes with putative direct and indirect effects on
   honey bee caste development, and we subsequently studied the relative
   rates of molecular evolution at these caste-associated genes. We
   experimentally induced the production of new queens by removing the
   current colony queen, and we used RNA sequencing to study the gene
   expression profiles of both developing larvae and their caregiving
   nurses before and after queen removal. By comparing the gene expression
   profiles of queen-destined versus worker-destined larvae as well as
   nurses observed feeding these two types of larvae, we identified larval
   and nurse genes associated with caste development. Of 950 differentially
   expressed genes associated with caste, 82\% were expressed in larvae
   with putative direct effects on larval caste, and 18\% were expressed in
   nurses with putative indirect effects on caste. Estimated selection
   coefficients suggest that both nurse and larval genes putatively
   associated with caste are rapidly evolving, especially those genes
   associated with worker development. Altogether, our results suggest that
   indirect effect genes play important roles in both the expression and
   evolution of socially influenced traits such as caste.}},

Abstract = {{1. While competition is recognized as a major factor responsible for
   plant community dynamics, the genetics of intra- and interspecific
   competitive ability of a target species (i.e. level of intra-population
   genetic variation, identity of phenotypic traits under selection and
   genetic bases) still deserves a deeper investigation at the local
   spatial scale by considering both numerous genotypes and several
   interacting species.
   2. In this study, we tested whether the genetics of competitive response
   and effect in Arabidopsis thaliana was dependent on the competitive
   environment at both the intraspecific and interspecific levels. We used
   a mapping population of 48 accessions (i) that maximize the genetic
   diversity of a local population of A.thaliana and (ii) that have been
   genotyped for 168503 single nucleotide polymorphisms.
   3. In a common garden experiment, those 48 accessions were grown in six
   competitive environments: the absence of competition, intraspecific
   competition and interspecific competition with four species frequently
   associated with A.thaliana in natural plant communities (i.e. Poa annua,
   Stellaria media, Trifolium repens and Veronica arvensis). A suite of
   nine phenotypic traits, including a proxy of fitness, were scored on
   each target A.thaliana plant and the above-ground dry biomass of its
   corresponding competitor was estimated.
   4. We first showed that crossing reaction norms of competitive response
   (A.thaliana performance) and effect (competitor biomass) might promote
   maintenance of genetic variation in a local population of A.thaliana and
   species coexistence at a fine spatial scale. By estimating genotypic
   gradients of selection, we then demonstrated that the optimal phenotypic
   strategies in response to competition depend on the identity of the
   competitor species. Finally, a genomewide association mapping approach
   highlighted that genomic regions associated with direct genetic effects

   genomic regions associated with interspecific indirect genetic effects.
   5. While a first step, this study highlighted the power of adding
   ecology to genomics in A.thaliana to identify genetic bases underlying
   micro-geographic adaptation to competition. Next-generation sequencing
   technologies will undoubtedly facilitate the discovery of molecular and
   genetic mechanisms underlying competitive ability in other plant
   species, and thereby the prediction of evolutionary trajectories of

   Recent studies have investigated how the phenotypic composition of

   selection can drive phenotypic covariance among interacting individuals.
   However, we argue that these questions are rarely studied together. We
   present a unified framework to address this gap, and discuss how group
   phenotypic composition (GPC) can impact on processes ranging from
   individual fitness to population demography. By emphasising the breadth

Title = {{Predicting direct and indirect breeding values for survival time in
   laying hens using repeated measures}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{47}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Minimizing bird losses is important in the commercial layer
   industry. Selection against mortality is challenging because
   heritability is low, censoring is high, and individual survival depends
   on social interactions among cage members. With cannibalism, mortality
   depends not only on an individual's own genes (direct genetic effects;
   DGE) but also on genes of its cage mates (indirect genetic effects;
   IGE). To date, studies using DGE-IGE models have focussed on survival
   time but their shortcomings are that censored records were considered as
   exact lengths of life and models assumed that IGE were continuously
   expressed by all cage members even after death. However, since dead
   animals no longer express IGE, IGE should ideally be time-dependent in
   the model. Neglecting censoring and timing of IGE expression may reduce
   accuracy of estimated breeding values (EBV). Thus, our aim was to
   improve prediction of breeding values for survival time in layers that
   present cannibalism.
   Methods: We considered four DGE-IGE models to predict survival time in
   layers. One model was an analysis of survival time and the three others
   treated survival in consecutive months as a repeated binomial trait
   (repeated measures models). We also tested whether EBV were improved by
   including timing of IGE expression in the analyses. Approximate EBV
   accuracies were calculated by cross-validation. The models were fitted
   to survival data on two purebred White Leghorn layer lines W1 and WB,
   each having monthly survival records over 13 months.
   Results: Including the timing of IGE expression in the DGE-IGE model
   reduced EBV accuracy compared to analysing survival time. EBV accuracy
   was higher when repeated measures models were used. However, there was
   no universal best model. Using repeated measures instead of analysing
   survival time increased EBV accuracy by 10 to 21 and 2 to 12 \% for W1
   and WB, respectively. We showed how EBV and variance components
   estimated with repeated measures models can be translated into survival
   time.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that prediction of breeding values for
   survival time in laying hens can be improved using repeated measures
   models. This is an important result since more accurate EBV contribute
   to higher rates of genetic gain.}},

Abstract = {{Gardner (2015) recently developed a model of a `Genetical Theory of
   Multilevel Selection, which is a thoughtfully developed, but flawed
   model. The model's flaws appear to be symptomatic of common
   misunderstandings of the multi level selection (MLS) literature and the
   recent quantitative genetic literature. I use Gardner's model as a guide
   for highlighting how the MLS literature can address the misconceptions
   found in his model, and the kin selection literature in general. I
   discuss research on the efficacy of group selection, the roll of
   indirect genetic effects in affecting the response to selection and the
   heritability of group-level traits. I also discuss why the Price
   multilevel partition should not be used to partition MLS, and why
   contextual analysis and, by association, direct fitness are appropriate
   for partitioning MLS. Finally, I discuss conceptual issues around
   questions concerning the level at which fitness is measured, the units
   of selection, and I present a brief outline of a model of selection in
   class-structured populations. I argue that the results derived from the
   MLS research tradition can inform kin selection research and models, and
   provide insights that will allow researchers to avoid conceptual flaws
   such as those seen in the Gardner model.}},

Abstract = {{Group housing of gestating sows has implications for reproductive
   performance due to detrimental interactions between sows within groups.
   Reproductive records (n = 10,748) were obtained for 8,444 pedigreed
   nucleus sows housed in a single facility, formed into 1,827 static
   groups during gestation. Only data from complete groups were used to
   estimate genetic parameters for total born (TB), number born alive
   (NBA), and gestation length (GL) and to compare models extended to
   account for group effects. Censored data for sows which did not farrow
   (0.8\% of records) were augmented with biologically meaningful values.
   Group sizes ranged from 2 to 10, in pens designed to hold 4, 8, or 10
   sows per pen. Sows were grouped by parity, line, and mating date after d
   35 of pregnancy. Heritability estimates were generally constant across
   all model alternatives at 0.11 +/- 0.02 for TB and NBA and 0.32 +/- 0.03
   for GL. However, models for all traits were significantly (P < 0.05)
   improved through inclusion of terms for nongenetic group and social
   genetic effects (SGE). Group effects were no longer significant in
   models containing both terms. The proportional contributions of SGE
   (s(2)) to phenotypic variances were very low (<= 0.002 across traits),
   but their contributions to calculated total genetic variance (T-2) were
   significant. The differences between h(2) and T-2 ranged between 3 and
   5\% under simple models, increasing to 8 to 14\% in models accounting
   for both covariances between additive direct (A) and SGE and the effects
   of varying group size on the magnitude of estimates for SGE. Estimates
   of covariance between A and SGE were sensitive to the modeling of
   dilution factors for group size. The models of best fit for litter size
   traits used a customized dilution based on sows/pen relative to the
   maximum sows/pen. The best model supported a reduction in SGE with
   increased space per sow, independent of maximum group size, and no
   significant correlation between A and SGE. The latter is expected if A
   and SGE reflect different trait complexes. It is suggested that the SGE
   estimated for reproductive traits represented the expression of an
   unobserved phenotype, such as sow aggression, of an individual on its
   pen mates. Further investigation into the use of competitive effects
   models for genetic evaluation of reproductive traits for grouphoused
   sows could be considered a strategy to improve welfare and performance
   of group-housed sows.}},

Volume = {{282}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypes expressed in a social context are not only a function of the
   individual, but can also be shaped by the phenotypes of social partners.
   These social effects may play a major role in the evolution of
   cooperative breeding if social partners differ in the quality of care
   they provide and if individual carers adjust their effort in relation to
   that of other carers. When applying social effects models to wild study
   systems, it is also important to explore sources of individual
   plasticity that could masquerade as social effects. We studied offspring
   provisioning rates of parents and helpers in a wild population of
   long-tailed tits Aegithalos caudatus using a quantitative genetic
   framework to identify these social effects and partition them into
   genetic, permanent environment and current environment components.
   Controlling for other effects, individuals were consistent in their
   provisioning effort at a given nest, but adjusted their effort based on
   who was in their social group, indicating the presence of social
   effects. However, these social effects differed between years and social
   contexts, indicating a current environment effect, rather than
   indicating a genetic or permanent environment effect. While this study
   reveals the importance of examining environmental and genetic sources of
   social effects, the framework we present is entirely general, enabling a
   greater understanding of potentially important social effects within any
   ecological population.}},

Abstract = {{Males in polygamous mating systems may inadvertently transmit
   information regarding their mating preferences to bystanding sexual
   competitors, thereby permitting bystanders to use this information to
   enhance their own mating success by copying the mate choice of
   signallers. If males are at risk of having their mate choice copied and
   consequently face a higher risk of sexual competition, then selection
   should favour males that reduce conspicuous mating behaviours in the
   presence of an audience of sexual competitors. In the current study, we
   used the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a species that
   exhibits alternative male mating tactics, to test this sexual
   competition avoidance hypothesis and the predictions that males would
   decrease their overall mating effort and exhibit fewer conspicuous
   courtship displays relative to more inconspicuous sneak mating attempts
   in the presence of either one or two sexual rivals compared to the
   absence of any audience. Male guppies significantly reduced their
   overall mating effort in the presence of increasing numbers of rival
   audience males. This was reflected in similar monotonic decreases in the
   frequencies of courtship displays and sneak mating attempts and in the
   proportional use of courtship displays (relative to sneak mating
   attempts) across treatments. These findings are consistent with the
   sexual competition avoidance hypothesis. Our novel results contribute to
   an increasing body of knowledge showing that the social environment can
   influence the mating effort and mating decisions of individuals and thus
   have important implications for sexual selection and evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Coexistence of alternative color morphs may happen if each morph is
   better adapted to a particular habitat, or if all co-occur in the same
   habitat but perform differently. Here, we show that competing color
   morphs of a raptor species are spatially segregated by forming permanent
   same-color clusters. Alternative morphs adopt different breeding
   strategies; one behaving highly colonially whereas the other being more
   territorial, yet the relative advantages of each strategy depends on
   environmental conditions.It has been proposed that niche and behavioral
   processes may promote the coexistence of alternative color morphs in
   discrete areas. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that alternative
   melanin-based phenotypes perform differently when co-occurring in
   breeding areas. We assessed the influence of microhabitat and social
   drivers on both the resulting nest-site distribution and the variation
   in reproductive success of interacting phenotypes of the colonial, color
   polymorphic Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae). We combined measures of
   social, behavioral, and breeding performance, as well as environmental
   variables under a spatially explicit approach. We found that alternative
   morphs were segregated over suitable habitats by forming permanent
   same-color clusters. This pattern was mainly due to social dominance
   relationships; the pale morph, which was less dominant but more
   aggressive than the dark morph, settled close to pale conspecifics but
   far from dark ones. This segregation was also influenced by the settling
   of dark morph males in less dense areas and at higher altitudes than
   pale ones. Although the timing of reproduction did not differ between
   morphs, the dark morph attained higher reproductive output during the
   study years. The evidence suggests that pale and dark falcons adopt
   different breeding strategies, with pale morphs behaving highly
   colonially and dark morphs being more territorial, yet their relative
   advantages depend on the environmental conditions. We suggest that
   balancing selection may act on such competitive asymmetries, likely
   contributing to the evolutionary stability and long-term maintenance of
   color polymorphism in wild populations.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one
   individual alter the expression of traits in social partners. Previous
   studies focused on the evolutionary consequences and evolutionary
   dynamics of IGEs, using equilibrium solutions to predict phenotypes in
   subsequent generations. However, whether or not such steady states may
   be reached may depend on the dynamics of interactions themselves.
   Results
   In our study, we focus on the dynamics of social interactions and
   indirect genetic effects and investigate how they modify phenotypes over
   time. Unlike previous IGE studies, we do not analyse evolutionary
   dynamics; rather we consider within-individual phenotypic changes, also
   referred to as phenotypic plasticity. We analyse iterative interactions,
   when individuals interact in a series of discontinuous events, and
   investigate the stability of steady state solutions and the dependence
   on model parameters, such as population size, strength, and the nature
   of interactions. We show that for interactions where a feedback loop
   occurs, the possible parameter space of interaction strength is fairly
   limited, affecting the evolutionary consequences of IGEs. We discuss the
   implications of our results for current IGE model predictions and their
   limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Parents of many species provision their young, and the extent of
   parental provisioning constitutes a major component of the offspring's
   social environment. Thus, a change in parental provisioning can alter
   selection on offspring, resulting in the coevolution of parental and
   offspring traits. Although this reasoning is central to our evolutionary
   understanding of family life, there is little direct evidence that
   selection by parents causes evolutionary change in their offspring. Here
   we use experimental evolution to examine how populations of burying
   beetles adapt to a change in posthatching parental provisioning. We
   measured the performance of larvae descended from lab populations that
   had been maintained with and without posthatching parental care (Full
   Care and No Care populations). We found that adaptation to the absence
   of posthatching care led to rapid and consistent changes in larval
   survival in the absence of care. Specifically, larvae from No Care
   populations had higher survival in the absence of care than larvae from
   Full Care populations. Other measures of larval performance, such as the
   ability of larvae to consume a breeding carcass and larval mass at
   dispersal, did not differ between the Full Care and No Care populations.
   Nevertheless, our results show that populations can adapt rapidly to a
   change in the extent of parental care and that experimental evolution
   can be used to study such adaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Populations from the same species may be differentiated across
   contrasting environments, potentially affecting reproductive isolation
   among them. When such populations meet in a novel common environment,
   this isolation may be modified by biotic or abiotic factors. Curiously,
   the latter have been overlooked. We filled this gap by performing
   experimental evolution of three replicates of two populations of
   Drosophila subobscura adapting to a common laboratorial environment, and
   simulated encounters at three time points during this process. Previous
   studies showed that these populations were highly differentiated for
   several life-history traits and chromosomal inversions. First, we show
   initial differentiation for some mating traits, such as assortative
   mating and male mating rate, but not others (e.g., female mating
   latency). Mating frequency increased during experimental evolution in
   both sets of populations. The assortative mating found in one population
   remained constant throughout the adaptation process, while
   disassortative mating of the other population diminished across
   generations. Additionally, differences in male mating rate were
   sustained across generations. This study shows that mating behavior
   evolves rapidly in response to adaptation to a common abiotic
   environment, although with a complex pattern that does not correspond to
   the quick convergence seen for life-history traits.}},

Abstract = {{Existing insight suggests that maternal effects have a substantial
   impact on evolution, yet these predictions assume that maternal effects
   themselves are evolutionarily constant. Hence, it is poorly understood
   how natural selection shapes maternal effects in different ecological
   circumstances. To overcome this, the current study derives an
   evolutionary model of maternal effects in a quantitative genetics
   context. In constant environments, we show that maternal effects evolve
   to slight negative values that result in a reduction of the phenotypic
   variance (canalization). By contrast, in populations experiencing abrupt
   change, maternal effects transiently evolve to positive values for many
   generations, facilitating the transmission of beneficial maternal
   phenotypes to offspring. In periodically fluctuating environments,
   maternal effects evolve according to the autocorrelation between
   maternal and offspring environments, favoring positive maternal effects
   when change is slow, and negative maternal effects when change is rapid.
   Generally, the strongest maternal effects occur for traits that
   experience very strong selection and for which plasticity is severely
   constrained. By contrast, for traits experiencing weak selection,
   phenotypic plasticity enhances the evolutionary scope of maternal
   effects, although maternal effects attain much smaller values
   throughout. As weak selection is common, finding substantial maternal
   influences on offspring phenotypes may be more challenging than
   anticipated.}},

Abstract = {{The social environment may be a key mediator of selection that operates
   on animals. In many cases, individuals may experience selection not only
   as a function of their phenotype, but also as a function of the
   interaction between their phenotype and the phenotypes of the
   conspecifics they associate with. For example, when animals settle after
   dispersal, individuals may benefit from arriving early, but, in many
   cases, these benefits will be affected by the arrival times of other
   individuals in their local environment. We integrated a recently
   described method for calculating assortativity on weighted networks,
   which is the correlation between an individual's phenotype and that of
   its associates, into an existing framework for measuring the magnitude
   of social selection operating on phenotypes. We applied this approach to
   large-scale data on social network structure and the timing of arrival
   into the breeding area over three years. We found that late-arriving
   individuals had a reduced probability of breeding. However, the
   probability of breeding was also influenced by individuals' social
   networks. Associating with late-arriving conspecifics increased the
   probability of successfully acquiring a breeding territory. Hence,
   social selection could offset the effects of nonsocial selection. Given
   parallel theoretical developments of the importance of local network
   structure on population processes, and increasing data being collected
   on social networks in free-living populations, the integration of these
   concepts could yield significant insights into social evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The consequences of sexual interactions extend beyond the simple
   production of offspring. These interactions typically entail direct
   effects on female fitness, but may also impact the life histories of
   later generations. Evaluating the cross-generational effects of sexual
   interactions provides insights into the dynamics of sexual selection and
   conflict. Such studies can elucidate whether offspring fitness optima
   diverge across sexes upon heightened levels of sexual interaction among
   parents. Here, we found that, in Drosophila melanogaster, components of
   reproductive success in females, but not males, were contingent on the
   nature of sexual interactions experienced by their mothers. In
   particular, maternal sexual interactions with non-sires enhanced female
   fecundity in the following generation. This highlights the importance of
   non-sire influences of sexual interactions on the expression of
   offspring life histories.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{602-610}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Sexual selection acting on small initial differences in mating signals
   and mate preferences can enhance signal-preference codivergence and
   reproductive isolation during speciation. However, the origin of initial
   differences in sexual traits remains unclear. We asked whether biotic
   environments, a source of variation in sexual traits, may provide a
   general solution to this problem. Specifically, we asked whether genetic
   variation in biotic environments provided by host plants can result in
   signal-preference phenotypic covariance in a host-specific,
   plant-feeding insect. We used a member of the Enchenopa binotata species
   complex of treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to assess patterns of
   variation in male mating signals and female mate preferences induced by
   genetic variation in host plants. We employed a novel implementation of
   a quantitative genetics method, rearing field-collected treehoppers on a
   sample of naturally occurring replicated host plant clone lines. We
   found remarkably high signal-preference covariance among host plant
   genotypes. Thus, genetic variation in biotic environments influences the
   sexual phenotypes of organisms living on those environments in a way
   that promotes assortative mating among environments. This consequence
   arises from conditions likely to be common in nature (phenotypic
   plasticity and variation in biotic environments). It therefore offers a
   general answer to how divergent sexual selection may begin.}},

   theory developed in behavioural ecology and quantitative genetics. The
   proposed emergent framework facilitates firm integration of social
   environments in adaptive research on phenotypic characters that vary

Abstract = {{Males can through their behavior (e.g., courtship feeding) exert an
   indirect effect on their partner's reproductive traits, such as the
   seasonal timing and size of her clutch. Evidence for such indirect
   (male) effect on reproduction is starting to accumulate. We quantify
   female and male effects on reproduction in the tawny owl Strix aluco
   using a hierarchical mixed model on data collected in 1978-2013. We find
   that differences between males explain 7 \% of the phenotypic variance
   in laying date (females 5 \%). In contrast, females have a clear (11 \%)
   effect on clutch size, whereas males have no effect. Based on
   multivariate hierarchical modeling, we find an individual-level
   correlation between the male-specific effect on laying date and his body
   mass (but not his plumage color or wing length). Heavy males may be able
   to affect their partner's seasonal timing of laying because of an
   advantage in providing courtship feeding prior to reproduction. Our
   findings illustrate that males can be an important determinant of
   variation in reproduction and that multivariate mixed models present a
   general approach to pinpoint which individual characteristics could be
   associated with such indirect effects.}},

Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 26}},
Abstract = {{Studies of the genetic basis and evolution of complex social behavior
   emphasize either conserved or novel genes. To begin to reconcile these
   perspectives, we studied how the evolutionary conservation of genes
   associated with social behavior depends on regulatory context, and
   whether genes associated with social behavior exist in distinct
   regulatory and evolutionary contexts. We identified modules of
   co-expressed genes associated with age-based division of labor between
   nurses and foragers in the ant Monomorium pharaonis, and we studied the
   relationship between molecular evolution, connectivity, and expression.
   Highly connected and expressed genes were more evolutionarily conserved,
   as expected. However, compared to the rest of the genome,
   forager-upregulated genes were much more highly connected and conserved,
   while nurse-upregulated genes were less connected and more
   evolutionarily labile. Our results indicate that the genetic
   architecture of social behavior includes both highly connected and
   conserved components as well as loosely connected and evolutionarily
   labile components.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to estimate covariance components for BW at
   270 d (BW270) and carcass and ham quality traits in heavy pigs using
   models accounting for social effects and to compare the ability of such
   models to fit the data relative to models ignoring social interactions.
   Phenotypic records were from 9,871 pigs sired by 293 purebred boars
   mated to 456 crossbred sows. Piglets were born and reared at the same
   farm and randomly assigned at 60 d of age to groups (6.1 pigs per group
   on average) housed in finishing pens, each having an area of 6 m(2). The
   average additive genetic relationship among group mates was 0.11. Pigs
   were slaughtered at 277 +/- 3 d of age and 169.7 +/- 13.9 kg BW in
   groups of nearly 70 animals each. Four univariate animal models were
   compared: a basic model (M1) including only direct additive genetic
   effects, a model (M2) with nonheritable social group (pen) effects in
   addition to effects in M1, a model (M3) accounting for litter effects in
   addition to M2, and a model (M4) accounting for social genetic effects
   in addition to effects in M3. Restricted maximum likelihood estimates of
   covariance components were obtained for BW270; carcass backfat depth;
   carcass lean meat content (CLM); iodine number (IOD); and linoleic acid
   content (LIA) of raw ham subcutaneous fat; subcutaneous fat depth in the
   proximity of semimembranosus muscle (SFD1) and quadriceps femoris muscle
   (SFD2); and linear scores for ham round shape (RS), subcutaneous fat
   (SF), and marbling. Likelihood ratio tests indicated that, for all
   traits, M2 fit the data better than M1 and that M3 was superior to M2
   except for SFD1 and SFD2. Model M4 was significantly better than M3 for
   BW270 (P < 0.001) and CLM, IOD, RS, and SF (P < 0.05). The contribution
   of social genetic effects to the total heritable variance was large for
   CLM and BW270, ranging from 33.2 to 35\%, whereas the one for ham
   quality traits ranged from 6.8 (RS) to 11.2\% (SF). Direct and social
   genetic effects on BW270 were uncorrelated, whereas there was a negative
   genetic covariance between direct and social effects on CLM, IOD, RS,
   and SF, which reduced the total heritable variance. This variance,
   measured relative to phenotypic variance, ranged from 21 (CLM) to 54\%
   (BW270). Results indicate that social genetic effects affect variation
   in traits relevant for heavy pigs used in dry-cured hams manufacturing.
   Such effects should be exploited and taken into account in design of
   breeding programs for heavy pigs.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{185}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{There is mounting evidence that inbreeding can have detrimental effects
   on the fitness of outbred individuals that interact with or depend on
   inbred individuals. However, little is currently known about the
   behavioral mechanisms by which interactions with inbred individuals
   induce fitness costs in outbred individuals. Here, we study effects of
   inbreeding on the behavioral dynamics of biparental cooperation in the
   burying beetle Nicrophorus vespilloides. To this end, we used a
   two-by-two factorial design, in which an inbred or outbred female was
   mated to an inbred or an outbred male and tested for effects on
   cooperation between male and female parents providing care for their
   joint offspring. We found no evidence that inbred parents provided less
   care than outbred parents. Nevertheless, partners of inbred parents
   increased the amount of care they provided, leading to overcompensation.
   Our study shows that inbreeding can have strong and complex effects on
   the behavioral dynamics of biparental cooperation and that these effects
   are mediated mainly through changes in the partner's behavior. We
   suggest that similar effects of inbreeding on outbred individuals may
   extend to other social contexts, such as cooperative breeding and
   mating.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are heritable effects of an individual
   on phenotypic values of others, and may result from social interactions.
   We determined the behavioural consequences of selection for IGEs for
   growth (IGEg) in pigs in a G x E treatment design. Pigs (n = 480) were
   selected for high versus low IGEg with a contrast of 14 g average daily
   gain and were housed in either barren or straw-enriched pens (n = 80).
   High IGEg pigs showed from 8 to 23 weeks age 40 \% less aggressive
   biting (P = 0.006), 27 \% less ear biting (P = 0.03), and 40 \% less
   biting on enrichment material (P = 0.005). High IGEg pigs had a lower
   tail damage score (high 2.0; low 2.2; P = 0.004), and consumed 30 \%
   less jute sacks (P = 0.002). Selection on high IGEg reduced biting
   behaviours additive to the, generally much larger, effects of
   straw-bedding (P < 0.01), with no G x E interactions. These results show
   opportunities to reduce harmful biting behaviours in pigs.}},

Abstract = {{The social complexity that characterizes the eusocial insects strongly
   affects all aspects of social insect life, including the molecular and
   evolutionary genetic basis of social insect traits. Quantitative genetic
   theory and empirical approaches have been developed over the past 60
   years specifically to study the genetic implications of social
   interactions. Surprisingly, given the obvious biological importance of
   social interactions in social insects, this research tradition has been
   and continues to be widely overlooked throughout the social insect
   literature, including in recent sociogenomic studies focused on
   understanding the molecular underpinnings of social life. Instead, the
   overwhelming majority of social insect genetic research has relied on
   conventional genetic approaches developed for solitary organisms focused
   on the one-to-one association of an individual's genes to its own
   traits. I survey social insect studies that conclusively demonstrate the
   importance of indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which arise from social
   interactions, for social insect trait expression and evolution. I
   explain why these genetically based social effects are expected to be
   ubiquitous in social insects and I explain the relevance of the IGE
   framework, originally developed within quantitative genetics, for
   molecular genetic studies of social insect traits such as behaviour and
   caste. I discuss the problems of ignoring IGEs and relying solely on
   conventional direct genetic effect approaches. Finally, I discuss the
   strong potential of using the IGE approach and other more
   systems-level-focused approaches to complement conventional reductionist
   approaches in elucidating the genetic basis of social insect trait
   expression and evolution.}},

Title = {{An evolutionary perspective on conflict and compensation in
   physiological and functional traits}},
Journal = {{CURRENT ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{755-767}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Physiological and functional traits, especially those related to
   behavior and whole-organism performance capacities, are subject to a
   variety of both parallel and opposing natural and sexual selection
   pressures. These selection pressures show considerable interspecific
   variation, shaping contemporary behavioral and functional diversity, but
   the form and intensity of selection on physiological and functional
   traits can also vary intraspecifically. The same suites of traits can
   experience quite different selection pressures, depending on the sex or
   age of a given individual, as well as the presence and nature of
   alternative reproductive strategies and tactics. These inter-and
   intra-locus genetic conflicts have potentially important consequences
   for the evolutionary trajectories of traits subject to them.
   Consequently, any intraspecific conflicts which could displace traits
   from their selective optima in certain classes of individuals relative
   to others are expected to result in selection for mechanisms to
   compensate for deviation from those optima. Such conflicts include
   interlocus sexual conflict, intralocus sexual conflict, and interacting
   phenotypes, as well as conflict within a sex. In this paper, we consider
   the evidence for, and implications of, such conflicts for physiological
   and functional traits in diverse taxa, including both vertebrates and
   invertebrates, and evaluate the various mechanisms, ranging from
   behavioral and mechanical to energetic and genetic, enabling
   compensation. We also discuss how pre- and post-mating conflicts, as
   well as interacting phenotypes, might affect the evolution of behavior
   and physiological and functional traits. Investigators that seek to
   understand the links among behavior, morphology, physiology, and
   function should consider such conflicts.}},

Title = {{Methods to address poultry robustness and welfare issues through
   breeding and associated ethical considerations}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{As consumers and society in general become more aware of ethical and
   moral dilemmas associated with intensive rearing systems, pressure is
   put on the animal and poultry industries to adopt alternative forms of
   housing. This presents challenges especially regarding managing
   competitive social interactions between animals. However, selective
   breeding programs are rapidly advancing, enhanced by both genomics and
   new quantitative genetic theory that offer potential solutions by
   improving adaptation of the bird to existing and proposed production
   environments. The outcomes of adaptation could lead to improvement of
   animal welfare by increasing fitness of the animal for the given
   environments, which might lead to increased contentment and decreased
   distress of birds in those systems. Genomic selection, based on dense
   genetic markers, will allow for more rapid improvement of traits that
   are expensive or difficult to measure, or have a low heritability, such
   as pecking, cannibalism, robustness, mortality, leg score, bone
   strength, disease resistance, and thus has the potential to address many
   poultry welfare concerns. Recently selection programs to include social
   effects, known as associative or indirect genetic effects (IGEs), have
   received much attention. Group, kin, multi-level, and multi-trait
   selection including IGEs have all been shown to be highly effective in
   reducing mortality while increasing productivity of poultry layers and
   reduce or eliminate the need for beak trimming. Multi-level selection
   was shown to increases robustness as indicated by the greater ability of
   birds to cope with stressors. Kin selection has been shown to be easy to
   implement and improve both productivity and animal well-being.
   Management practices and rearing conditions employed for domestic animal
   production will continue to change based on ethical and scientific
   results. However, the animal breeding tools necessary to provide an
   animal that is best adapted to these changing conditions are readily
   available and should be used, which will ultimately lead to the best
   possible outcomes for all impacted.}},

   and productivity in livestock}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN GENETICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Social interactions between individuals living in a group can have both
   positive and negative effects on welfare, productivity, and health of
   these individuals. Negative effects of social interactions in livestock
   are easier to observe than positive effects. For example, laying hens
   may develop feather pecking, which can cause mortality due to
   cannibalism, and pigs may develop tail biting or excessive aggression.
   Several studies have shown that social interactions affect the genetic
   variation in a trait. Genetic improvement of socially-affected traits,
   however, has proven to be difficult until relatively recently. The use
   of classical selection methods, like individual selection, may result in
   selection responses opposite to expected, because these methods neglect
   the effect of an individual on its group mates (social genetic effects).
   It has become clear that improvement of socially-affected traits
   requires selection methods that take into account not only the direct
   effect of an individual on its own phenotype but also the social genetic
   effects, also known as indirect genetic effects, of an individual on the
   phenotypes of its group mates. Here, we review the theoretical and
   empirical work on social genetic effects, with a focus on livestock.
   First, we present the theory of social genetic effects. Subsequently, we
   evaluate the evidence for social genetic effects in livestock and other
   species, by reviewing estimates of genetic parameters for direct and
   social genetic effects. Then we describe the results of different
   selection experiments. Finally, we discuss issues concerning the
   implementation of social genetic effects in livestock breeding programs.
   This review demonstrates that selection for socially-affected traits,
   using methods that target both the direct and social genetic effects, is
   a promising, but sometimes difficult to use in practice, tool to
   simultaneously improve production and welfare in livestock.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Together with the avoidance of any negative impact of inbreeding,
   preservation of genetic variability for life-history traits that could
   undergo future selective pressure is a major issue in endangered species
   management programmes. However, most of these programmes ignore that,
   apart from the direct action of genes on such traits, parents, as
   contributors of offspring environment, can influence offspring
   performance through indirect parental effects (when parental genotype
   and phenotype exerts environmental influences on offspring phenotype
   independently of additive genetic effects). Using quantitative genetic
   models, we estimated the additive genetic variance for juvenile survival
   in a population of the endangered Cuvier's gazelle kept in captivity
   since 1975. The dataset analyzed included performance recording for 700
   calves and a total pedigree of 740 individuals. Results indicated that
   in this population juvenile survival harbors significant additive
   genetic variance. The estimates of heritability obtained were in general
   moderate (0.115-0.457) and not affected by the inclusion of inbreeding
   in the models. Maternal genetic contribution to juvenile survival seems
   to be of major importance in this gazelle's population as well. Indirect
   genetic and indirect environmental effects assigned to mothers (i.e.,
   maternal genetic and maternal permanent environmental effects) roughly
   explain a quarter of the total variance estimated for the trait
   analyzed. These findings have major evolutionary consequences for the
   species as show that offspring phenotypes can evolve strictly through
   changes in the environment provided by mothers. They are also relevant
   for the captive breeding programme of the species. To take into account,
   the contribution that mothers have on offspring phenotype through
   indirect genetic effects when designing pairing strategies might serve
   to identify those females with better ability to recruit, and,
   additionally, to predict reliable responses to selection in the captive
   population.}},

Title = {{Selection Based on Indirect Genetic Effects for Growth, Environmental
   Enrichment and Coping Style Affect the Immune Status of Pigs}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{Pigs living in intensive husbandry systems may experience both acute and
   chronic stress through standard management procedures and limitations in
   their physical and social environment, which may have implications for
   their immune status. Here, the effect of a new breeding method where
   pigs were selected on their heritable influence on their pen mates'
   growth, and environmental enrichment on the immune status of pigs was
   investigated. Hereto, 240 pigs with a relatively positive genetic effect
   on the growth of their pen mates (+SBV) and 240 pigs with a relatively
   negative genetic effect on the growth of their pen mates (-SBV) were
   housed in barren or straw-enriched pens from 4 to 23 weeks of age (n =
   80 pens in total). A blood sample was taken from the pigs before, three
   days after a 24 h regrouping test, and at week 22. In addition, effects
   of coping style, as assessed in a backtest, and gender were also
   investigated. Mainly, +SBV were found to have lower leukocyte,
   lymphocyte and haptoglobin concentrations than -SBV pigs. Enriched
   housed pigs had a lower neutrophil to lymphocyte (N:L) ratio and lower
   haptoglobin concentrations, but had higher antibody titers specific for
   Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (KLH) than barren housed pigs. No interactions
   were found between SBV class and housing. Furthermore, pigs with a
   proactive coping style had higher alternative complement activity and,
   in the enriched pens, higher antibody titers specific for KLH than pigs
   with a reactive coping style. Lastly, females tended to have lower
   leukocyte, but higher haptoglobin concentrations than castrated males.
   Overall, these results suggest that +SBV pigs and enriched housed pigs
   were less affected by stress than -SBV and barren housed pigs,
   respectively. Moreover, immune activation might be differently organized
   in individuals with different coping styles and to a lesser extent in
   individuals of opposite genders.}},

Abstract = {{Androstenone is one of the compounds causing boar taint of pork and is
   highly heritable (approximately 0.6). Recently, indirect genetic effects
   (IGE; also known as associative effects or social genetic effects) were
   found for androstenone, meaning that pen mates (boars) affect each
   other's androstenone level genetically. Similar to estimating variance
   components with a direct-indirect animal model, direct and indirect
   genetic SNP effects can be estimated for androstenone. This study aims
   to detect SNP with significant direct genetic effects and IGE on
   androstenone. The dataset consisted of 1,282 noncastrated boars (993
   boars genotyped) from 184 groups of pen members. After quality control,
   46,421 SNP were included in the analysis. One model for single-SNP
   regression was fitted, where both the direct SNP effect of the
   individual itself and the indirect SNP effects of its pen mates were
   included. None of the SNP (direct or indirect) were found genomewide
   significant. One QTL on SSC6 was chromosome-wide significant for the
   direct effect. A single SNP on SSC9 and 2 regions and a single SNP on
   SSC14 were found for the indirect effect. A backwards elimination method
   and haplotype analysis were used to quantify the variance explained by
   the SNP. The backwards elimination method identified 4 independent
   regions affecting androstenone. The QTL on SSC6 explained 2.1 and 2.6\%
   of the phenotypic variance using the backwards elimination method or the
   haplotype analysis. The QTL on SSC14 explained 3.4 and 2.7\% of the
   phenotypic variance using the backwards elimination method or the
   haplotype analysis. The single association on SSC9 explained 2.2\% of
   the phenotypic variance. All significant QTL together explained 7 to 8\%
   of phenotypic variance and 40 to 44\% of the total genetic variance
   available for response to selection. Besides the newly discovered QTL
   and the confirmation of known QTL, this study also presents a
   methodology to model SNP for IGE.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},

Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{3039-3046}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Populations evolve in response to the external environment, whether
   abiotic (e. g., climate) or biotic (e. g., other conspecifics). We
   investigated how adaptation to biotic, heritable environments differs
   from adaptation to abiotic, nonheritable environments. We found that,
   for the same selection coefficients, the coadaptive process between
   genes and heritable environments is much faster than genetic adaptation
   to an abiotic nonheritable environment. The increased rate of adaptation
   results from the positive association generated by reciprocal selection
   between the heritable environment and the genes responding to it. These
   associations result in a runaway process of adaptive coevolution, even
   when the genes creating the heritable environment and genes responding
   to the heritable environment are unlinked. Although tightening the
   degree of linkage accelerates the coadaptive process, the acceleration
   caused by a comparable amount of inbreeding is greater, because
   inbreeding has a cumulative effect on reducing functional recombination
   over generations. Our results suggest that that adaptation to local
   abiotic environmental variation may result in the rapid diversification
   of populations and subsequent reproductive isolation not directly but
   rather via its effects on heritable environments and the genes
   responding to them.}},

Volume = {{184}},

Abstract = {{Many species spend their lives in close association with other
   organisms, and the environments provided by those organisms can play an
   important role as causes of variation in phenotypes. When this is the
   case, the genotypes of the individuals constituting the environment may
   influence the phenotypes of individuals living in that environment. When
   these effects are between heterospecifics, interspecific indirect
   genetic effects (IIGEs) occur. Several studies have detected IIGEs, but
   whether IIGEs contribute to variation in sexually selected traits
   remains virtually unexplored. We assessed how mate preferences in a
   plant-feeding insect are influenced by the genotype of their host plant.
   We established clone lines of a sample of host plant genotypes
   constituting the background biotic environment for a random sample of
   insects that we reared on them. We found that the insects' mate
   preferences varied according to the clone line on which they developed.
   These results demonstrate that genetic variation in host plants has
   cross-trophic consequences on a trait that has strong effects on fitness
   and interpopulation dynamics such as diversification in communication
   systems. We discuss how IIGEs on mate preferences may influence the way
   in which selection acts, including the maintenance of variation and the
   promotion of evolutionary divergence.}},

Volume = {{113}},

Abstract = {{Infectious diseases have a major role in evolution by natural selection
   and pose a worldwide concern in livestock. Understanding quantitative
   genetics of infectious diseases, therefore, is essential both for
   understanding the consequences of natural selection and for designing
   artificial selection schemes in agriculture. The basic reproduction
   ratio, R-0, is the key parameter determining risk and severity of
   infectious diseases. Genetic improvement for control of infectious
   diseases in host populations should therefore aim at reducing R-0. This
   requires definitions of breeding value and heritable variation for R-0,
   and understanding of mechanisms determining response to selection. This
   is challenging, as R-0 is an emergent trait arising from interactions
   among individuals in the population. Here we show how to define breeding
   value and heritable variation for R-0 for genetically heterogeneous host
   populations. Furthermore, we identify mechanisms determining utilization
   of heritable variation for R-0. Using indirect genetic effects,
   next-generation matrices and a SIR (Susceptible, Infected and Recovered)
   model, we show that an individual's breeding value for R-0 is a function
   of its own allele frequencies for susceptibility and infectivity and of
   population average susceptibility and infectivity. When interacting
   individuals are unrelated, selection for individual disease status
   captures heritable variation in susceptibility only, yielding limited
   response in R-0. With related individuals, however, there is a secondary
   selection process, which also captures heritable variation in
   infectivity and additional variation in susceptibility, yielding
   substantially greater response. This shows that genetic variation in
   susceptibility represents an indirect genetic effect. As a consequence,
   response in R-0 increased substantially when interacting individuals
   were genetically related.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have seen increasing interest in indirect genetic effects,
   i.e. influences on the phenotype that depend on the genotype of other
   conspecific individuals; however, the empirical evidence for such
   effects is still limited, especially in wild plant species. The present
   study of the clonal herb Sedum album assessed direct and indirect
   genetic effects on performance-related traits in a 4-year experiment
   with clonally replicated genotypes, grown in pairs and differing in
   anthocyanin pigmentation to allow separation of individuals during data
   collection. In agreement with the existence of indirect genetic effects,
   the experimentally-paired plants not only expressed their own genotype
   but were also affected by the genotype of their pair mate. The effect of
   neighbour genotype explained up to one-fourth of the variation in
   performance and most likely resulted from competition, imposed by the
   close physical contact between paired individuals and the limiting
   conditions used in the garden environment. Indirect genetic effects from
   competition have the potential to enhance the efficacy of group-level
   selection relative to individual selection, given the nutrient-poor and
   spatially-confined substrate available to plants of S. album in the
   natural habitat.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{281}},

Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{With global temperatures projected to surpass the limits of thermal
   tolerance for many species, evaluating the heritable variation
   underlying thermal tolerance is critical for understanding the potential
   for adaptation to climate change. We examined the evolutionary potential
   of thermal tolerance within a population of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus
   tshawytscha) by conducting a full-factorial breeding design and
   measuring the thermal performance of cardiac function and the critical
   thermal maximum (CTmax) of offspring from each family. Additive genetic
   variation in offspring phenotypewas mostly negligible, although these
   direct genetic effects explained 53\% of the variation in resting heart
   rate (f(H)). Conversely, maternal effects had a significant influence on
   resting f(H), scope for f(H), cardiac arrhythmia temperature and CTmax.
   These maternal effects were associated with egg size, as indicated by
   strong relationships between the mean egg diameter of mothers and
   offspring thermal tolerance. Because egg size can be highly heritable in
   chinook salmon, our finding indicates that the maternal effects of egg
   size constitute an indirect genetic effect contributing to thermal
   tolerance. Such indirect genetic effects could accelerate evolutionary
   responses to the selection imposed by rising temperatures and could
   contribute to the population-specific thermal tolerance that has
   recently been uncovered among Pacific salmon populations.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{3139-3145}},

Abstract = {{Transgenerational effects are broader than only parental relationships.
   Despite mounting evidence that multigenerational effects alter
   phenotypic and life-history traits, our understanding of how they
   combine to determine fitness is not well developed because of the added
   complexity necessary to study them. Here, we derive a quantitative
   genetic model of adaptation to an extraordinary new environment by an
   additive genetic component, phenotypic plasticity, maternal and
   grandmaternal effects. We show how, at equilibrium, negative maternal
   and negative grandmaternal effects maximize expected population mean
   fitness. We define negative transgenerational effects as those that have
   a negative effect on trait expression in the subsequent generation, that
   is, they slow, or potentially reverse, the expected evolutionary
   dynamic. When maternal effects are positive, negative grandmaternal
   effects are preferred. As expected under Mendelian inheritance, the
   grandmaternal effects have a lower impact on fitness than the maternal
   effects, but this dual inheritance model predicts a more complex
   relationship between maternal and grandmaternal effects to constrain
   phenotypic variance and so maximize expected population mean fitness in
   the offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Ongoing evolution of polyandry, and consequent extra-pair reproduction
   in socially monogamous systems, is hypothesized to be facilitated by
   indirect selection stemming from cross-sex genetic covariances with
   components of male fitness. Specifically, polyandry is hypothesized to
   create positive genetic covariance with male paternity success due to
   inevitable assortative reproduction, driving ongoing coevolution.
   However, it remains unclear whether such covariances could or do emerge
   within complex polyandrous systems. First, we illustrate that genetic
   covariances between female extra-pair reproduction and male within-pair
   paternity success might be constrained in socially monogamous systems
   where female and male additive genetic effects can have opposing impacts
   on the paternity of jointly reared offspring. Second, we demonstrate
   nonzero additive genetic variance in female liability for extra-pair
   reproduction and male liability for within-pair paternity success,
   modeled as direct and associative genetic effects on offspring
   paternity, respectively, in free-living song sparrows (Melospiza
   melodia). The posterior mean additive genetic covariance between these
   liabilities was slightly positive, but the credible interval was wide
   and overlapped zero. Therefore, although substantial total additive
   genetic variance exists, the hypothesis that ongoing evolution of female
   extra-pair reproduction is facilitated by genetic covariance with male
   within-pair paternity success cannot yet be definitively supported or
   rejected either conceptually or empirically.}},

   male mating success in water striders}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We examined the relative importance of individual differences in
   personality (activity and aggressiveness), social skill and the social
   environment (average activity and aggressiveness of the group, presence
   of hyperaggressive males) in determining the behaviour and mating
   success of males of the stream water strider, Aquarius remigis. Males
   that had a consistently more active-aggressive behavioural type had, on
   average, higher mating success largely because they spent more time
   active in microhabitats associated with acquiring mates. Some
   active-aggressive males, however, showed hyperaggressive behaviour,
   apparently attempting to mate forcibly with other males, or forcibly
   separate pairs, which was rarely successful. A higher tendency to be
   hyperaggressive was associated with reduced mating success (i.e. being
   hyperaggressive represents low social skill). The overall effect was
   thus stabilizing sexual selection on male activity and aggression. The
   social environment also had large effects on male behaviour and mating
   success. In particular, the presence of a keystone hyperaggressive male
   had strong negative effects on the mating success and general activity
   of other males in the pool. Notably, males with a more active-aggressive
   behavioural type maintained higher mating success than less
   active-aggressive males in the presence of a hyperaggressive male.
   Social plasticity (change in behaviour in response to changing social
   conditions) also depended on the male's behavioural type; males with a
   more active-aggressive behavioural type were more plastic. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Many organisms live in populations structured by space and by class,
   exhibit plastic responses to their social partners, and are subject to
   nonadditive ecological and fitness effects. Social evolution theory has
   long recognized that all of these factors can lead to different
   selection pressures but has only recently attempted to synthesize how
   these factors interact. Using models for both discrete and continuous
   phenotypes, we show that analyzing these factors in a consistent
   framework reveals that they interact with one another in ways previously
   overlooked. Specifically, behavioral responses (reciprocity), genetic
   relatedness, and synergy interact in nontrivial ways that cannot be
   easily captured by simple summary indices of assortment. We demonstrate
   the importance of these interactions by showing how they have been
   neglected in previous synthetic models of social behavior both within
   and between species. These interactions also affect the level of
   behavioral responses that can evolve in the long run; proximate
   biological mechanisms are evolutionarily stable when they generate
   enough responsiveness relative to the level of responsiveness that
   exactly balances the ecological costs and benefits. Given the richness
   of social behavior across taxa, these interactions should be a boon for
   empirical research as they are likely crucial for describing the complex
   relationship linking ecology, demography, and social behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The epigenetic phenomenon of genomic imprinting has motivated the
   development of numerous theories for its evolutionary origins and
   genomic distribution. In this review, we examine the three theories that
   have best withstood theoretical and empirical scrutiny. These are: Haig
   and colleagues' kinship theory; Day and Bonduriansky's sexual antagonism
   theory; and Wolf and Hager's maternal-offspring coadaptation theory.
   These theories have fundamentally different perspectives on the adaptive
   significance of imprinting. The kinship theory views imprinting as a
   mechanism to change gene dosage, with imprinting evolving because of the
   differential effect that gene dosage has on the fitness of matrilineal
   and patrilineal relatives. The sexual antagonism and maternal-offspring
   coadaptation theories view genomic imprinting as a mechanism to modify
   the resemblance of an individual to its two parents, with imprinting
   evolving to increase the probability of expressing the fitter of the two
   alleles at a locus. In an effort to stimulate further empirical work on
   the topic, we carefully detail the logic and assumptions of all three
   theories, clarify the specific predictions of each and suggest tests to
   discriminate between these alternative theories for why particular genes
   are imprinted.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one
   individual alter the phenotype of an interacting partner. IGEs can
   dramatically affect the expression and evolution of social traits.
   However, the interacting phenotype(s) through which they are transmitted
   are often unknown, or cryptic, and their detection would enhance our
   ability to accurately predict evolutionary change. To illustrate this
   challenge and possible solutions to it, we assayed male leg-tapping
   behavior using inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster paired with a
   common focal male strain. The expression of tapping in focal males was
   dependent on the genotype of their interacting partner, but this strong
   IGE was cryptic. Using a multiple-regression approach, we identified
   male startle response as a candidate interacting phenotype: the longer
   it took interacting males to settle after being startled, the less focal
   males tapped them. A genome-wide association analysis identified
   approximately a dozen candidate protein-coding genes potentially
   underlying the IGE, of which the most significant was slowpoke. Our
   methodological framework provides information about candidate phenotypes
   and candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms that underpin a strong yet
   cryptic IGE. We discuss how this approach can facilitate the detection
   of cryptic IGEs contributing to unusual evolutionary dynamics in other
   study systems.}},

Abstract = {{According to classical parental care theory males are expected to
   provide less parental care when offspring in a brood are less likely to
   be their own, but empirical evidence in support of this relationship is
   equivocal. Recent work predicts that social interactions between the
   sexes can modify co-evolution between traits involved in mating and
   parental care as a result of costs associated with these social
   interactions (i.e. sexual conflict). In burying beetles (Nicrophorus
   vespilloides), we use artificial selection on a paternity assurance
   trait, and crosses within and between selection lines, to show that
   selection acting on females, not males, can drive the co-evolution of
   paternity assurance traits and parental care. Males do not care more in
   response to selection on mating rate. Instead, patterns of parental care
   change as an indirect response to costs of mating for females.}},

Title = {{Indirect genetic effects and inbreeding: consequences of BLUP selection
   for socially affected traits on rate of inbreeding}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: Social interactions often occur among living organisms,
   including aquatic animals. There is empirical evidence showing that
   social interactions may genetically affect phenotypes of individuals and
   their group mates. In this context, the heritable effect of an
   individual on the phenotype of another individual is known as an
   Indirect Genetic Effect (IGE). Selection for socially affected traits
   may increase response to artificial selection, but also affect rate of
   inbreeding.
   Methods: A simulation study was conducted to examine the effect of Best
   Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) selection for socially affected traits
   on the rate of inbreeding. A base scenario without IGE and three
   alternative scenarios with different magnitudes of IGE were simulated.
   In each generation, 25 sires and 50 dams were mated, producing eight
   progeny per dam. The population was selected for 20 generations using
   BLUP. Individuals were randomly assigned to groups of eight members in
   each generation, with two families per group, each contributing four
   individuals. ``Heritabilities{''} (for both direct and indirect genetic
   effects) were equal to 0.1, 0.3 or 0.5, and direct-indirect genetic
   correlations were -0.8, -0.4, 0, 0.4, or 0.8. The rate of inbreeding was
   calculated from generation 10 to 20.
   Results: For the base scenario, the rates of inbreeding were 4.09, 2.80
   and 1.95\% for ``heritabilities{''} of 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5, respectively.
   Overall, rates of inbreeding for the three scenarios with IGE ranged
   from 2.21 to 5.76\% and were greater than for the base scenarios. The
   results show that social interaction within groups of two families
   increases the resemblance between estimated breeding values of
   relatives, which, in turn, increases the rate of inbreeding.
   Conclusion: BLUP selection for socially affected traits increased the
   rate of inbreeding. To maintain inbreeding at an acceptable rate, a
   selection algorithm that restricts the increase in mean kinship, such as
   optimum contribution selection, is required.}},

Abstract = {{W. D. Hamilton famously suggested that the inflated relatedness of full
   sisters under haplodiploidy explains why all workers in the social
   hymenoptera are female. This suggestion has not stood up to further
   theoretical scrutiny and is not empirically supported. Rather, it
   appears that altruistic sib-rearing in the social hymenoptera is
   performed exclusively by females because this behaviour has its origins
   in parental care, which was performed exclusively by females in the
   ancestors of this insect group. However, haplodiploidy might still
   explain the sex of workers if this mode of inheritance has itself been
   responsible for the rarity of paternal care in this group. Here, we
   perform a theoretical kin selection analysis to investigate the
   evolution of paternal care in diploid and haplodiploid populations. We
   find that haplodiploidy may either inhibit or promote paternal care
   depending on model assumptions, but that under the most plausible
   scenarios it promotes - rather than inhibits - paternal care. Our
   analysis casts further doubt upon there being a causal link between
   haplodiploidy and eusociality.}},

Abstract = {{Many reproductive traits that have evolved under sexual conflict may be
   influenced by both sexes. Investigation of the genetic architecture of
   such traits can yield important insight into their evolution, but this
   entails that the heritable component of variation is estimated for males
   and femalesas an interacting phenotype. We address the lack of research
   in this area through an investigation of egg production and copula
   duration in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Despite egg
   production rate being determined by both sexes, which may cause sexual
   conflict, an assessment of this trait as an interacting phenotype is
   lacking. It is currently unclear whether copula duration is determined
   by males and/or females. We found significant female, but not male,
   genetic variance for egg production rate that may indicate reduced
   potential for ongoing sexually antagonistic coevolution. In contrast,
   copula duration was determined by significant genetic variance in both
   sexes. We also identified genetic variation in egg retention among
   virgin females. Although previously identified in wild populations, it
   is unclear why this should be present in a laboratory stock. This study
   provides a novel insight into the shared genetic architecture of
   reproductive traits that are the subject of sexual conflict.}},

Abstract = {{Phenotypes are often environmentally dependent, which requires organisms
   to track environmental change. The challenge for organisms is to
   construct phenotypes using the most accurate environmental cue.
   Here, we use a quantitative genetic model of adaptation by additive
   genetic variance, within- and transgenerational plasticity via linear
   reaction norms and indirect genetic effects respectively.
   We show how the relative influence on the eventual phenotype of these
   components depends on the predictability of environmental change (fast
   or slow, sinusoidal or stochastic) and the developmental lag tau between
   when the environment is perceived and when selection acts.
   We then decompose expected mean fitness into three components (variance
   load, adaptation and fluctuation load) to study the fitness costs of
   within- and transgenerational plasticity. A strongly negative maternal
   effect coefficient m minimizes the variance load, but a strongly
   positive m minimises the fluctuation load. The adaptation term is
   maximized closer to zero, with positive or negative m preferred under
   different environmental scenarios.
   Phenotypic plasticity is higher when tau is shorter and when the
   environment changes frequently between seasonal extremes. Expected mean
   population fitness is highest away from highest observed levels of
   phenotypic plasticity.
   Within- and transgenerational plasticity act in concert to deliver
   well-adapted phenotypes, which emphasizes the need to study both
   simultaneously when investigating phenotypic evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Production traits such as growth rate may depend on the social
   interactions between group members. These social interactions may be
   partly heritable and are referred to as indirect genetic effects (IGE)
   or social, associative, or competitive genetic effects. Indirect genetic
   effects may contribute to heritable variation in traits and can
   therefore be used to increase the response to selection. This, however,
   has hardly been tested by selection experiments. Our objective was to
   determine the effects of 1 generation of selection on IGE for growth
   (IGEg) in pigs on ADG, BW, ADFI, feed efficiency, and postmortem
   measurements. Sires (n = 24) and dams (n = 64) were selected to create a
   high vs. low contrast for IGEg in the offspring (n = 480). The IGE
   difference was 2.8 g ADG per pen mate, corresponding to 14 g higher ADG
   in high IGEg offspring compared to low IGEg offspring when housed in
   groups of 6 (i.e., (6 - 1) x 2.8 = 14). Male (barrows) and female
   (gilts) offspring were housed in groups of 6 of the same IGEg
   classification, in either barren concrete pens or pens enriched with
   straw and wood shavings (n = 80 pens). Pigs were followed from birth to
   slaughter. Data were analyzed in a mixed model with pen as random
   factor. There was no difference in ADG between high and low IGEg pigs
   during the finishing period (wk 10 to 23). Opposite to expectations,
   high IGEg tended to have a 17 g lower ADG from weaning to slaughter (P =
   0.08), which was caused by a higher BW of low IGEg pigs in wk 5 (P =
   0.008). This led to a 2.3 kg lower carcass weight (P = 0.02) and 2.2 mm
   less muscle depth for high IGEg pigs (P = 0.03). High IGEg pigs had a
   higher stomach wall damage score (P = 0.01). Pigs on straw had a 25 g
   lower ADG during finishing (P = 0.03) and less stomach wall damage (P <
   0.001). Fewer interventions against harmful behavior were required in
   high IGEg pigs. The unexpected results regarding IGEg may be due to
   several reasons. Despite initial power calculations showing good power,
   the IGEg contrast between groups may have been too small. Moreover,
   measures that were taken to limit harmful behavior may have had a
   substantial role. Harmful behavior such as tail biting may affect ADG
   and might underlie the effects of selection on IGEg in pigs. Research
   under commercial circumstances, where harmful behavior is likely to be
   more profound, may give more accurate insight into the benefits of
   selecting for IGEg.}},

Title = {{Plumage condition in laying hens: genetic parameters for direct and
   indirect effects in two purebred layer lines}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Feather pecking is a major welfare issue in laying hen
   industry that leads to mortality. Due to a ban on conventional cages in
   the EU and on beak trimming in some countries of the EU, feather pecking
   will become an even bigger problem. Its severity depends both on the
   victim receiving pecking and on its group mates inflicting pecking
   (indirect effects), which together determine plumage condition of the
   victim. Plumage condition may depend, therefore, on both the direct
   genetic effect of an individual itself and on the indirect genetic
   effects of its group mates. Here, we present estimated genetic
   parameters for direct and indirect effects on plumage condition of
   different body regions in two purebred layer lines, and estimates of
   genetic correlations between body regions.
   Methods: Feather condition scores (FCS) were recorded at 40 weeks of age
   for neck, back, rump and belly and these four scores were added-up into
   a total FCS. A classical animal model and a direct-indirect effects
   model were used to estimate genetic parameters for FCS. In addition, a
   bivariate model with mortality (0/ 1) was used to account for mortality
   before recording FCS. Due to mortality during the first 23 weeks of
   laying, 5363 (for W1) and 5089 (for WB) FCS records were available.
   Results: Total heritable variance for FCS ranged from 1.5\% to 9.8\% and
   from 9.8\% to 53.6\% when estimated respectively with the classical
   animal and the direct-indirect effects model. The direct-indirect
   effects model had a significantly higher likelihood. In both lines, 70\%
   to 94\% of the estimated total heritable variation in FCS was due to
   indirect effects. Using bivariate analysis of FCS and mortality did not
   affect estimates of genetic parameters. Genetic correlations were high
   between adjacent regions for FCS on neck, back, and rump but moderate to
   low for belly with other regions.
   Conclusion: Our results show that 70\% to 94\% of the heritable
   variation in FCS relates to indirect effects, indicating that methods of
   genetic selection that include indirect genetic effects offer
   perspectives to improve plumage condition in laying hens. This, in turn
   could reduce a major welfare problem.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple organisms can sometimes affect a common phenotype. For example,
   the portion of a leaf eaten by an insect is a joint phenotype of the
   plant and insect and the amount of food obtained by an offspring can be
   a joint trait with its mother. Here, I describe the evolution of joint
   phenotypes in quantitative genetic terms. A joint phenotype for multiple
   species evolves as the sum of additive genetic variances in each
   species, weighted by the selection on each species. Selective conflict
   between the interactants occurs when selection takes opposite signs on
   the joint phenotype. The mean fitness of a population changes not just
   through its own genetic variance but also through the genetic variance
   for its fitness that resides in other species, an update of Fisher's
   fundamental theorem of natural selection. Some similar results, using
   inclusive fitness, apply to within-species interactions. The models
   provide a framework for understanding evolutionary conflicts at all

Abstract = {{Hamilton's theory of inclusive fitness revolutionized our understanding
   of the evolution of social interactions. Surprisingly, an incorporation
   of Hamilton's perspective into the quantitative genetic theory of
   phenotypic evolution has been slow, despite the popularity of
   quantitative genetics in evolutionary studies. Here, we discuss several
   versions of Hamilton's rule for social evolution from a quantitative
   genetic perspective, emphasizing its utility in empirical applications.
   Although evolutionary quantitative genetics offers methods to measure
   each of the critical parameters of Hamilton's rule, empirical work has
   lagged behind theory. In particular, we lack studies of selection on
   altruistic traits in the wild. Fitness costs and benefits of altruism
   can be estimated using a simple extension of phenotypic selection
   analysis that incorporates the traits of social interactants. We also
   discuss the importance of considering the genetic influence of the
   social environment, or indirect genetic effects (IGEs), in the context
   of Hamilton's rule. Research in social evolution has generated an
   extensive body of empirical work focusing-with good reason-almost solely
   on relatedness. We argue that quantifying the roles of social and
   non-social components of selection and IGEs, in addition to relatedness,
   is now timely and should provide unique additional insights into social
   evolution.}},

Title = {{Indirect genetic effects contribute substantially to heritable variation
   in aggression-related traits in group-housed mink (Neovison vison)}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Since the recommendations on group housing of mink (Neovison
   vison) were adopted by the Council of Europe in 1999, it has become
   common in mink production in Europe. Group housing is advantageous from
   a production perspective, but can lead to aggression between animals and
   thus raises a welfare issue. Bite marks on the animals are an indicator
   of this aggressive behaviour and thus selection against frequency of
   bite marks should reduce aggression and improve animal welfare. Bite
   marks on one individual reflect the aggression of its group members,
   which means that the number of bite marks carried by one individual
   depends on the behaviour of other individuals and that it may have a
   genetic basis. Thus, for a successful breeding strategy it could be
   crucial to consider both direct (DGE) and indirect (IGE) genetic effects
   on this trait. However, to date no study has investigated the genetic
   basis of bite marks in mink.
   Result and discussion: A model that included DGE and IGE fitted the data
   significantly better than a model with DGE only, and IGE contributed a
   substantial proportion of the heritable variation available for response
   to selection. In the model with IGE, the total heritable variation
   expressed as the proportion of phenotypic variance (T-2) was six times
   greater than classical heritability (h(2)). For instance, for total bite
   marks, T-2 was equal to 0.61, while h(2) was equal to 0.10. The genetic
   correlation between direct and indirect effects ranged from 0.55 for
   neck bite marks to 0.99 for tail bite marks. This positive correlation
   suggests that mink have a tendency to fight in a reciprocal way (giving
   and receiving bites) and thus, a genotype that confers a tendency to
   bite other individuals can also cause its bearer to receive more bites.
   Conclusion: Both direct and indirect genetic effects contribute to
   variation in number of bite marks in group-housed mink. Thus, a genetic
   selection design that includes both direct genetic and indirect genetic
   effects could reduce the frequency of bite marks and probably aggression
   behaviour in group-housed mink.}},

Title = {{Hemiclonal analysis of interacting phenotypes in male and female
   Drosophila melanogaster}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAY 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Identifying the sources of variation in mating interactions
   between males and females is important because this variation influences
   the strength and/or the direction of sexual selection that populations
   experience. While the origins and effects of variation in male
   attractiveness and ornamentation have received much scrutiny, the causes
   and consequences of intraspecific variation in females have been
   relatively overlooked. We used cytogenetic cloning techniques developed
   for Drosophila melanogaster to create ``hemiclonal{''} males and females
   with whom we directly observed sexual interaction between individuals of
   different known genetic backgrounds and measured subsequent reproductive
   outcomes. Using this approach, we were able to quantify the genetic
   contribution of each mate to the observed phenotypic variation in
   biologically important traits including mating speed, copulation
   duration, and subsequent offspring production, as well as measure the
   magnitude and direction of intersexual genetic correlation between
   female choosiness and male attractiveness.
   Results: We found significant additive genetic variation contributing to
   mating speed that can be attributed to male genetic identity, female
   genetic identity, but not their interaction. Furthermore we found that
   phenotypic variation in copulation duration had a significant
   male-associated genetic component. Female genetic identity and the
   interaction between male and female genetic identity accounted for a
   substantial amount of the observed phenotypic variation in egg size.
   Although previous research predicts a trade-off between egg size and
   fecundity, this was not evident in our results. We found a strong
   negative genetic correlation between female choosiness and male
   attractiveness, a result that suggests a potentially important role for
   sexually antagonistic alleles in sexual selection processes in our
   population.
   Conclusion: These results further our understanding of sexual selection
   because they identify that genetic identity plays a significant role in
   phenotypic variation in female behaviour and fecundity. This variation
   may be potentially due to ongoing sexual conflict found between the
   sexes for interacting phenotypes. Our unexpected observation of a
   negative correlation between female choosiness and male attractiveness
   highlights the need for more explicit theoretical models of genetic
   covariance to investigate the coevolution of female choosiness and male
   attractiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects are powerful forces of adaptive evolution but their
   widespread implications, especially in human-disturbed environments, are
   still being realized. Here we examine the role of maternal effects in
   shaping fitness-related behaviour and life-history traits in black widow
   spiders, Latrodectus hesperus. We test the prediction that adult
   foraging success shapes maternal body condition, fecundity and egg
   investment, and that maternal prey abundance has a positive,
   cross-generational effect on a number of important offspring traits. Our
   results suggest that maternal foraging success is indeed translated into
   positive effects on maternal body condition, eggsac mass, egg number,
   egg mass, egg size, egg density and development rate. Maternal feeding
   had no effect on sibling cannibalism. Interestingly, despite the
   statistically significant effects of maternal food regime on offspring
   parameters listed above, some mothers in the high-food treatment
   nevertheless made low-density eggs and some mothers in the low-food
   treatment made high-density eggs. Thus, maternal egg investment, and
   several other life-history variables, were influenced by a family effect
   that cannot be explained solely by our manipulation of maternal
   foraging. For example, a strong effect of family on the latency to
   sibling cannibalism, in the absence of any link between maternal food
   regime, egg density and cannibalism, suggests that direct genetic
   effects, rather than maternal effects, may explain this fitness-related
   behavioural trait. We discuss the implications of these findings for our
   understanding of the behaviour, ecology and evolution of this and other
   arthropods, with particular reference to the possibility that maternal
   effects may facilitate rapid evolution to human-disturbed habitats. (C)

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},

Volume = {{68}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Niche construction refers to the activities of organisms that bring
   about changes in their environments, many of which are evolutionarily
   and ecologically consequential. Advocates of niche construction theory
   (NCT) believe that standard evolutionary theory fails to recognize the
   full importance of niche construction, and consequently propose a novel
   view of evolution, in which niche construction and its legacy over time
   (ecological inheritance) are described as evolutionary processes,
   equivalent in importance to natural selection. Here, we subject NCT to
   critical evaluation, in the form of a collaboration between one
   prominent advocate of NCT, and a team of skeptics. We discuss whether
   niche construction is an evolutionary process, whether NCT obscures or
   clarifies how natural selection leads to organismal adaptation, and
   whether niche construction and natural selection are of equivalent
   explanatory importance. We also consider whether the literature that
   promotes NCT overstates the significance of niche construction, whether
   it is internally coherent, and whether it accurately portrays standard
   evolutionary theory. Our disagreements reflect a wider dispute within
   evolutionary theory over whether the neo-Darwinian synthesis is in need
   of reformulation, as well as different usages of some key terms (e.g.,
   evolutionary process).}},

Title = {{The Evolution of Multivariate Maternal Effects}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in predicting the social and ecological
   contexts that favor the evolution of maternal effects. Most predictions
   focus, however, on maternal effects that affect only a single character,
   whereas the evolution of maternal effects is poorly understood in the
   presence of suites of interacting traits. To overcome this, we simulate
   the evolution of multivariate maternal effects (captured by the matrix
   M) in a fluctuating environment. We find that the rate of environmental
   fluctuations has a substantial effect on the properties of M: in slowly
   changing environments, offspring are selected to have a multivariate
   phenotype roughly similar to the maternal phenotype, so that M is
   characterized by positive dominant eigenvalues; by contrast, rapidly
   changing environments favor Ms with dominant eigenvalues that are
   negative, as offspring favor a phenotype which substantially differs
   from the maternal phenotype. Moreover, when fluctuating selection on one
   maternal character is temporally delayed relative to selection on other
   traits, we find a striking pattern of cross-trait maternal effects in
   which maternal characters influence not only the same character in
   offspring, but also other offspring characters. Additionally, when
   selection on one character contains more stochastic noise relative to
   selection on other traits, large cross-trait maternal effects evolve
   from those maternal traits that experience the smallest amounts of
   noise. The presence of these cross-trait maternal effects shows that
   individual maternal effects cannot be studied in isolation, and that
   their study in a multivariate context may provide important insights
   about the nature of past selection. Our results call for more studies
   that measure multivariate maternal effects in wild populations.}},

Title = {{Modelling of feather pecking behavior in beak-trimmed and

   trait-based approach}},
Journal = {{POULTRY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{773-783}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Because of a ban on the use of beak trimming in some European countries,
   feather pecking is becoming a substantial problem in the layer industry,
   both from animal welfare and economic points of view. The feather
   condition score (FCS) as a measure of feather damage has been shown to
   be closely related to feather pecking behavior in laying hens housed in
   groups. To obtain a better understanding of genetic and other biological
   mechanisms underlying feather pecking behavior, data on FCS of a
   population of 2,724 female offspring from crossing 50 male W1 and 907
   female WB purebred lines were used. The offspring of 25 sires were
   beak-trimmed, and the offspring of another 25 sires were
   non-beak-trimmed. Titers of plasma natural antibody (NAb) isotypes IgM
   and IgG binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin at 24 wk of age were measured.
   Feather condition was scored at 53 wk of age. In the first part of the
   present study, we estimated genetic parameters for FCS with 2 variance
   components models: a traditional linear animal model and a model
   combining direct and associative genetic effects. In the second part of
   the present study, a trait-based analysis for FCS was conducted to
   investigate whether NAb isotype titers can explain variation in FCS
   among individuals, by fitting a linear mixed model. Though the estimated
   associative genetic variance was substantial, associative effects for
   FCS were not statistically significant in both populations (P = 0.09 in
   beak-trimmed birds, and P = 0.08 in non-beak-trimmed birds). This
   suggests an insufficient number of records on FCS. Individual's NAb
   isotypes titers did not show direct effect for FCS of itself, but
   individual's IgG titers showed a suggestive effect on the FCS of cage
   mates (associative effect) in beak-trimmed laying hens, which need
   further confirmation.}},

Title = {{The Influence of Social Environment: Behavior of Unrelated Adults
   Affects Future Juvenile Behaviors}},
Journal = {{ETHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{388-399}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Juveniles' behaviors are often influenced by the behaviors of
   conspecifics. Most experimental studies of the influence of conspecific
   behavior vary the social environment by the presence or absence of
   conspecifics or investigate the impact of the outcome of social
   encounters (winner/loser effects) but less frequently expose individuals
   to variation in behavioral phenotypes present in the social environment.
   Based on previous work showing that juveniles of the salamander
   Plethodon cinereus are likely to interact frequently with non-parental
   adults, I hypothesized that territorial adults in the social environment
   alter the future behaviors of juveniles. I measured the intracohort
   social behaviors of juvenile salamanders collected from two geographic
   areas, Michigan (MI) and Virginia (VA), before and after housing with
   ostensibly territorial (VA) or non-territorial (MI) adults. There were
   overall effects of adult territoriality and aggression on the behavior
   of juveniles. However, juveniles from populations in MI were especially
   susceptible to behavioral modification. Compared with behaviors prior to
   being housed with adults, MI juveniles increased investigatory and
   escape behaviors in juvenile-juvenile interactions after being housed
   with adults that displayed territorial behaviors and decreased
   investigatory and escape behaviors after being housed with
   non-territorial adults. This study shows that not only is a specific
   behavior, territoriality of adult salamanders, a social environment that
   modifies future juvenile behaviors, but the effects of social
   environment may differ between populations.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Social selection and indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are established
   concepts in both behavioural ecology and evolutionary genetics. While
   IGEs describe effects of an individual's genotype on phenotypes of
   social partners (and may thus affect their fitness indirectly), the
   concept of social selection assumes that a given phenotype in one
   individual affects the fitness of other individuals directly. Although
   different frameworks, both have been used to investigate the evolution
   of social traits, such as cooperative behaviour. Despite their
   similarities (both concepts consider interactions among individuals),
   they differ in the type of interaction. It remains unclear whether the
   two concepts make the same predictions about evolutionary trajectories
   or not. To address this question, we investigate four possible scenarios
   of social interactions and compare the effects of IGEs and social
   selection for trait evolution in a multi-trait multi-member model. We
   show that the two mechanisms can yield similar evolutionary outcomes and
   that both can create selection pressure at the group level. However, the
   effect of IGEs can be stronger due to the possibility of feedback loops.
   Finally, we demonstrate that IGEs, but not social selection gradients,
   may lead to differences in the direction of evolutionary response
   between genotypes and phenotypes.}},

   field studies and are often binary. However, current methods to analyse
   binary disease data fail to take infection dynamics into account.
   Moreover, genetic analyses tend to focus on host susceptibility,
   ignoring potential variation in infectiousness, i.e. the ability of a
   host to transmit the infection. This stands in contrast to
   epidemiological studies, which reveal that variation in infectiousness
   plays an important role in the progression and severity of epidemics. In
   this study, we aim at filling this gap by deriving an expression for the
   probability of becoming infected that incorporates infection dynamics
   and is an explicit function of both host susceptibility and
   infectiousness. We then validate this expression according to
   epidemiological theory and by simulating epidemiological scenarios, and
   explore implications of integrating this expression into genetic
   analyses.
   Results: Our simulations show that the derived expression is valid for a
   range of stochastic genetic-epidemiological scenarios. In the particular
   case of variation in susceptibility only, the expression can be
   incorporated into conventional quantitative genetic analyses using a
   complementary log-log link function (rather than probit or logit).
   Similarly, if there is moderate variation in both susceptibility and
   infectiousness, it is possible to use a logarithmic link function,
   combined with an indirect genetic effects model. However, in the
   presence of highly infectious individuals, i.e. super-spreaders, the use
   of any model that is linear in susceptibility and infectiousness causes
   biased estimates. Thus, in order to identify super-spreaders, novel
   analytical methods using our derived expression are required.
   Conclusions: We have derived a genetic-epidemiological function for
   quantitative genetic analyses of binary infectious disease data, which,
   unlike current approaches, takes infection dynamics into account and
   allows for variation in host susceptibility and infectiousness.}},

   a clonal ant}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In social species, the phenotype and fitness of an individual depend in
   part on the genotype of its social partners. However, how these indirect
   genetic effects affect genotype fitness in competitive situations is
   poorly understood in animal societies. We therefore studied phenotypic
   plasticity and fitness of two clones of the ant Cerapachys biroi in
   monoclonal and chimeric colonies. Here we show that, while clone B has
   lower fitness in isolation, surprisingly, it consistently outcompetes
   clone A in chimeras. The reason is that, in chimeras, clone B produces
   more individuals specializing in reproduction rather than cooperative
   tasks, behaving like a facultative social parasite. A cross-fostering
   experiment shows that the proportion of these individuals depends on
   intergenomic epistasis between larvae and nursing adults, explaining the
   flexible allocation strategy of clone B. Our results suggest that
   intergenomic epistasis can be the proximate mechanism for social
   parasitism in ants, revealing striking analogies between social insects
   and social microbes.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are widespread, both in natural
   and domestic populations. As a result, trait values of individuals may
   be affected by genes in other individuals, a phenomenon known as
   indirect genetic effects (IGEs). IGEs can be estimated using linear
   mixed models. The traditional IGE model assumes that an individual
   interacts equally with all its partners, whether kin or strangers. There
   is abundant evidence, however, that individuals behave differently
   towards kin as compared with strangers, which agrees with predictions
   from kin-selection theory. With a mix of kin and strangers, therefore,
   IGEs estimated from a traditional model may be incorrect, and selection
   based on those estimates will be suboptimal. Here we investigate whether
   genetic parameters for IGEs are statistically identifiable in
   group-structured populations when IGEs differ between kin and strangers,
   and develop models to estimate such parameters. First, we extend the
   definition of total breeding value and total heritable variance to cases
   where IGEs depend on relatedness. Next, we show that the full set of
   genetic parameters is not identifiable when IGEs differ between kin and
   strangers. Subsequently, we present a reduced model that yields
   estimates of the total heritable effects on kin, on non-kin and on all
   social partners of an individual, as well as the total heritable
   variance for response to selection. Finally we discuss the consequences
   of analysing data in which IGEs depend on relatedness using a
   traditional IGE model, and investigate group structures that may allow
   estimation of the full set of genetic parameters when IGEs depend on
   kin.}},

Abstract = {{In many species, males have the capacity to directly influence (either

   examine how an individual male's identity may be related to phenotypic
   variation in short-term female fecundity in the model species,
   Drosophila melanogaster. The effect of male identity on short-term
   fecundity stimulation of females was repeatable across time and
   accounted for over a fifth of the total observed phenotypic variation in

Abstract = {{1Predicting the response of communities and ecosystems to range shifts
   as a consequence of global climate change is a critical challenge
   confronting modern evolutionary ecologists. Indirect genetic effects
   (IGEs) occur when the expression of genes in a conspecific neighbouring
   species affects the phenotype of a focal species, and the same concept
   applies for interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGEs) except that
   the neighbouring species is then required to be heterospecific. Theory
   and empirical data indicate that indirect genetic effects and
   interspecific indirect genetic effects have fundamental roles in
   understanding the consequences of genotypic diversity, evolutionary
   feedbacks, the co-evolutionary process and coadaptation and are a
   primary mechanism for the broad ecological and evolutionary dynamics
   that are likely to be a consequence of climate change. When indirect
   genetic effects and interspecific indirect genetic effects occur along
   environmental gradients, both positive and negative feedbacks can
   evolve, resulting in regions of strong local adaptation and competition
   as well as regions of complementarity and facilitation. Such
   evolutionary dynamics have direct consequences for how individuals
   interact and evolve in mixture and drive the services ecosystems
   provide. Integrating indirect genetic effects and interspecific indirect
   genetic effects, feedbacks and diversity effects along environmental
   gradients represents a major conceptual, theoretical and empirical
   frontier that must be considered to understand the whole-system
   consequences of climate change on biodiversity and the services
   ecosystems provide.}},

Abstract = {{Community genetics research has demonstrated bottom-up' effects of
   genetic variation within a plant species in shaping the larger community

   complex of treehoppers (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to ask whether male
   mating signals are influenced by host plant genetic variation. We reared
   a random sample of the treehoppers on potted replicates of a sample of

   according to the clone line on which they developed, showing that
   genetic variation in host plants affects male treehoppers' behavioural

Title = {{Direct and social genetic parameters for growth and fin damage traits in
   Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua)}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: The aim of the study was to estimate genetic parameters for
   direct and social genetic effects (SGE) for growth and welfare traits in
   farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). A SGE refers to the effect of an
   individual's genes on trait performance of its social partners. In
   total, 2100 individually tagged juveniles from 100 families at an
   average age of 222 days post-hatching were used. Each family was
   separated into three groups of seven fish, and were randomly assigned to
   100 experimental tanks, together with fish from two other families. Body
   weight and length of the first, second and third dorsal fin and the
   caudal fin measured by digital image analysis were measured at the start
   of the experiment, after two weeks, and after six weeks. Fin erosion was
   scored subjectively after six weeks. Variance components estimated using
   a conventional animal model were compared to those of an animal model
   including a SGE.
   Results: Heritabilities from the conventional animal model ranged from
   0.24 to 0.34 for body weight and 0.05 to 0.80 for fin length.
   Heritabilities for fin erosion were highest for the first dorsal fin
   (0.83 +/- 0.08, mean +/- standard error) and lowest for the third dorsal
   fin (0.01 +/- 0.04). No significant SGE were found for body weight,
   whereas SGE for fin lengths were significant after two and six weeks.
   Contributions to the total heritable variance were equal to 21.5\% (6.1
   +/- 2.1) for the direct effect, 33.1\% (9.4 +/- 3.2) for the
   direct-social covariance, and 45.4\% (12.9 +/- 4.1) for the social
   variance for length of the first dorsal fin. For fin erosion, SGE were
   only significant for the second and third dorsal fin.
   Conclusions: Including SGE for fin length and fin erosion in the animal
   model increased the estimated heritable variation. However, estimates of
   total heritable variances were inaccurate and a larger experiment is
   needed to accurately quantify total heritable variance. Despite this,
   our results demonstrate that considering social breeding values for fin
   length or fin erosion when selecting fish will enable us to improve
   response to selection for welfare traits in Atlantic cod juveniles.}},

Abstract = {{Social influences on mate choice are predicted to influence evolutionary
   divergence of closely related taxa, because of the key role mate choice
   plays in reproductive isolation. However, it is unclear whether females
   choosing between heterospecific and conspecific male signals use
   previously experienced social information in the same manner or to the
   same extent that they do when discriminating among conspecific mates
   only. We tested this using two field cricket sister species
   (Teleogryllus oceanicus and Teleogryllus commodus), in which
   considerable information is known about the role of male calling song in
   premating isolation, in addition to the influence of acoustic experience
   on the development of reproductive traits. We manipulated the acoustic
   experience of replicate populations of both species and found,
   unexpectedly, that experience of male calling song during rearing did
   not change how accurate females were in choosing a conspecific over a
   heterospecific male song during playback trials. However, females with
   acoustic experience were considerably less responsive to male song
   compared with naive females. Our results suggest that variation in the
   acoustic environment affects mate choice in both species, but that it
   may have a limited impact on premating isolation. The fact that social
   flexibility during interspecific mate discrimination does not appear to
   operate identically to that which occurs during conspecific mate
   discrimination highlights the importance of considering the context in
   which animals exercise socially flexible mating behaviours. We suggest
   an explanation for why social flexibility might be context dependent and
   discuss the consequences of such flexibility for the evolution of
   reproductive isolation.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGE) occur when the genotype of an individual
   affects the phenotypic trait value of another conspecific individual.
   IGEs can have profound effects on both the magnitude and the direction
   of response to selection. Models of inheritance and response to
   selection in traits subject to IGEs have been developed within two
   frameworks; a trait-based framework in which IGEs are specified as a
   direct consequence of individual trait values, and a variance-component
   framework in which phenotypic variance is decomposed into a direct and
   an indirect additive genetic component. This work is a selective review
   of the quantitative genetics of traits affected by IGEs, with a focus on
   modelling, estimation and interpretation issues. It includes a
   discussion on variance-component vs trait-based models of IGEs, a review
   of issues related to the estimation of IGEs from field data, including
   the estimation of the interaction coefficient W (psi), and a discussion
   on the relevance of IGEs for response to selection in cases where the
   strength of interaction varies among pairs of individuals. An
   investigation of the trait-based model shows that the interaction
   coefficient W may deviate considerably from the corresponding regression
   coefficient when feedback occurs. The increasing research effort devoted
   to IGEs suggests that they are a widespread phenomenon, probably
   particularly in natural populations and plants. Further work in this
   field should considerably broaden our understanding of the quantitative
   genetics of inheritance and response to selection in relation to the
   social organisation of populations.}},

Title = {{Competition as a source of constraint on life history evolution in

Volume = {{112}},

Pages = {{70-78}},

Abstract = {{Competition among individuals is central to our understanding of ecology
   and population dynamics. However, it could also have major implications
   for the evolution of resource-dependent life history traits (for
   example, growth, fecundity) that are important determinants of fitness
   in natural populations. This is because when competition occurs, the
   phenotype of each individual will be causally influenced by the
   phenotypes, and so the genotypes, of competitors. Theory tells us that
   indirect genetic effects arising from competitive interactions will give
   rise to the phenomenon of `evolutionary environmental deterioration',
   and act as a source of evolutionary constraint on resource-dependent
   traits under natural selection. However, just how important this
   constraint is remains an unanswered question. This article seeks to
   stimulate empirical research in this area, first highlighting some
   patterns emerging from life history studies that are consistent with a
   competition-based model of evolutionary constraint, before describing
   several quantitative modelling strategies that could be usefully
   applied. A recurrent theme is that rigorous quantification of a
   competition's impact on life history evolution will require an
   understanding of the causal pathways and behavioural processes by which
   genetic (co) variance structures arise. Knowledge of the G-matrix among
   life history traits is not, in and of itself, sufficient to identify the
   constraints caused by competition.}},

Abstract = {{Social dynamics, the emergent effects of interactions within structured
   groups, play a key role in shaping social phenotypes and fitness. We
   examined the potential positive and negative effects of social dynamics
   in simple groups, by creating social groups of harvester ant queens with
   2 alternate nest-founding strategies, solitary versus cooperative. We
   compared social interactions, survival, and nest productivity of pairs
   containing queens from the cooperative founding population, the normally
   solitary founding population, or mixed pairs of the 2 types. Expressed
   social phenotypes of queens in pairs depended strongly on the lineage of
   the other queen. Two behaviors, aggression and brood care, showed simple
   social dynamical effects. Aggression escalated in pairs of normally
   solitary queens, whereas queens in cooperative pairs coordinated brood
   output, leading to more efficient worker production. These dynamics had
   context-based fitness consequences, such that cooperative queens gained
   a survival advantage in cooperative pairs, but neither type of queen
   experienced an advantage or disadvantage in ``mixed{''} associations.
   The interplay between social dynamics and fitness in these associations
   provides an empirical example of social selection. It captures a likely
   scenario of the transition to and the early evolution of cooperative
   living, in which cooperative individuals interact with solitary
   individuals who lack a priori strategies for cooperation or cheating.}},

Abstract = {{Disentangling the relative roles of males, females and their interactive
   effects on competitive fertilization success remains a challenge in
   sperm competition. In this study, we apply a novel experimental
   framework to an ideally suited externally fertilizing model system in
   order to delineate these roles. We focus on the chinook salmon,
   Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, a species in which ovarian fluid (OF) has been
   implicated as a potential arbiter of cryptic female choice for
   genetically compatible mates. We evaluated this predicted sexually
   selected function of OF using a series of factorial competitive
   fertilization trials. Our design involved a series of 10 factorial
   crosses, each involving two `focal' rival males whose sperm competed
   against those from a single `standardized' (non-focal) rival for a
   genetically uniform set of eggs in the presence of OF from two focal
   females. This design enabled us to attribute variation in competitive
   fertilization success among focal males, females (OF) and their
   interacting effects, while controlling for variation attributable to
   differences in the sperm competitive ability of rival males, and
   male-by-female genotypic interactions. Using this experimental
   framework, we found that variation in sperm competitiveness could be
   attributed exclusively to differences in the sperm competitive ability
   of focal males, a conclusion supported by subsequent analyses revealing
   that variation in sperm swimming velocity predicts paternity success.
   Together, these findings provide evidence that variation in paternity
   success can be attributed to intrinsic differences in the sperm
   competitive ability of rival males, and reveal that sperm swimming
   velocity is a key target of sexual selection.}},

Volume = {{280}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) describe how an individual's
   behaviour-which is influenced by his or her genotype-can affect the
   behaviours of interacting individuals. IGE research has focused on
   dyads. However, insights from social networks research, and other
   studies of group behaviour, suggest that dyadic interactions are
   affected by the behaviour of other individuals in the group. To extend
   IGE inferences to groups of three or more, IGEs must be considered from
   a group perspective. Here, I introduce the `focal interaction' approach
   to study IGEs in groups. I illustrate the utility of this approach by
   studying aggression among natural genotypes of Drosophila melanogaster.
   I chose two natural genotypes as `focal interactants': the behavioural
   interaction between them was the `focal interaction'. One male from each
   focal interactant genotype was present in every group, and I varied the
   genotype of the third male-the `treatment male'. Genetic variation in
   the treatment male's aggressive behaviour influenced the focal
   interaction, demonstrating that IGEs in groups are not a straightforward
   extension of IGEs measured in dyads. Further, the focal interaction
   influenced male mating success, illustrating the role of IGEs in
   behavioural evolution. These results represent the first manipulative
   evidence for IGEs at the group level.}},

   at higher levels has gained considerable theoretical support in recent
   years, and one possible level of selection is the breeding pair where

   individuals. We analyzed the importance of pair-level selection over
   25years in a natural population of the collared flycatcher. Pair-level
   selection was significant in five and probably in another 9years. The
   relative importance of pair-level selection varied over years and can
   have stronger or the same strength as directional selection. This means
   that selection can act on the combination of the breeding pair in
   addition to selection on each individual separately. Overall, the

Abstract = {{Animals can influence their social environment by preferentially
   associating with certain conspecifics. Such preferential association has
   gained increasing theoretical attention, as it may influence social
   evolution and population dynamics. However, relatively little empirical
   work has examined the occurrence of preferential association and its
   effects on cooperative group formation. Here, we test the factors
   associated with cooperative group formation in Polistes dominulus
   nest-founding queen wasps. P.dominulus are a good system to study
   preferential association, as foundresses can nest alone or in groups and
   group membership is flexible. We found that both social and
   environmental factors were associated with partner choice. First, facial
   patterns were associated with cooperation. Wasps with more similar
   facial patterns were more likely to cooperate than wasps with less
   similar facial patterns. This preferential phenotypic association fits
   the theoretical criteria for the evolution of tag-based cooperation.
   Season was also associated with cooperation; wasps on early-season nests
   were more likely to cooperate than wasps on late-season nests. High
   levels of aggression by nest owners during initial interactions were
   also correlated with lower probabilities of subsequent cooperation,
   suggesting that nest owners have some control over group membership.
   Other factors including body weight, weight similarity and nest
   productivity were not linked with cooperation. Overall, multiple factors
   influence cooperation in paper wasps, including facial pattern

Abstract = {{Many social behaviors are triggered by social partners. For example,
   cells in a multicellular organism often become soma via extrinsically
   regulated differentiation, while individuals in a eusocial colony often
   become helpers via extrinsic caste determination. One explanation for
   social triggering is that it informs when it is beneficial to express
   the behavior. Alternatively, social triggering can represent
   manipulation where social partners partially or completely control the
   focal individual''s behavior. For instance, caste determination in
   primitively eusocial taxa is typically accomplished via differential
   feeding or dominance hierarchies, suggesting some manipulation. However,
   selection would favor resistance if manipulation is detrimental to
   manipulated parties, and the outcome of the manipulation conflict
   remains intricate. We analyze the coevolution of manipulation and
   resistance in a simple but general setting. We show that, despite
   possible resistance, manipulated behavior can be established under less
   stringent conditions than spontaneous (i.e., nonmanipulated) behavior
   because of resistance costs. The existence of this advantage might
   explain why primitive eusocial behavior tends to be triggered socially
   and coercively. We provide a simple condition for the advantage of
   manipulated behavior that may help infer whether a socially triggered
   behavior is manipulated. We illustrate our analysis with a hypothetical
   example of maternal manipulation relevant to primitive eusociality.}},

Abstract = {{Pigs housed together in a group influence each other's growth. Part of
   this effect is genetic and can be represented in a social breeding
   value. It is unknown, however, which traits are associated with social
   breeding values. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate
   whether personality and response to novelty could be associated with
   social breeding values for growth in piglets. Female and castrated male
   piglets from 80 litters, with either an estimated relative positive or
   negative social breeding value (+SBV or -SBV) for growth, were
   individually tested in a backtest and novel environment test, and
   group-wise in a novel object (i.e., a feeder with feed) test and human
   approach test. All tests were performed during the suckling period. No
   differences between +SBV and -SBV piglets were found for the frequency
   and latency of struggling and vocalizing in the backtest (at least, P >
   0.30). In the novel object test, piglets with a +SBV for growth touched
   the feeder faster than piglets with -SBV for growth (P = 0.01) and were
   more frequently present near the person in the human approach test (P <
   0.01). No behavioral differences between +SBV and -SBV pig-lets were
   found in the novel environment test (at least, P > 0.40), but piglets
   that struggled more in the backtest walked more in this test (P = 0.02).
   Behavior was affected by gender in each test. Female piglets were faster
   than castrated male piglets to start struggling in the backtest (P =
   0.047). In the novel object test, females were faster than males to
   touch the feeder and sample the feed. In the human approach test, they
   were also faster than male piglets to touch a person (all, P < 0.001).
   Females were also more frequently present near the feeder (P < 0.001)
   and person (P = 0.03). In the novel environment test, female piglets
   explored the floor more (P = 0.046), produced less low-(P = 0.04) and
   high-pitched vocalizations (P = 0.02), and defecated (P = 0.08) and
   urinated less than male piglets (P < 0.01). It was concluded that +SBV
   and -SBV piglets do not differ in their response to the backtest, and
   only subtle differences were found in their response to novelty. More
   research is warranted to identify the traits underlying SBV for growth
   in pigs. Moreover, castrated male piglets seemed to react more fearfully
   to each test than female piglets.}},

Title = {{Using pooled data to estimate variance components and breeding values
   for traits affected by social interactions}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{45}},
Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Through social interactions, individuals affect one
   another's phenotype. In such cases, an individual's phenotype is
   affected by the direct (genetic) effect of the individual itself and the
   indirect (genetic) effects of the group mates. Using data on individual
   phenotypes, direct and indirect genetic (co)variances can be estimated.
   Together, they compose the total genetic variance that determines a
   population's potential to respond to selection. However, it can be
   difficult or expensive to obtain individual phenotypes. Phenotypes on
   traits such as egg production and feed intake are, therefore, often
   collected on group level. In this study, we investigated whether direct,
   indirect and total genetic variances, and breeding values can be
   estimated from pooled data (pooled by group). In addition, we determined
   the optimal group composition, i.e. the optimal number of families
   represented in a group to minimise the standard error of the estimates.
   Methods: This study was performed in three steps. First, all research
   questions were answered by theoretical derivations. Second, a simulation
   study was conducted to investigate the estimation of variance components
   and optimal group composition. Third, individual and pooled survival
   records on 12 944 purebred laying hens were analysed to investigate the
   estimation of breeding values and response to selection.
   Results: Through theoretical derivations and simulations, we showed that
   the total genetic variance can be estimated from pooled data, but the
   underlying direct and indirect genetic (co)variances cannot. Moreover,
   we showed that the most accurate estimates are obtained when group
   members belong to the same family. Additional theoretical derivations
   and data analyses on survival records showed that the total genetic
   variance and breeding values can be estimated from pooled data.
   Moreover, the correlation between the estimated total breeding values
   obtained from individual and pooled data was surprisingly close to one.
   This indicates that, for survival in purebred laying hens, loss in
   response to selection will be small when using pooled instead of
   individual data.
   Conclusions: Using pooled data, the total genetic variance and breeding
   values can be estimated, but the underlying genetic components cannot.
   The most accurate estimates are obtained when group members belong to
   the same family.}},

Journal = {{PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{280}},
Number = {{1763}},
Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Patterns of phenotypic variation arise in part from plasticity owing to
   social interactions, and these patterns contribute, in turn, to the form
   of selection that shapes the variation we observe in natural
   populations. This proximate-ultimate dynamic brings genetic variation in
   social environments to the forefront of evolutionary theory. However,
   the extent of this variation remains largely unknown. Here, we use a
   member of the Enchenopa binotata species complex of treehoppers
   (Hemiptera: Membracidae) to assess how mate preferences are influenced
   by genetic variation in the social environment. We used full-sibling
   split-families as `treatment' social environments, and reared focal
   females alongside each treatment family, describing the mate preferences
   of the focal females. With this method, we detected substantial genetic
   variation in social influence on mate preferences. The mate preferences
   of focal females varied according to the treatment families along with
   which they grew up. We discuss the evolutionary implications of the
   presence of such genetic variation in social influence on mate
   preferences, including potential contributions to the maintenance of
   genetic variation, the promotion of divergence, and the adaptive
   evolution of social effects on fitness-related traits.}},

Journal = {{GENETICS}},

Volume = {{194}},

Abstract = {{Structural equation models (SEMs) are multivariate specifications
   capable of conveying causal relationships among traits. Although these
   models offer insights into how phenotypic traits relate to each other,
   it is unclear whether and how they can improve multiple-trait selection.
   Here, we explored concepts involved in SEMs, seeking for benefits that
   could be brought to breeding programs, relative to the standard
   multitrait model (MTM) commonly used. Genetic effects pertaining to SEMs
   and MTMs have distinct meanings. In SEMs, they represent genetic effects
   acting directly on each trait, without mediation by other traits in the
   model; in MTMs they express overall genetic effects on each trait,
   equivalent to lumping together direct and indirect genetic effects
   discriminated by SEMs. However, in breeding programs the goal is
   selecting candidates that produce offspring with best phenotypes,
   regardless of how traits are causally associated, so overall additive
   genetic effects are the matter. Thus, no information is lost in standard
   settings by using MTM-based predictions, even if traits are indeed
   causally associated. Nonetheless, causal information allows predicting
   effects of external interventions. One may be interested in predictions
   for scenarios where interventions are performed, e. g., artificially
   defining the value of a trait, blocking causal associations, or
   modifying their magnitudes. We demonstrate that with information
   provided by SEMs, predictions for these scenarios are possible from data
   recorded under no interventions. Contrariwise, MTMs do not provide
   information for such predictions. As livestock and crop production
   involves interventions such as management practices, SEMs may be
   advantageous in many settings.}},

Title = {{Parasitoid wasps influence where aphids die via an interspecific
   indirect genetic effect}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Host-parasite interactions are a key paradigm for understanding the
   process of coevolution. Central to coevolution is how genetic variation
   in interacting species allows parasites to evolve manipulative
   strategies. However, genetic variation in the parasite may also be
   associated with host phenotype changes, thereby changing the selection
   on both species. For instance, parasites often induce changes in the
   behaviour of their host to maximize their own fitness, yet the
   quantitative genetic basis for behavioural manipulation has not been
   fully demonstrated. Here, we show that the genotype of the parasitoid
   wasp Aphidius ervi has a significant effect on where its aphid host
   Acyrthosiphon pisum moves to die following parasitism, including the
   likelihood that the aphid abandons the plant. These results provide a

Abstract = {{Organisms that face behavioural challenges can use different types of
   information to guide their decisions. First, they can use the personal
   information they sample in their environment. Second, they can use the
   inadvertent social information provided by the behaviour of conspecifics
   or heterospecifics (i.e. public information). Currently, little is known
   about the interaction between genetic variation and the use of personal
   versus public information in natural populations. Here, we investigated
   whether a natural genetic polymorphism affects the use of personal
   versus public information in a spatial learning task in Drosophila
   melanogaster. We found that genetic variation at the foraging locus
   interacts with social context during spatial learning. While both
   allelic variants are able to use personal and public information to
   improve their navigation during 10 training trials, a probe trial
   revealed that individuals carrying the for(R) (rover) allele rely mainly
   on personal information, whereas individuals carrying the for(s)
   (sitter) allele either use or display more public information than
   rovers. Accordingly, transfer of social information is more important in
   groups of sitters than in groups of rovers. These results suggest that a
   positive feedback loop can occur between alleles promoting group living,
   such as for(s), and the use and/or display of public information,
   ultimately providing the opportunity for the joint evolution of
   sociality and cultural traits.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Indirect Genetic Effects (IGEs), also known as associative effects, are
   the heritable effects that an individual has on the phenotype of its
   social partners. Selection for IGEs has been proposed as a method to
   reduce harmful behaviours, in particular aggression, in livestock and
   aquaculture. The mechanisms behind IGEs, however, have rarely been
   studied. The objective was therefore to assess aggression in pigs which
   were divergently selected for IGEs on growth (IGEg). In a one generation
   selection experiment, we studied 480 offspring of pigs (Sus scrofa) that
   were selected for relatively high or low IGEg and housed in homogeneous
   IGEg groups in either barren or enriched environments. Skin lesion
   scores, a proxy measure of aggression, and aggressive behaviours were
   recorded. The two distinct IGEg groups did not differ in number of skin
   lesions, or in amount of reciprocal fighting, both under stable social
   conditions and in confrontation with unfamiliar pigs in a 24 h
   regrouping test. Pigs selected for a positive effect on the growth of
   their group members, however, performed less non-reciprocal biting and
   showed considerably less aggression at reunion with familiar group
   members after they had been separated during a 24 h regrouping test. The
   enriched environment was associated with more skin lesions but less
   non-reciprocal biting under stable social conditions. Changes in
   aggression between pigs selected for IGEg were not influenced by GxE
   interactions with regard to the level of environmental enrichment. It is
   likely that selection on IGEg targets a behavioural strategy, rather
   than a single behavioural trait such as aggressiveness.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific genetic variation can affect decomposition, nutrient
   cycling, and interactions between plants and their associated
   belowground communities. However, the effects of genetic variation on
   ecosystems can also be indirect, meaning that genes in a focal plant may
   affect ecosystems by altering the phenotype of interacting (i.e.,
   neighboring) individuals. We manipulated genotype identity, species
   identity, and the possibility of belowground interactions between
   neighboring Solidago plants. We hypothesized that, because our plants
   were nitrogen (N) limited, the most important interactions between focal
   and neighbor plants would occur belowground. More specifically, we
   hypothesized that the genotypic identity of a plant's neighbor would
   have a larger effect on belowground biomass than on aboveground biomass,
   but only when neighboring plants were allowed to interact belowground.
   We detected species- and genotype-level variation for aboveground
   biomass and ramet production. We also found that belowground biomass and
   ramet production depended on the interaction of neighbor genotype
   identity and the presence or absence of belowground interactions.
   Additionally, we found that interspecific indirect genetic effects
   (IIGEs; changes in focal plant traits due to the genotype identity of a
   heterospecific neighbor) had a greater effect size on belowground
   biomass than did focal genotype; however, this effect only held in pots
   that allowed belowground interactions. These results expand the types of
   natural processes that can be attributed to genotypes by showing that,
   under certain conditions, a plant's phenotype can be strongly determined
   by the expression of genes in its neighbor. By showing that IIGEs are
   dependent upon plants being able to interact belowground, our results
   also provide a first step for thinking about how genotype-based,
   belowground interactions influence the evolutionary outcomes of
   plant-neighbor interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Kin selection theory is a kind of causal analysis. The initial form of
   kin selection ascribed cause to costs, benefits and genetic relatedness.
   The theory then slowly developed a deeper and more sophisticated
   approach to partitioning the causes of social evolution. Controversy
   followed because causal analysis inevitably attracts opposing views. It
   is always possible to separate total effects into different component
   causes. Alternative causal schemes emphasize different aspects of a
   problem, reflecting the distinct goals, interests and biases of
   different perspectives. For example, group selection is a particular
   causal scheme with certain advantages and significant limitations.
   Ultimately, to use kin selection theory to analyse natural patterns and
   to understand the history of debates over different approaches, one must
   follow the underlying history of causal analysis. This article describes
   the history of kin selection theory, with emphasis on how the causal
   perspective improved through the study of key patterns of natural
   history, such as dispersal and sex ratio, and through a unified approach
   to demographic and social processes. Independent historical developments
   in the multivariate analysis of quantitative traits merged with the
   causal analysis of social evolution by kin selection.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic variance-covariance (G) matrix describes the variances and
   covariances of genetic traits under strict genetic inheritance.
   Genetically expressed traits often influence trait expression in another
   via nongenetic forms of transmission and inheritance, however. The
   importance of non-genetic influences on phenotypic evolution is
   increasingly clear, but how genetic and nongenetic inheritance interact
   to determine the response to selection is not well understood. Here, we
   use the reachability matrix' - a key analytical tool of geometric
   control theory - to integrate both forms of inheritance, capturing how
   the consequences of generation-lagged maternal effects accumulate.
   Building on the classic Lande and Kirkpatrick model that showed how
   nongenetic (maternal) inheritance fundamentally alters the expected path
   of phenotypic evolution, we make novel inferences through decomposition
   of the reachability matrix. In particular, we quantify how nongenetic
   inheritance affects the distribution (orientation and shape) of ellipses
   of phenotypic change and how these distributions influence subsequent
   evolution. This interweaving of phenotypic means and variances
   accumulates generation by generation and is described analytically by
   the reachability matrix, which acts as an analogue of G when genetic and
   nongenetic inheritance both act.}},

Abstract = {{Mate choice often depends on the properties of both sexes, such as the
   preference and responsiveness of the female and the sexual display
   traits of the male. Quantitative genetic studies, however, traditionally
   explore the outcome of an interaction between males and females based
   solely on the genotype of one sex, treating the other sex as a source of
   environmental variance. Here, we use a half-sib breeding design in the
   field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus, to estimate the additive genetic
   contribution of both partners to three steps of the mate choice process:
   the time taken to mate; the duration of spermatophore attachment; and
   the intensity of mate guarding. Rather than each sex contributing
   equally to the interactions, we found that genetic variation for latency
   to mate and spermatophore attachment was sex-specific, and in the case
   of mate-guarding intensity, largely absent. For a given interaction,
   genetic variation in one sex also appears to be largely independent of
   the other, and is also uncorrelated with the other traits. We discuss
   how pre- and postcopulatory interactions have the potential to evolve as
   an interacting phenotype, but that any coevolution between these traits,
   due to sexual selection or sexual conflict, may be limited.}},

Abstract = {{Several personality traits are mainly expressed in a social context, and
   others, which are not restricted to a social context, can be affected by
   the social interactions with conspecifics. In this paper, we focus on
   the recently proposed hypothesis that social niche specialization (i.e.
   individuals in a population occupy different social roles) can explain
   the maintenance of individual differences in personality. We first
   present ecological and social niche specialization hypotheses. In
   particular, we show how niche specialization can be quantified and
   highlight the link between personality differences and social niche
   specialization. We then review some ecological factors (e. g.
   competition and environmental heterogeneity) and the social mechanisms
   (e. g. frequency-dependent, state-dependent and social awareness) that
   may be associated with the evolution of social niche specialization and
   personality differences. Finally, we present a conceptual model and
   methods to quantify the contribution of ecological factors and social
   mechanisms to the dynamics between personality and social roles. In
   doing so, we suggest a series of research objectives to help empirical
   advances in this research area. Throughout this paper, we highlight
   empirical studies of social niche specialization in mammals, where

Abstract = {{A complete understanding of male reproductive success, and thus sexual
   selection, often requires an insight into male success in sperm
   competition. Genuine conclusions on male sperm competitiveness can only
   be made in real competitive situations. However, statistical analyses of
   sperm competitiveness from fertilization success data have been shown to
   be problematic. Here, I first outline a comprehensive general
   description of the different additive and nonadditive elements relevant
   for the outcome of sperm competition staged between two males. Based on
   this description, I will highlight two main problems that are frequently
   encountered in experiments aiming at estimating sperm competitiveness.
   First, I focus on potential problems when using standardized competitors
   versus random mating trials, because trials with standardized
   competitors do not allow generalization if malemale interactions are
   important. Second, I illustrate the necessity to analyze data on the
   logit scale rather than on raw proportions, because only the logit scale
   allows a clean separation of additive and nonadditive effects (i.e.,
   male x male and female x male interactions).}},

Abstract = {{Behavioral type-environment correlations occur when specific behavioral
   types of individuals are more common in certain environments. Behavioral
   type-environment correlations can be generated by several different
   mechanisms that are probably very common such as niche construction and
   phenotypic plasticity. Moreover, behavioral type-environment
   correlations have important ecological and evolutionary implications.
   However, few studies have examined behavioral type-environment
   correlations in natural populations. In this study, we asked whether
   some behavioral types of three-spined stickleback were more likely to
   occur in certain social environments (alone or in a shoal with other
   stickleback) or in certain microhabitats in a river (in the open or
   under cover). We found that individuals that were in shoals with other
   stickleback at the time of collection from the field emerged from a
   refuge more quickly compared to individuals that were found alone. In
   addition, fish that were alone in an open microhabitat explored more of
   a pool compared to fish that were alone in cover, but this difference
   did not occur among fish that were in shoals at the time of collection.
   Subsequent analyses of gut contents suggested that differences in
   microhabitat use were consistent over time. Our study provides some of
   the first evidence for behavioral type-environment correlations in a
   natural population of non-human animals.}},

Abstract = {{In many animals, experience modifies behaviour in a variety of ways and
   contexts. Here we focus on experience of social environments and
   phenotypic plasticity in mate preferences. We first review adaptive
   hypotheses about the evolution of social plasticity in mate preferences,
   finding support for all of them across different species. We suggest
   that future work should assess which patterns of variation in social
   environments select for which forms of plasticity in mate preferences.
   We then highlight that social plasticity in mate preferences creates
   feedback loops between the role of social environments as causes of
   variation in phenotypes and the role of social environments as causes of
   selection on phenotypes. Fully understanding the consequences of these
   feedbacks will involve assessing both how selection shapes the plastic
   response to variation in social environments and how individuals in
   social environments are selected to influence the mate preferences of
   others. This task is just beginning, but we review evidence of genetic
   variation in both of these aspects of social plasticity in mate
   preferences. (c) 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Abstract = {{Offspring size is often an intimate link between the fitness of parents
   and offspring. Among mammals, neonate mass is also related to adult
   levels of dimorphism and intrasexual competitive mating. We describe the
   sex-specific genetic architecture of neonate mass in captive squirrel
   monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis), a small Neotropical primate. Best fitting
   quantitative genetic models show strong maternal genetic effects with
   little difference between sexes offering limited opportunity for
   neonatal dimorphism to respond to observed or hypothetical selection.
   Heritabilities that are approximately zero also imply it is unlikely
   that neonatal dimorphism can evolve as a correlated response to
   selection on adult size. However, male mass is also more dependent on
   maternal condition (age and parity) making dimorphism plastic. Finally,
   we hypothesize that large maternal genetic effects reflect income
   breeding and tightly synchronized seasonal reproduction in squirrel
   monkeys, both of which require strong maternal control of offspring
   growth and timing of birth.}},

Abstract = {{Models for the evolution of cannibalism highlight the importance of
   asymmetries between individuals in initiating cannibalistic attacks.
   Studies may include measures of body size but typically group
   individuals into size/age classes or compare populations. Such broad
   comparisons may obscure the details of interactions that ultimately
   determine how socially contingent characteristics evolve. We propose
   that understanding cannibalism is facilitated by using an interacting
   phenotypes perspective that includes the influences of the phenotype of
   a social partner on the behaviour of a focal individual and focuses on
   variation in individual pairwise interactions. We investigated how
   relative body size, a composite trait between a focal individual and its
   social partner, and the sex of the partners influenced precannibalistic
   aggression in the endangered Socorro isopod, Thermosphaeroma
   thermophilum. We also investigated whether differences in mating
   interest among males and females influenced cannibalism in mixed sex
   pairs. We studied these questions in three populations that differ
   markedly in range of body size and opportunities for interactions among
   individuals. We found that relative body size influences the probability
   of and latency to attack. We observed differences in the likelihood of
   and latency to attack based on both an individual's sex and the sex of
   its partner but found no evidence of sexual conflict. The instigation of
   precannibalistic aggression in these isopods is therefore a property of
   both an individual and its social partner. Our results suggest that
   interacting phenotype models would be improved by incorporating a new
   conditional , which describes the strength of a social partner's
   influence on focal behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Cigarette smoking is the major environmental risk factor for chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Genome-wide association studies
   have provided compelling associations for three loci with COPD. In this
   study, we aimed to estimate direct, i.e., independent from smoking, and
   indirect effects of those loci on COPD development using mediation
   analysis. We included a total of 3,424 COPD cases and 1,872 unaffected
   controls with data on two smoking-related phenotypes: lifetime average
   smoking intensity and cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke (pack years).
   Our analysis revealed that effects of two linked variants (rs1051730 and
   rs8034191) in the AGPHD1/CHRNA3 cluster on COPD development are
   significantly, yet not entirely, mediated by the smoking-related
   phenotypes. Approximately 30 \% of the total effect of variants in the
   AGPHD1/CHRNA3 cluster on COPD development was mediated by pack years.
   Simultaneous analysis of modestly (r (2) = 0.21) linked markers in
   CHRNA3 and IREB2 revealed that an even larger ( 42 \%) proportion of the
   total effect of the CHRNA3 locus on COPD was mediated by pack years
   after adjustment for an IREB2 single nucleotide polymorphism. This study
   confirms the existence of direct effects of the AGPHD1/CHRNA3, IREB2,
   FAM13A and HHIP loci on COPD development. While the association of the
   AGPHD1/CHRNA3 locus with COPD is significantly mediated by
   smoking-related phenotypes, IREB2 appears to affect COPD independently
   of smoking.}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection can drive rapid evolutionary change in reproductive
   behaviour, morphology and physiology. This often leads to the evolution
   of sexual dimorphism, and continued exaggerated expression of dimorphic
   sexual characteristics, although a variety of other alternative
   selection scenarios exist. Here, we examined the evolutionary
   significance of a rapidly evolving, sexually dimorphic trait, sex comb
   tooth number, in two Drosophila species. The presence of the sex comb in
   both D.melanogaster and D.pseudoobscura is known to be positively
   related to mating success, although little is yet known about the
   sexually selected benefits of sex comb structure. In this study, we used
   experimental evolution to test the idea that enhancing or eliminating
   sexual selection would lead to variation in sex comb tooth number.
   However, the results showed no effect of either enforced monogamy or
   elevated promiscuity on this trait. We discuss several hypotheses to
   explain the lack of divergence, focussing on sexually antagonistic
   coevolution, stabilizing selection via species recognition and nonlinear
   selection. We discuss how these are important, but relatively ignored,
   alternatives in understanding the evolution of rapidly evolving sexually
   dimorphic traits.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Skew models predict how reproduction or resources produced by the group
   are divided between dominant and subordinate group members. These
   include transactional models, in which one group member may allocate
   some group productivity to another to prevent group dissolution and
   tug-of-war inefficiency models, in which group members compete for
   access to resources at a cost to group productivity. Although skew
   models involve a transactional or competitive interaction among group
   members, most existing models do not allow individuals to respond to new
   information about the strategy of their group mate. Here, I expand
   transactional and tug-of-war models to allow one individual (the
   follower) to respond plastically to a fixed strategy of its partner (the
   leader). I solve for the Stackelberg equilibrium conditions for each
   model. For the transactional model, leadership results in a greater
   share of group productivity to the leader compared with models that do
   not include leadership. When the follower's information about the
   leader's strategy is perfect, the equilibrium division of productivity
   does not vary with relatedness, in contrast to the predictions of
   previous skew models, and the effects of ecological variables may
   change. In the tug-of-war model, leadership influences equilibrium
   investment in competition only if relatedness is greater than zero.
   Dominant leaders receive a larger share of group productivity, but group
   productivity declines and grouping is mutually beneficial over a smaller
   parameter range than in the absence of leadership. Subordinate leaders
   receive a smaller share of group productivity, but benefit from overall
   higher group productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Conspecifics of many animal species physically compete to gain
   reproductive resources and thus fitness. Despite the importance of
   competitive ability across the animal kingdom, specific traits that
   influence or underpin competitive ability are poorly characterized.
   Here, we investigate whether there are genetic influences on competitive
   ability within male house mice. Additionally, we examined if litter
   demographics (litter size and litter sex ratio) influence competitive
   ability. We phenotyped two generations for a male's ability to possess a
   reproductive resource--a prime nesting site--using semi-natural
   enclosures with mixed sex groupings. We used the ``Animal Model{''}
   coupled with an extensive pedigree to estimate several genetic
   parameters. Competitive ability was found to be highly heritable, but
   only displayed a moderate genetic correlation to body mass.
   Interestingly, litter sex ratio had a weak negative influence on
   competitive ability. Litter size had no significant influence on
   competitive ability. Our study also highlights how much remains unknown
   about the proximal causes of competitive ability.}},

Abstract = {{Behavioural traits that are consistent over time and in different
   contexts are often referred to as personality traits. These traits
   influence fitness because they play a major role in foraging,
   reproduction and survival, and so it is assumed that they have little or
   no additive genetic variance and, consequently, low heritability
   because, theoretically, they are under strong selection. Boldness and
   aggressiveness are two personality traits that have been shown to affect
   fitness. By crossing single males to multiple females, we estimated the
   heritability of boldness and aggressiveness in the zebrafish, Danio
   rerio. The additive genetic variance was statistically significant for
   both traits and the heritability estimates (95 \% confidence intervals)
   for boldness and aggressiveness were 0.76 (0.49, 0.90) and 0.36 (0.10,
   0.72) respectively. Furthermore, there were significant maternal effects
   accounting for 18 and 9 \% of the proportion of phenotypic variance in
   boldness and aggressiveness respectively. This study shows that there is
   a significant level of genetic variation in this population that would
   allow these traits to evolve in response to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Both the environments experienced by a mother as a juvenile and an adult
   can affect her investment in offspring. However, the implications of
   these maternal legacies, both juvenile and adult, for offspring fitness
   in natural populations are unclear. We investigated whether the juvenile
   growth rate and adult reproductive traits (length, body condition, and
   reproductive investment at spawning) of female wild Atlantic salmon
   (Salmo salar) were related to the growth and survival of their
   offspring. Adult salmon captured on their upstream migration were used
   to create experimental full-sib clutches of eggs, which were mixed and
   then placed in artificial nests in a natural stream that lacked salmon
   due to a migration barrier. Four months later we resampled the stream to
   obtain family-level estimates of offspring size and survival. Mothers
   that had grown slowly as juveniles (as determined by scalimetry) but had
   invested heavily in reproduction (egg production for a given body
   length) and were in relatively poor body condition (somatic mass for a
   given body length) at spawning produced the largest eggs. Larger eggs
   resulted in larger juveniles and higher juvenile survival. However,
   after controlling for egg size, offspring growth was positively related
   to maternal juvenile growth rate and reproductive investment. The
   predictors of offspring survival (i.e., reproductive success) varied
   with the juvenile growth rate of the mother: If females grew slowly as
   juveniles, their reproductive success was negatively related to their
   own body condition. In contrast, the reproductive success of females
   that grew quickly as juveniles was instead related positively to their
   own body condition. Our results show that maternal influences on
   offspring in the wild can be complex, with reproductive success related
   to the early life performance of the mother, as well as her state at the
   time of breeding.}},

Abstract = {{Available experimental evidence suggests that there are genetic
   differences in the abilities of trees to compete for resources, in
   addition to non-genetic differences due to micro-site variation. The use
   of indirect genetic effects within the framework of linear mixed model
   methodology has been proposed for estimating genetic parameters and
   responses to selection in the presence of genetic competition. In this
   context, an individual's total breeding value reflects the effects of
   its direct breeding value on its own phenotype and its competitive
   breeding value on the phenotype of its neighbours. The present study
   used simulated data to investigate the relevance of accounting for
   competitive effects at the genetic and non-genetic levels in terms of
   the estimation of (co)variance components and selection response.
   Different experimental designs that resulted in different genetic
   relatedness levels within a neighbourhood and survival were other key
   issues examined. Variances estimated for additive genetic and residual
   effects tended to be biased under models that ignored genetic
   competition. Models that fitted competition at the genetic level only
   also resulted in biased (co)variance estimates for direct additive,
   competitive additive and residual effects. The ability to detect the
   correct model was reduced when relatedness within a neighbourhood was
   very low and survival decreased. Selection responses changed
   considerably between selecting on breeding value estimates from a model
   ignoring genetic competition and total breeding estimates using the
   correct model. Our results suggest that considering a genetic basis to
   competitive ability will be important to optimise selection programmes
   for genetic improvement of tree species.}},

Title = {{The Afterlife of Interspecific Indirect Genetic Effects: Genotype
   Interactions Alter Litter Quality with Consequences for Decomposition
   and Nutrient Dynamics}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Aboveground-belowground linkages are recognized as divers of community
   dynamics and ecosystem processes, but the impacts of plant-neighbor
   interactions on these linkages are virtually unknown. Plant-neighbor
   interactions are a type of interspecific indirect genetic effect (IIGE)
   if the focal plant's phenotype is altered by the expression of genes in
   a neighboring heterospecific plant, and IIGEs could persist after plant
   senescence to affect ecosystem processes. This perspective can provide
   insight into how plant-neighbor interactions affect evolution, as IIGEs
   are capable of altering species interactions and community composition
   over time. Utilizing genotypes of Solidago altissima and Solidago
   gigantea, we experimentally tested whether IIGEs that had affected
   living focal plants would affect litter decomposition rate, as well as
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) dynamics after the focal plant
   senesced. We found that species interactions affected N release and
   genotype interactions affected P immobilization. From a previous study
   we knew that neighbor genotype influenced patterns of biomass allocation
   for focal plants. Here we extend those previous results to show that
   these changes in biomass allocation altered litter quality, that then
   altered rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling. Our results provide
   insights into above- and belowground linkages by showing that, through
   their effects on plant litter quality (e.g., litter lignin: N), IIGEs
   can have afterlife effects, tying plant-neighbor interactions to
   ecosystem processes. This holistic approach advances our understanding
   of decomposition and nutrient cycling by showing that evolutionary
   processes (i.e., IIGEs) can influence ecosystem functioning after plant
   senescence. Because plant traits are determined by the combined effects
   of genetic and environmental influences, and because these traits are
   known to affect decomposition and nutrient cycling, we suggest that
   ecosystem processes can be described as gene-less products of genetic
   interactions among the species comprising ecological communities.}},

Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{569-578}},
Abstract = {{The role of female sex pheromones in natural selection, particularly as
   a means for species recognition to avoid the generation of hybrid
   offspring with low fitness, has been widely explored and is generally
   accepted by scholars. However, the significance of sex pheromones in
   shaping mate choice (sexual selection) and in competition over breeding
   resources (social selection) has been largely ignored. The effect of
   sexual selection on sex pheromones as a sexually dimorphic signaling
   trait has been discounted because the amount of pheromone released by
   females is typically minute, while the role of sex pheromones in
   competition over breeding resources (other than mates) has not yet been
   considered. As a result of natural selection, variation in sex
   pheromones among females is expected to be low, and males are not
   expected to choose their mates among pheromone-releasing conspecific
   females. Sexual selection, on the other hand, should drive the increase
   in pheromone variance among females, and males are expected to choose
   females based on this variation. Moreover, social selection resulting
   from more general social interactions, for example competition among
   females for breeding sites and food, should also promote variance among
   female sex pheromones. Here, we review the current evidence for each of
   the three selection processes acting on sex pheromones of female moths
   as an advertising trait. We suggest that the three selection types are
   not mutually exclusive but rather act together to promote different
   fitness components in diverse ecological situations.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) are heritable effects of individuals on
   trait values of their conspecifics. IGEs may substantially affect
   response to selection, but empirical studies on IGEs are sparse and
   their magnitude and correlation with direct genetic effects are largely
   unknown in plants.
   Here we used linear mixed models to estimate genetic (co) variances
   attributable to direct and indirect effects for growth and foliar
   disease damage in a large pedigreed population of Eucalyptus globulus.
   We found significant IGEs for growth and disease damage, which increased
   with age for growth. The correlation between direct and indirect genetic
   effects was highly negative for growth, but highly positive for disease
   damage, consistent with neighbour competition and infection,
   respectively. IGEs increased heritable variation by 71\% for disease
   damage, but reduced heritable variation by 85\% for growth, leaving
   nonsignificant heritable variation for later age growth. Thus, IGEs are
   likely to prevent response to selection in growth, despite a
   considerable ordinary heritability.
   IGEs change our perspective on the genetic architecture and potential
   response to selection. Depending on the correlation between direct and
   indirect genetic effects, IGEs may enhance or diminish the response to
   natural or artificial selection compared with that predicted from
   ordinary heritability.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic studies of social behaviour have currently received new impetus
   from models including indirect genetic effects (IGEs) of social
   partners. This study aimed at investigating the contribution of
   conspecifics in social dominance, considered as response of dyadic
   interaction that is, winning (dominant individual) or losing
   (subordinate). A genetic correlation of -1 is expected between the
   attitude to win and the attitude to loose, and because a population
   always accounts for half winners and half losers, the heritability of
   the dominant status should be close to zero. Specifically, social
   dominance was studied in Aosta Chestnut and Aosta Black Pied (Bos
   taurus) breeds, alpine rustic cattle famous for traditional tournaments
   where pairs of cows assess dominant status in bloodless fights. The
   outcomes of 25 590 dyadic interactions performed by 8159 individuals in
   11 years were analysed by applying a classical quantitative model and
   models including indirect effects. Data were analysed via Bayesian
   approach on a threshold trait. The assessment of variances revealed a
   genetic correlation of -0.976 between direct and indirect genetic
   components. The heritability measured on a liability scale was 0.122 for
   direct phenotype, but decreased to 0.014 when the total heritable
   variance (TBV) was considered. The trend of estimated breeding values
   showed that the total TBV was constant over the years, even though its
   direct component increased and the indirect part decreased. This result
   confirms the relevance of IGEs on social behaviour and the assumption
   that the mean individual social dominance cannot evolve within a
   population, due to the evolutionary constraints imposed by the `social
   environment'. Heredity (2013) 11, 3-9; doi:10.1038/hdy.2012.56;

Abstract = {{The widespread occurrence of female multiple mating (FMM) demands
   evolutionary explanation, particularly in the light of the costs of
   mating. One explanation encapsulated by good sperm and sexy-sperm
   (GS-SS) theoretical models is that FMM facilitates sperm competition,
   thus ensuring paternity by males that pass on genes for elevated sperm
   competitiveness to their male offspring. While support for this
   component of GS-SS theory is accumulating, a second but poorly tested
   assumption of these models is that there should be corresponding
   heritable genetic variation in FMM the proposed mechanism of
   postcopulatory preferences underlying GS-SS models. Here, we conduct
   quantitative genetic analyses on paternal half-siblings to test this
   component of GS-SS theory in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a
   freshwater fish with some of the highest known rates of FMM in
   vertebrates. As with most previous quantitative genetic analyses of FMM
   in other species, our results reveal high levels of phenotypic variation
   in this trait and a correspondingly low narrow-sense heritability
   (h2=0.11). Furthermore, although our analysis of additive genetic
   variance in FMM was not statistically significant (probably owing to
   limited statistical power), the ensuing estimate of mean-standardized
   additive genetic variance (IA=0.7) was nevertheless relatively low
   compared with estimates published for life-history traits across a broad
   range of taxa. Our results therefore add to a growing body of evidence
   that FMM is characterized by relatively low additive genetic variation,
   thus apparently contradicting GS-SS theory. However, we qualify this
   conclusion by drawing attention to potential deficiencies in most
   designs (including ours) that have tested for genetic variation in FMM,
   particularly those that fail to account for intersexual interactions
   that underlie FMM in many systems.}},

Abstract = {{Pigs may affect each other's health, welfare and productivity through
   their behaviour. The effect of a pig on the growth rate of its pen mates
   is partly heritable and is referred to as its social genetic effect.
   Social genetic effects, also known as indirect genetic effects, have
   been found in a number of livestock breeds, in natural and laboratory
   populations, and in plant breeding and forestry, and have become an
   important research topic in recent years. In pigs, social genetic
   effects are hypothesized to be related to behaviour. The mechanism
   behind social genetic effects for growth, as well as the relationship
   between behaviours and growth itself, is largely unknown. To gain
   insight in the mechanism behind social genetic effects, we investigated
   the relationship between behaviours and growth rate in pigs. On a
   commercial pig farm, 398 finishing pigs in 50 pens (eight pigs/pen) were
   observed at 12 weeks of age using 2-min instantaneous scan sampling for
   6 h during daytime. For 324 observed pigs, growth rate during the
   finishing period was known. The relationship between behaviours and
   growth rate during the finishing period was analysed with behaviour as
   explanatory variable in a mixed model. Results show that time spent
   giving behaviours, like oral manipulation, social nosing, aggression and
   belly nosing, was not related to own growth rate. Receiving behaviours,
   however, did relate to growth. Pigs that received more oral
   manipulation, observed as tail biting, ear biting and paw biting, grew
   less well (P < 0.05). Growth rate was 43(+/- 17) g/d lower in pigs that
   received oral manipulation during more than 2\% of the observations as
   compared to pigs that did not receive oral manipulation. Pigs that
   received social nosing, a gentle touch or sniff at any part of the body,
   had a higher growth rate (P < 0.05): growth rate differed 29(+/- 17)0
   between pigs that received social nosing during more than 2\% of
   observations as compared to not receiving social nosing at all.
   Receiving aggression and belly nosing, a forceful rubbing of the belly,
   did not influence growth rate. In conclusion, receiving oral
   manipulation and social nosing related to growth rate. This suggests
   that pigs selected for positive social genetic effects for growth may
   potentially show behavioural changes. Effects of selection for social
   genetic effects on behaviour and growth will be studied in future
   research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the behavioral consequences of selecting pigs using
   a social genetic model for growth. Calculations enable each member of a
   group of pigs to be given a direct breeding value (DBV) and a social
   breeding value (SBV), which can be summarized into a total breeding
   value (TBV) for growth. Selection for growth TBV could affect animal
   behavior because social effects account for within- group interactions.
   Data were recorded from 96 groups of Yorkshire and Yorkshire x Landrace
   pigs in a nucleus herd. Each group contained 15 pigs fed ad libitum from
   2 feeders; the space allowance was 0.85 m(2)/pig. Average daily gain was
   quantified from 35 to 100 kg of BW. Fighting and bullying activity at
   mixing (period 1), lying frequency 3 wk after mixing (period 2), and
   counts of skin lesions in periods 1 and 2 were recorded. The DBV for
   these traits were estimated with a classic animal model. We simulated
   different correlations between the direct genetic effect and the social
   genetic effect on growth rate ((DS)-D-r), 2 components that respectively
   determine a pig's genetic capacity to grow and its genetic influence on
   growth of group mates: rDS was successively assumed to be 0 and +/-
   0.12, +/- 0.20, +/- 0.29, and +/- 0.58. Finally, the correlations
   between DBV, SBV, and TBV for ADG, as well as the DBV for behavior and
   skin lesions, were calculated and tested for a level of significance at
   P < 0.05. The gradient from negative to positive values of rDS refers to
   a progressive path running from genetic antagonism to genetic mutualism
   for growth. If rDS in the population truly ranged between -0.58 and
   -0.20, correlations for TBV for ADG with DBV for fighting and bullying
   progressively increased with rDS. Consequently, if rDS was low (between
   -0.12 and +0.12) or positive (>+0.12), pigs with high TBV for ADG had
   higher DBV for bullying other pigs in the group and for fighting than
   pigs with lower TBV for ADG. Pigs with high TBV for ADG did not differ
   from other pigs in their DBV for lesions to the anterior part of the
   body, but they had a lower DBV for posterior lesions, whereas in period
   2, they had higher DBV for posterior lesions and lower DBV for lying.
   Under genetic mutualism for growth and in housing conditions similar to
   those in the present study, selection for growth TBV would promote the
   rapid establishment of the dominance relationships, with more aggressive
   contests among group mates at mixing. Pigs would subsequently be more
   active but, judging by skin lesions, less willing to fight in a more
   stable social situation.}},

Title = {{Phenotypic and Evolutionary Consequences of Social Behaviours:
   Interactions among Individuals Affect Direct Genetic Effects}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Traditional quantitative genetics assumes that an individual's phenotype
   is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. For many
   animals, part of the environment is social and provided by parents and
   other interacting partners. When expression of genes in social partners
   affects trait expression in a focal individual, indirect genetic effects
   occur. In this study, we explore the effects of indirect genetic effects
   on the magnitude and range of phenotypic values in a focal individual in
   a multi-member model analyzing three possible classes of interactions
   between individuals. We show that social interactions may not only cause
   indirect genetic effects but can also modify direct genetic effects.
   Furthermore, we demonstrate that both direct and indirect genetic
   effects substantially alter the range of phenotypic values, particularly
   when a focal trait can influence its own expression via interactions
   with traits in other individuals. We derive a function predicting the
   relative importance of direct versus indirect genetic effects. Our model
   reveals that both direct and indirect genetic effects can depend to a
   large extent on both group size and interaction strength, altering group
   mean phenotype and variance. This may lead to scenarios where between
   group variation is much higher than within group variation despite
   similar underlying genetic properties, potentially affecting the level
   of selection. Our analysis highlights key properties of indirect genetic
   effects with important consequences for trait evolution, the level of
   selection and potentially speciation.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3570-3581}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Knowledge of how genetic effects arising from parental care influence
   the evolution of offspring traits comes almost exclusively from studies
   of maternal care. However, males provide care in some taxa, and often
   this care differs from females in quality or quantity. If variation in
   paternal care is genetically based then, like maternal care and maternal
   effects, paternal effects may have important consequences for the
   evolution of offspring traits via indirect genetic effects (IGEs). IGEs
   and directindirect genetic covariances associated with parental care can
   contribute substantially to total heritability and influence predictions
   about how traits respond to selection. It is unknown, however, if the
   magnitude and sign of parental effects arising from fathers are the same
   as those arising from mothers. We used a reciprocal cross-fostering
   experiment to quantify environmental and genetic effects of paternal
   care on offspring performance in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus
   vespilloides. We found that IGEs were substantial and direct-indirect
   genetic covariances were negative. Combined, these patterns led to low
   total heritabilities for offspring performance traits. Thus, under
   paternal care, offspring performance traits are unlikely to evolve in
   response to selection, and variation in these traits will be maintained
   in the population despite potentially strong selection on these traits.
   These patterns are similar to those generated by maternal care,
   indicating that the genetic effects of care on offspring performance are
   independent of the caregiver's sex.}},

Abstract = {{A variety of theoretical models incorporate phenotypes expressed in the

   generate dynamics that alter evolution. This has proven to be a
   challenging and controversial proposition. However, several recent
   modelling frameworks provide insight: indirect genetic effect (IGE)
   models, niche construction models, and evolutionary feedback models.
   These distinct approaches converge upon the observation that gene action
   at a distance generates feedback that expands the range of trait values
   and evolutionary rates that we should expect to observe in empirical
   studies. Such conceptual replication provides solid evidence that traits
   with extended effects have important evolutionary consequences, but more
   empirical work is needed to evaluate the predictive power of different
   modelling approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Through social interactions, individuals can affect one another's
   phenotype. The heritable effect of an individual on the phenotype of a
   conspecific is known as an indirect genetic effect (IGE). Although IGEs
   can have a substantial impact on heritable variation and response to
   selection, little is known about the genetic architecture of traits
   affected by IGEs. We studied IGEs for survival in domestic chickens
   (Gallus gallus), using data on two purebred lines and their reciprocal
   cross. Birds were kept in groups of four. Feather pecking and
   cannibalism caused mortality, as beaks were kept intact. Survival time
   was shorter in crossbreds than in purebreds, indicating outbreeding
   depression and the presence of nonadditive genetic effects. IGEs
   contributed the majority of heritable variation in crossbreds (87 and
   72\%) and around half of heritable variation in purebreds (65 and 44\%).
   There was no evidence of dominance variance, neither direct nor
   indirect. Absence of dominance variance in combination with considerable
   outbreeding depression suggests that survival is affected by many loci.
   Direct-indirect genetic correlations were moderately to highly negative
   in crossbreds (-0.37 +/- 0.17 and -0.83 +/- 0.10), but low and not
   significantly different from zero in purebreds (-0.20 +/- 0.21 and -0.28
   +/- 0.18). Consequently, unlike purebreds, crossbreds would fail to
   respond positively to mass selection. The direct genetic correlation
   between both crosses was high (0.95 +/- 0.23), whereas the indirect
   genetic correlation was moderate (0.41 +/- 0.26). Thus, for IGEs, it
   mattered which parental line provided the sire and which provided the
   dam. This indirect parent-of-origin effect appeared to be paternally
   transmitted and is probably Z chromosome linked.}},

Abstract = {{Polyphenic traits are widespread, but compared to other traits,
   relatively few studies have explored the mechanisms that influence their
   inheritance. Here we investigated the relative importance of additive,
   nonadditive genetic, and parental sources of variation in the expression
   of polyphenic male dimorphism in the mite Rhizoglyphus echinopus, a
   species in which males are either fighters or scramblers. We established
   eight inbred lines through eight generations of full-sibling matings,
   and then crossed the inbred lines in a partial diallel design. Nymphs
   were isolated and raised to adulthood with ad libitum food. At
   adulthood, male morph was recorded for all male offspring. Using a
   CockerhamWeir model, we found strong paternal effects for this
   polyphenic trait that could be either linked to the Y chromosome of
   males or an indirect genetic effect that is environmentally transmitted.
   In additional analyses, we were able to corroborate the paternal effects
   but also detected significant additive effects questioning the
   CockerhamWeir analysis. This study reveals the potential importance of
   paternal effects on the expression of polyphenic traits and sheds light
   on the complex genetic architecture of these traits.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when genes expressed in one
   individual affect the phenotype of a conspecific. Theoretical models
   indicate that the evolutionary consequences of IGEs critically depend on
   the genetic architecture of interacting traits, and on the strength and
   direction of phenotypic effects arising from social interactions, which
   can be quantified by the interaction coefficient Psi. In the context of
   sexually selected traits, strong positive Psi tends to exaggerate
   evolutionary change, whereas negative Psi impedes sexual trait
   elaboration. Despite its theoretical importance, whether and how Psi
   varies among geographically distinct populations is unknown. Such
   information is necessary to evaluate the potential for IGEs to
   contribute to divergence among isolated or semi-isolated populations.
   Here, we report substantial variation in Psi for a behavioural trait
   involved in sexual selection in the field cricket Teleogryllus
   oceanicus: female choosiness. Both the strength and direction of Psi
   varied among geographically isolated populations. Psi also changed over
   time. In a contemporary population of crickets from Kauai, experience of
   male song increased female choosiness. In contrast, experience of male
   song decreased choosiness in an ancestral population from the same
   location. This rapid change corroborates studies examining the
   evolvability of Psi and demonstrates how interpopulation variation in
   the interaction coefficient might influence sexual selection and
   accelerate divergence of traits influenced by IGEs that contribute to
   reproductive isolation in nascent species or subspecies.}},

Abstract = {{Behaviors toward heterospecifics and conspecifics may be correlated
   because of shared mechanisms of expression in both social contexts
   (nonadaptive covariation) or because correlational selection favors
   adaptive covariation. We evaluated these hypotheses by comparing
   behavior toward conspecifics and heterospecifics in brook stickleback
   (Culaea inconstans) from three populations sympatric with and three
   allopatric from a competitor, the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius
   pungitius). Behavioral traits were classified into three multivariate
   components: overt aggression, sociability, and activity. The correlation
   of behavior between social contexts for both overt aggression and
   activity varied among populations in a way unrelated to sympatry with
   ninespine stickleback, while mean aggression was reduced in sympatry.
   Correlations in allopatric populations suggest that overt aggression and
   activity may genetically covary between social contexts for nonadaptive
   reasons. Sociability was rarely correlated in allopatry but was
   consistently correlated in sympatry despite reduced mean sociability,
   suggesting that correlational selection may favor a sociability syndrome
   in brook stickleback when they coexist with ninespine stickleback. Thus,
   interspecific competition may impose diversifying selection on behavior
   among populations, although the causes of correlated behavior toward
   conspecifics and heterospecifics and whether it can evolve in one social
   context independent of the other may depend on the type of behavior.}},

Volume = {{90}},

Pages = {{2907-2915}},

Abstract = {{Aosta Black Pied (ABP) and Aosta Chestnut (AC) are dual-purpose cattle
   indigenous to the western Alps and famous for their fighting ability in
   traditional Italian Batailles de Reines. The present study aimed to
   investigate the influence of inbreeding on breeding values for fighting
   ability achieved in participants. Inbreeding (F) and average relatedness
   (AR) were obtained from the entire pedigree information available
   (19,554 and 87,967 records for ABP and AC, respectively). Data (n =
   23,998) relating to 8,259 cows competing in years 2001-2009 were
   analyzed to obtain heritability (h(2)) estimates and breeding values for
   the trait. A placement score was chosen as a phenotype for fighting
   ability and both a classical quantitative model (NORM) and its
   implementation, used to identify its indirect genetic effects (COMP),
   were analyzed using the expectation maximization-REML (EM-REML) method.
   The F and AR trends in animals born between 1990 and 2009 were generally
   low and were greater for ABP (+ 0.06\%/yr) than for AC (+ 0.03\%/yr)
   populations, which also presented a greater mean F (about 2.8\% +/-
   1.7\% vs. 0.8\% +/- 1.5\% for ABP and AC, respectively) and mean AR
   among individuals (about 1.0\% +/- 0.8\% vs. 0.4\% +/- 0.3\% for ABP and
   AC, respectively). Heritability estimates from 0.083 +/- 0.036 to 0.120
   +/- 0.037 were obtained using the NORM model, accounting for or not
   accounting for F, respectively. Similar results were obtained also for
   the COMP model, with h(2) estimates of 0.12 +/- 0.037, whether or not F
   was taken into consideration. Linear regression analyses carried out on
   the 33 major lineages to which most of participants belonged (n = 6,087)
   revealed an overall negative trend of EBV compared with the increase of
   either F (b = -21.3, P < 0.01) or AR (b = -50.1, P < 0.01). However, a
   great variability in the relationship between EBV and F or AR was found
   by analyzing data within lineages. Despite the variability, an
   unfavorable effect of inbreeding was detected in the fighting ability
   trait of both ABP and AC cattle, and this should be carefully considered
   in the breeding management of both breeds.}},

Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Consistent individual variation in behaviour is widespread across taxa
   and behavioural categories. Because social behaviour is often a plastic
   response to the social environment, consistent variation in social
   behaviours such as aggression and cooperation may generate consistent
   variation in the behaviour of social partners and others in the group.
   In this study, we moved individual subordinate males between groups of a
   cooperatively breeding cichlid, Neolamprologus pulcher. We found that
   subordinate males varied consistently in their aggressive interactions
   with neighbouring fish. The effects of individual subordinate males
   extended beyond their direct interactions; agonistic interactions
   between dominant males and dominant females varied consistently with
   subordinate male identity. We suggest that variation in helping
   behaviour through territorial defence influences the net fitness effects
   of subordinate males on dominant males and, thus, the potential for
   conflict between dominant males and dominant females over subordinate
   male presence. The existence of indirect phenotypic effects of
   subordinate males on interactions not directly involving the subordinate
   male suggests that individual personalities extend into the social
   environment and may be an important selective influence on social
   behaviour and on variation among social groups. (C) 2012 The Association

Abstract = {{Female mating preferences are often flexible, reflecting the social
   environment in which they are expressed. Associated indirect genetic
   effects (IGEs) can affect the rate and direction of evolutionary change,
   but sexual selection models do not capture these dynamics. We
   incorporate IGEs into quantitative genetic models to explore how
   variation in social environments and mate choice flexibility influence
   Fisherian sexual selection. The importance of IGEs is that runaway
   sexual selection can occur in the absence of a genetic correlation
   between male traits and female preferences. Social influences can
   facilitate the initiation of the runaway process and increase the rate
   of trait elaboration. Incorporating costs to choice do not alter the
   main findings. Our model provides testable predictions: (1) genetic
   covariances between male traits and female preferences may not exist,
   (2) social flexibility in female choice will be common in populations
   experiencing strong sexual selection, (3) variation in social
   environments should be associated with rapid sexual trait divergence,
   and (4) secondary sexual traits will be more elaborate than previously
   predicted. Allowing feedback from the social environment resolves
   discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical data, such
   as why indirect selection on female preferences, theoretically weak,
   might be sufficient for preferences to become elaborated.}},

Abstract = {{Social selection influences the evolution of weapons, ornaments and
   behaviour in both males and females. Thus, social interactions in both
   sexual and non-sexual contexts can have a powerful influence on the
   evolution of traits that would otherwise appear to be detrimental to
   survival. Although clearly outlined by West-Eberhard in the early 1980s,
   the idea that social selection is a comprehensive framework for the
   study of ornaments and weapons has largely been ignored. In
   West-Eberhard's view, sexual selection is a form of social selection-a
   concept supported by several lines of evidence. Darwin's distinction
   between natural and sexual selection has been useful, but recent
   confusion about the limits of sexual selection suggests that some traits
   are not easily categorized as naturally or sexually selected. Because
   social selection theory has much to offer the current debates about both
   sexual selection and reproductive competition in females, it is
   sometimes viewed, narrowly, to be most useful when considering female
   roles. However, social selection theory encompasses much more than
   female reproductive competition. Our goal here was to provide that
   broader perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Ornaments, weapons and aggressive behaviours may evolve in female
   animals by mate choice and intrasexual competition for mating
   opportunities-the standard forms of sexual selection in males. However,
   a growing body of evidence suggests that selection tends to operate in
   different ways in males and females, with female traits more often
   mediating competition for ecological resources, rather than mate
   acquisition. Two main solutions have been proposed to accommodate this
   disparity. One is to expand the concept of sexual selection to include
   all mechanisms related to fecundity; another is to adopt an alternative
   conceptual framework-the theory of social selection-in which sexual
   selection is one component of a more general form of selection resulting
   from all social interactions. In this study, we summarize the history of
   the debate about female ornaments and weapons, and discuss potential
   resolutions. We review the components of fitness driving ornamentation
   in a wide range of systems, and show that selection often falls outside
   the limits of traditional sexual selection theory, particularly in
   females. We conclude that the evolution of these traits in both sexes is
   best understood within the unifying framework of social selection.}},

Abstract = {{In the pig industry, male piglets are surgically castrated early in life
   to prevent boar taint. Boar taint is mainly caused by androstenone and
   skatole. Androstenone is a pheromone that can be released from the
   salivary glands when the boar is sexually aroused. Boars are housed in
   groups and as a consequence boars can influence and be influenced by the
   phenotype of other boars by (non-) heritable social interactions. The
   influence of these social interactions on androstenone is not well
   understood. The objective of this study is to investigate whether
   androstenone concentrations are affected by (non-) heritable social
   interactions and estimate their genetic correlation with growth rate and
   backfat. The dataset contained 6,245 boars, of which 4,455 had
   androstenone observations (68\%). The average number of animals per pen
   was 7 and boars were housed in 899 unique pen-groups (boars within a
   single pen) and 344 unique compartment-groups (boars within a unique
   `room' within a barn during time). Four models including different
   random effects, were compared for androstenone. Direct genetic,
   associative (also known as social genetic or indirect genetic effects),
   group, compartment, common environment and residual effects were
   included as random effects in the full model (M3). Including random pen
   and compartment effects (non- heritable social effects) significantly
   improved the model (M2) compared with including only direct, common
   environment and residual as random effects (M1, P < 0.001), and
   including associative effects even more (M3, P < 0.001). The sum of the
   direct and associative variance components determines the total genetic
   variance of the trait. The associative effect explained 11.7\% of the
   total genetic variance. Backfat thickness was analysed using M2 and
   growth using M3. The genetic correlation between backfat (direct genetic
   variance) and total genetic variance for androstenone was close to 0.
   Backfat and the direct and associative effects for androstenone had
   genetic correlations of 0.14 +/- 0.08 and -0.25 +/- 0.18, respectively.
   The genetic correlation between total genetic variances for growth rate
   and androstenone was 0.33 +/- 0.18. The genetic correlation between
   direct effects was 0.11 +/- 0.09 and between associative effects was
   0.42 +/- 0.31. The genetic correlations and current selection towards
   lower backfat and greater growth rate suggest that no major change in
   androstenone is expected when breeding goals are not changed. For
   selection against boar taint and therefore also against androstenone,
   results recommend that at least the social environment of the boars
   should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal care has been suggested to evolve more readily in haplodiploid
   populations. Because maternal care appears to have been a prerequisite
   for the evolution of eusociality, this effect potentially explains the
   apparent preponderance of haplodiploidy among eusocial taxa. Here, I use
   a kin selection approach to model the evolution of maternal care in
   diploid and haplodiploid populations. In contrast to previous
   suggestions, I find that haplodiploidy may inhibit as well as promote
   the evolution of maternal care. Moreover, I find that the haplodiploidy
   effect vanishes in outbred populations if gene effects average rather
   than add together. I confirm these analytical results using numerical
   simulation of an explicit population genetics model. This analysis casts
   doubt upon the idea that haplodiploidy has promoted the evolution of
   maternal care and, consequently, the evolution of eusociality.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the evolution of altruism requires knowledge of both its
   constraints and its drivers. Here we show that, paradoxically,
   ecological constraints on altruism may ultimately be its strongest
   driver. We construct a two-trait, coevolutionary adaptive dynamics model
   of social evolution in a genetically structured population with local
   resource competition. The intensity of local resource competition, which
   influences the direction and strength of social selection and which is
   typically treated as a static parameter, is here allowed to be an
   evolvable trait. Evolution of survival/fecundity altruism, which
   requires weak local competition, increases local competition as it
   evolves, creating negative environmental feedback that ultimately
   inhibits its further evolutionary advance. Alternatively, evolution of
   resource-based altruism, which requires strong local competition,
   weakens local competition as it evolves, also ultimately causing its own
   evolution to stall. When evolving independently, these altruistic
   strategies are intrinsically self-limiting. However, the coexistence of
   these two altruism types transforms the negative ecoevolutionary
   feedback generated by each strategy on itself into positive feedback on
   the other, allowing the presence of one trait to drive the evolution of
   the other. We call this feedback conversion reciprocal niche
   construction. In the absence of constraints, this process leads to
   runaway coevolution of altruism types. We discuss applications to the
   origins and evolution of eusociality, division of labor, the inordinate
   ecological success of eusocial species, and the interaction between
   technology and demography in human evolution. Our theory suggests that
   the evolution of extreme sociality may often be an autocatalytic
   process.}},

Abstract = {{In many traits involved in social interactions, such as courtship and
   aggression, the phenotype is an outcome of interactions between
   individuals. Such traits whose expression in an individual is partly
   determined by the phenotype of its social partner are called interacting
   phenotypes. Quantitative genetic models suggested that interacting
   phenotypes can evolve much faster than nonsocial traits. Current models,
   however, consider the interaction between phenotypes of social partners
   as a fixed phenotypic response rule, represented by an interaction
   coefficient (?). Here, we extend existing theoretical models and
   incorporate the interaction coefficient as a trait that can evolve. We
   find that the evolution of the interaction coefficient can change
   qualitatively the predictions about the rate and direction of evolution
   of interacting phenotypes. We argue that it is crucial to determine
   whether and how the phenotypic response of an individual to its social
   partner can evolve to make accurate predictions about the evolution of
   traits involved in social interactions.}},

Title = {{Indirect Genetic Effects and the Spread of Infectious Disease: Are We
   Capturing the Full Heritable Variation Underlying Disease Prevalence?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 29}},
Abstract = {{Reducing disease prevalence through selection for host resistance offers
   a desirable alternative to chemical treatment. Selection for host
   resistance has proven difficult, however, due to low heritability
   estimates. These low estimates may be caused by a failure to capture all
   the relevant genetic variance in disease resistance, as genetic analysis
   currently is not taylored to estimate genetic variation in infectivity.
   Host infectivity is the propensity of transmitting infection upon
   contact with a susceptible individual, and can be regarded as an
   indirect effect to disease status. It may be caused by a combination of
   physiological and behavioural traits. Though genetic variation in
   infectivity is difficult to measure directly, Indirect Genetic Effect
   (IGE) models, also referred to as associative effects or social
   interaction models, allow the estimation of this variance from more
   readily available binary disease data (infected/non-infected). We
   therefore generated binary disease data from simulated populations with
   known amounts of variation in susceptibility and infectivity to test the
   adequacy of traditional and IGE models. Our results show that a
   conventional model fails to capture the genetic variation in infectivity
   inherent in populations with simulated infectivity. An IGE model, on the
   other hand, does capture some of the variation in infectivity.
   Comparison with expected genetic variance suggests that there is scope
   for further methodological improvement, and that potential responses to
   selection may be greater than values presented here. Nonetheless,
   selection using an index of estimated direct and indirect breeding
   values was shown to have a greater genetic selection differential and
   reduced future disease risk than traditional selection for resistance
   only. These findings suggest that if genetic variation in infectivity
   substantially contributes to disease transmission, then breeding designs
   which explicitly incorporate IGEs might help reduce disease prevalence.}},

Abstract = {{In Drosophila melanogaster, biological rhythms, aggression and mating
   are modulated by group size and composition. However, the fitness
   significance of this group effect is unknown. By varying the composition
   of groups of males and females, we show that social context affects
   reproductive behaviour and offspring genetic diversity. Firstly, females
   mating with males from the same strain in the presence of males from a
   different strain are infecund, analogous to the Bruce effect in rodents,
   suggesting a social context-dependent inbreeding avoidance mechanism.
   Secondly, females mate more frequently in groups composed of males from
   more than one strain; this mitigates last male sperm precedence and
   increases offspring genetic diversity. However, smell-impaired Orco
   mutant females do not increase mating frequency according to group
   composition; this indicates that social context-dependent changes in
   reproductive behaviour depend on female olfaction, rather than direct
   male-male interactions. Further, variation in mating frequency in
   wild-type strains depends on females and not males. The data show that
   group composition can affect variance in the reproductive success of its
   members, and that females play a central role in this process. Social
   environment can thus influence the evolutionary process.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{Multilevel selection has rarely been studied in the ecological context
   of animal populations, in which neighbourhood effects range from
   competition among territorial neighbours to source-sink effects among
   local populations. By studying a Dupont's lark Chersophilus duponti
   metapopulation, we analyze neighbourhood effects mediated by song
   repertoires on fitness components at the individual level (life-span)
   and population level (growth rate). As a sexual/aggressive signal with
   strong effects on fitness, birdsong creates an opportunity for group
   selection via neighbour interactions, but may also have population-wide
   effects by conveying information on habitat suitability to dispersing
   individuals. Within populations, we found a disruptive pattern of
   selection at the individual level and an opposite, stabilizing pattern
   at the group level. Males singing the most complex songs had the longest
   life-span, but individuals with the poorest repertoires lived longer
   than `average' males, a finding that likely reflects two male strategies
   with respect to fitness and sexual trait expression. Individuals from
   groups with intermediate repertoires had the longest life-span, likely
   benefitting from conspecific signalling to attract females up to the
   detrimental spread of competitive interactions in groups with superior
   vocal skills. Within the metapopulation selection was directional but
   again followed opposite patterns at the two levels: Populations had the
   highest growth rate when inhabiting local patches with complex
   repertoires surrounded by patches with simple repertoires. Here the song
   may impact metapopulation dynamics by guiding prospecting individuals
   towards populations advertising habitat quality. Two fitness components
   linked to viability were therefore influenced by the properties of the
   group, and birdsong was the target of selection, contributing to linking
   social/sexual processes at the local scale with regional population
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{1. Direct ecological effects of biological invasions have been widely
   documented, but indirect genetic effects on native species are poorly
   known. In many cases, this is because of the lack of information on the
   genetic structure of species affected by invasions. 2. We used
   microsatellite DNA loci to estimate the genetic structure and gene flow
   patterns of Galaxias maculatus, a galaxiid fish endemic to the southern
   hemisphere, which is increasingly being threatened by salmonid
   invasions. 3. Analysis of nine diadromous populations of G.similar to
   maculatus in Chilean Patagonia (an area heavily impacted by farming of
   non-native salmonids) indicates that dispersal is mostly a passive
   process, seemingly driven by wind and currents and resulting in high
   gene flow and weak population structuring. 4. Gene flow was
   asymmetrical, with three populations acting as sources and six
   populations acting as sinks. Sinks had lower habitat quality and had a
   greater incidence of adults than sources, which consisted mostly of
   juveniles. 5. Rivers invaded by salmonid escapees experienced
   significantly higher aquaculture pressure than rivers where salmonid
   escapees were apparently absent, but no effect on genetic diversity of
   G.similar to maculatus could be detected. 6. We discuss whether salmonid
   aquaculture might affect the demography and connectivity of galaxiid
   metapopulations: indirectly through habitat alteration and directly
   through escapes of predatory fish.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships among the members of a population can be visualized
   using individual networks, where each individual is a node connected to
   each other by means of links describing the interactions. The centrality
   of a given node captures its importance within the network. We
   hypothesize that in mutualistic networks, the centrality of a node
   should benefit its fitness. We test this idea studying eight
   individual-based networks originated from the interaction between
   Erysimum mediohispanicum and its flower visitors. In these networks,
   each plant was considered a node and was connected to conspecifics
   sharing flower visitors. Centrality indicates how well connected is a
   given E. mediohispanicum individual with the rest of the co-occurring
   conspecifics because of sharing flower visitors. The centrality was
   estimated by three network metrics: betweenness, closeness and degree.
   The complex relationship between centrality, phenotype and fitness was
   explored by structural equation modelling. We found that the centrality
   of a plant was related to its fitness, with plants occupying central
   positions having higher fitness than those occupying peripheral
   positions. The structural equation models (SEMs) indicated that the
   centrality effect on fitness was not merely an effect of the abundance
   of visits and the species richness of visitors. Centrality has an effect
   even when simultaneously accounting for these predictors. The SEMs also
   indicated that the centrality effect on fitness was because of the
   specific phenotype of each plant, with attractive plants occupying
   central positions in networks, in relation to the distribution of
   conspecific phenotypes. This finding suggests that centrality, owing to
   its dependence on social interactions, may be an appropriate surrogate
   for the interacting phenotype of individuals.}},

Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Sexual selection arises from social interactions, and if social
   environments vary so too should sexual selection. For example, malemale
   competition often occurs either in the presence or in the absence of
   females, and such changes in the social environment could affect the
   form and strength of sexual selection. Here we examine how the presence
   of a female influences selection arising from malemale competition in a
   leaf-footed cactus bug, Narnia femorata, which has a resource defence
   mating system. Males compete for territories on cacti because females
   lay eggs on the cactus plants. Females are not always present when this
   competition first occurs; however, the presence or absence of the female
   matters. We found that both the form and strength of selection on male
   traits, those traits that influenced success in intrasexual competition,
   depended on the social context. When a female was not present, male size
   and the area of the sexually dimorphic hind legs was only marginally
   important to winning a contest. However, males with larger overall size
   and leg area were more likely to win in the presence of a female. There
   was also positive quadratic selection on these traits when a female was
   present with both the largest and the smallest males winning. The
   implication is unexpected alternative strategies when females are
   present. Our results support the notion that sexual selection should be
   studied under all relevant social contexts.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{890-895}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Social interactions have a powerful effect on the evolutionary process.
   Recent attempts to synthesize models of social selection with equations
   for indirect genetic effects (McGlothlin et al. 2010) provide a broad
   theoretical base from which to study selection and evolutionary response
   in the context of social interactions. However, this framework concludes
   that social selection will lead to evolution only if the traits carried
   by social partners are nonrandomly associated. I suggest this conclusion
   is incomplete, and that traits that do not covary between social
   partners can nevertheless lead to evolution via interactive effects on
   fitness. Such effects occur when there are functional interactions
   between traits, and as an example I use the interplay in water striders
   (Gerridae) between grasping appendages carried by males and spines by
   females. Functional interactive effects between traits can be
   incorporated into both the equations for social selection and the
   general model of social evolution proposed by McGlothlin et al. These
   expanded equations would accommodate adaptive coevolution in social
   interactions, integrate the quantitative genetic approach to social
   evolution with game theoretical approaches, and stimulate some new
   questions about the process of social evolution.}},

Title = {{Mixing of Honeybees with Different Genotypes Affects Individual Worker
   Behavior and Transcription of Genes in the Neuronal Substrate}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{FEB 14}},
Abstract = {{Division of labor in social insects has made the evolution of collective
   traits possible that cannot be achieved by individuals alone.
   Differences in behavioral responses produce variation in engagement in
   behavioral tasks, which as a consequence, generates a division of labor.
   We still have little understanding of the genetic components influencing
   these behaviors, although several candidate genomic regions and genes
   influencing individual behavior have been identified. Here, we report
   that mixing of worker honeybees with different genotypes influences the
   expression of individual worker behaviors and the transcription of genes
   in the neuronal substrate. These indirect genetic effects arise in a
   colony because numerous interactions between workers produce interacting
   phenotypes and genotypes across organisms. We studied hygienic behavior
   of honeybee workers, which involves the cleaning of diseased brood cells
   in the colony. We mixed,500 newly emerged honeybee workers with
   genotypes of preferred Low (L) and High (H) hygienic behaviors. The L/H
   genotypic mixing affected the behavioral engagement of L worker bees in
   a hygienic task, the cooperation among workers in uncapping single brood
   cells, and switching between hygienic tasks. We found no evidence that
   recruiting and task-related stimuli are the primary source of the
   indirect genetic effects on behavior. We suggested that behavioral
   responsiveness of L bees was affected by genotypic mixing and found
   evidence for changes in the brain in terms of 943 differently expressed
   genes. The functional categories of cell adhesion, cellular component
   organization, anatomical structure development, protein localization,
   developmental growth and cell morphogenesis were overrepresented in this
   set of 943 genes, suggesting that indirect genetic effects can play a
   role in modulating and modifying the neuronal substrate. Our results
   suggest that genotypes of social partners affect the behavioral
   responsiveness and the neuronal substrate of individual workers,
   indicating a complex genetic architecture underlying the expression of
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{An unresolved controversy regarding social behaviors is exemplified when
   natural selection might lead to behaviors that maximize fitness at the
   social-group level but are costly at the individual level. Except for
   the special case of groups of clones, we do not have a general
   understanding of how and when group-optimal behaviors evolve, especially
   when the behaviors in question are flexible. To address this question,
   we develop a general model that integrates behavioral plasticity in
   social interactions with the action of natural selection in structured
   populations. We find that group-optimal behaviors can evolve, even
   without clonal groups, if individuals exhibit appropriate behavioral
   responses to each other's actions. The evolution of such behavioral
   responses, in turn, is predicated on the nature of the proximate
   behavioral mechanisms. We model a particular class of proximate
   mechanisms, prosocial preferences, and find that such preferences evolve
   to sustain maximum group benefit under certain levels of relatedness and
   certain ecological conditions. Thus, our model demonstrates the
   fundamental interplay between behavioral responses and relatedness in
   determining the course of social evolution. We also highlight the
   crucial role of proximate mechanisms such as prosocial preferences in
   the evolution of behavioral responses and in facilitating evolutionary
   transitions in individuality.}},

Abstract = {{Direct and interactive effect (individual and maternal heterosis) was
   estimated using data from rotational crosses between Holsteins with
   Iranian native breeds. Traits of interest were milk yield, fat yield,
   fat percent and milk days. Complete data were available on 155 240
   animals from 1991 through 2003. Direct additive's effect, individual
   heterosis, maternal heterosis and recombination (interactions between
   presences of Holstein gene in two parents) effects were estimated by
   multiple regression method in SAS 8.2 with mixed models procedure. The
   least squares means of milk yield, fat yield, fat percent and milk days
   were 2722.68 +/- 1 541.12 kg, 122.97 +/- 47.40 kg, 3.97 +/- 0.73 percent
   and 260.10 +/- 89.51 days respectively. All direct and indirect genetic
   effects are significant in milk and milk days traits (P<0.05).
   Individual and maternal heterosis and recombination effect are not
   significant on fat yield and fat percent traits. The individual and
   recombination effect were negative effect on milk yield. The result
   suggested that the Holstein is a favourable breed for crossbreeding
   program in developing country as Iran.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of heritability and genetic correlations are of central
   importance in the study of adaptive trait evolution and genetic
   constraints. We use a paternal half-sib-full-sib breeding design to
   investigate the genetic architecture of three life-history and
   morphological traits in the seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus.
   Heritability was significant for all traits under observation and
   genetic correlations between traits (r(A)) were low. Interestingly, we
   found substantial sex-specific genetic effects and low genetic
   correlations between sexes (r(MF)) in traits that are only moderately
   (weight at emergence) to slightly (longevity) sexually dimorphic.
   Furthermore, we found an increased sire (s(sire)(2)) compared to
   dam(s(dam)(2)) variance component within trait and sex. Our results
   highlight that the genetic architecture even of the same trait should
   not be assumed to be the same for males and females. Furthermore, it
   raises the issue of the presence of unnoticed environmental effects that
   may inflate estimates of heritability. Overall, our study stresses the
   fact that estimates of quantitative genetic parameters are not only
   population, time, environment, but also sex specific. Thus,
   extrapolation between sexes and studies should be treated with caution.}},

Abstract = {{Social networks describe the pattern of intraspecific interactions
   within a population. An individuals position in a social network often
   is expected to influence its fitness, but only a few studies have
   examined this relationship in natural populations. We investigated the
   fitness consequences of network position in a wild beetle population.
   Copulation success of male beetles positively covaried with strength (a
   measure of network centrality) and negatively covaried with clustering
   coefficient (CC) (a measure of cliquishness). Further analysis using
   mediation path models suggested that the activity level of individuals
   drove the relationships between strength and fitness almost entirely. In
   contrast, selection on CC was not explained by individual behaviours.
   Although our data suggest that social network position can experience
   strong sexual selection, it is also clear that the relationships between
   fitness and some network metrics merely reflect variation in
   individual-level behaviours.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-19}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In a model based on the wasp family Vespidae, the origin of worker
   behaviour, which constitutes the eusociality threshold, is not based on
   relatedness, therefore the origin of eusociality does not depend on
   inclusive fitness, and workers at the eusociality threshold are not
   altruistic. Instead, incipient workers and queens behave selfishly and
   are subject to direct natural selection. Beyond the eusociality
   threshold, relatedness enables soft inheritance as the framework for
   initial adaptations of eusociality. At the threshold of irreversibility,
   queen and worker castes become fixed in advanced eusociality.
   Transitions from solitary to facultative, facultative to primitive, and
   primitive to advanced eusociality occur via exaptation, phenotypic
   accommodation and genetic assimilation. Multilevel selection
   characterizes the solitary to highly eusocial transition, but components
   of multilevel selection vary across levels of eusociality. Roles of
   behavioural flexibility and developmental plasticity in the evolutionary
   process equal or exceed those of genotype.}},

Journal = {{GENETICS}},
Year = {{2011}},

Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Genetic selection is a major force shaping life on earth. In classical
   genetic theory, response to selection is the product of the strength of
   selection and the additive genetic variance in a trait. The additive
   genetic variance reflects a population's intrinsic potential to respond
   to selection. The ordinary additive genetic variance, however, ignores
   the social organization of life. With social interactions among
   individuals, individual trait values may depend on genes in others, a
   phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects. Models accounting for
   indirect genetic effects, however, lack a general definition of
   heritable variation. Here I propose a general definition of the
   heritable variation that determines the potential of a population to
   respond to selection. This generalizes the concept of heritable variance
   to any inheritance model and level of organization. The result shows
   that heritable variance determining potential response to selection is
   the variance among individuals in the heritable quantity that determines
   the population mean trait value, rather than the usual additive genetic
   component of phenotypic variance. It follows, therefore, that heritable
   variance may exceed phenotypic variance among individuals, which is
   impossible in classical theory. This work also provides a measure of the
   utilization of heritable variation for response to selection and
   integrates two well-known models of maternal genetic effects. The result
   shows that relatedness between the focal individual and the individuals
   affecting its fitness is a key determinant of the utilization of
   heritable variance for response to selection.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions often have major fitness consequences, but little is
   known about how specific interacting phenotypes affect the strength of
   natural selection. Social influences on the evolutionary process can be
   assessed using a multilevel selection approach that partitions the
   effects of social partner phenotypes on fitness (referred to as social
   or group selection) from those of the traits of a focal individual
   (nonsocial or individual selection). To quantify the contribution of
   social selection to total selection affecting a trait, the patterns of
   phenotypic association among interactants must also be considered. We
   estimated selection gradients on male body size in a wild population of
   forked fungus beetles (Bolitotherus cornutus). We detected positive
   nonsocial selection and negative social selection on body size operating
   through differences in copulation success, indicating that large males
   with small social partners had highest fitness. In addition, we found
   that, in low-density demes, the phenotypes of focal individuals were
   negatively correlated with those of their social partners. This pattern
   reversed the negative effect of group selection on body size and led to
   stronger positive selection for body size. Our results demonstrate
   multilevel selection in nature and stress the importance of considering
   social selection whenever conspecific interactions occur nonrandomly.}},

Abstract = {{Relatively few investigations explicitly test for concordant versus
   conflicting selection pressures from intrasexual versus intersexual
   selection. Here, we examine the effects of male body mass and behavioral
   type (BT) on reproductive success in the spider Anelosimus studiosus,
   with emphasis placed on the potential interaction between intrasexual
   and intersexual selection influences. Female A. studiosus exhibit either
   an aggressive-active or docile-passive BT, both of which co-occur in
   multifemale colonies. Males, in contrast, exhibit a more continuous
   distribution of behavioral tendencies. We investigated the male traits
   favored by females in five trial types: one docile female, one
   aggressive female, four docile females, four aggressive females, and two
   docile and two aggressive females. Male reproductive success was
   estimated by the number eggs produced by females following staged mating
   trials. In previous work, it was established that large aggressive males
   are favored in male male contests, an intrasexual effect. However, large
   aggressive males were not universally favored here. We failed to detect
   an effect of male body mass or aggressiveness on reproductive success in
   trials with all docile females; however, in situations involving
   aggressive females, large aggressive males experienced diminished
   reproductive success relative to small docile males. Large, aggressive
   males were also more likely to be attacked and killed by aggressive
   females in the first 20 min of staged encounters and were more likely to
   be found dead after 72 h of unobserved interactions. Taken together, our
   data suggest that the reproductive consequences of male traits differ
   based on (1) the aspect of sexual selection being considered
   (intrasexual versus intersexual) and (2) the BT of their prospective
   mates: large aggressive males enjoy advantages in intrasexual selection
   and when courting docile females and small docile males experience
   reduced risk of cannibalism and increased reproductive success with
   aggressive females.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive effort, egg number and egg size are traditionally
   considered to be `female' life history traits. However, females often
   adjust the amount of resources allocated to reproduction depending on
   their mate, causing male environmental effects on life history traits.
   If females respond to male traits which are genetically variable, then
   male environmental effects contain indirect genetic effects. Estimates
   of how much of the total variation in life history traits originates
   from female effects versus male environmental effects, seems mostly
   lacking. We have investigated variation in rates of egg production and
   in egg size in the annual Argentinian blackfin pearl killifish
   Austrolebias nigripinnis, in a crossed design where males were exchanged
   repeatedly between females. Our analysis of phenotypic variance
   components of reproductive effort, egg size and egg number indicates
   that the amount of variation contributed by male environmental effects
   is equal (egg size, reproductive effort) or larger (egg number) than
   that between females. For egg size and number, we find that male
   environmental effects consist of a male random effect representing the
   average response of females to male phenotype, plus a female-male
   interaction term. This term can be understood as the deviation from the
   population mean of an individual female's response. For reproductive
   effort, we find that the male environmental effect consists of an
   interaction term only. Random effects on egg size and number
   additionally vary in magnitude depending on the weekday where we
   collected eggs, probably due to cyclic variation in experimental
   conditions. Since we find that both male phenotype and environmental
   conditions affect egg size and number as determined by females, our
   results suggest that selection on these life history traits will be
   frequency-dependent.}},

Abstract = {{Social evolution in honey bees has produced strong queen-worker
   dimorphism for plastic traits that depend on larval nutrition. The honey
   bee developmental programme includes both larval components that
   determine plastic growth responses to larval nutrition and nurse
   components that regulate larval nutrition. We studied how these two
   components contribute to variation in worker and queen body size and
   ovary size for two pairs of honey bee lineages that show similar
   differences in worker body-ovary size allometry but have diverged over
   different evolutionary timescales. Our results indicate that the
   lineages have diverged for both nurse and larval developmental
   components, that rapid changes in worker body-ovary size allometry may
   disrupt queen development and that queen-worker dimorphism arises mainly
   from discrete nurse-provided nutritional environments, not from a
   developmental switch that converts variable nutritional environments
   into discrete phenotypes. Both larval and nurse components have likely
   contributed to the evolution of queen-worker dimorphism.}},

Abstract = {{Gene-environment correlation (rGE) occurs when an individual's genotype
   determines its choice of environment, generating a correlation between
   environment and genotype frequency. In particular, social rGE, caused by
   genetic variation in social environment choice, can critically determine
   both individual development and the course of social selection. Despite
   its foundational role in social evolution and developmental psychology
   theory, natural genetic variation in social environment choice has
   scarcely been examined empirically. Drosophila melanogaster provides an
   ideal system for investigating social rGE. Flies live socially in nature
   and have many opportunities to make social decisions; and natural,
   heterozygous genotypes may be replicated, enabling comparisons between
   genotypes across environments. Using this approach, I show that all
   aspects of social environment choice vary among natural genotypes,
   demonstrating pervasive social rGE. Surprisingly, genetic variation in
   group-size preference was density dependent, indicating that the
   behavioral and evolutionary consequences of rGE may depend on the
   context in which social decisions are made. These results provide the
   first detailed investigation of social rGE, and illustrate that that
   genetic variation may influence organismal performance by specifying the
   environment in which traits are expressed.}},

Abstract = {{Inheritance-the influence of ancestors on the phenotypes of their
   descendants-translates natural selection into evolutionary change. For
   the past century, inheritance has been conceptualized almost exclusively
   as the transmission of DNA sequence variation from parents to offspring
   in accordance with Mendelian rules, but advances in cell and
   developmental biology have now revealed a rich array of inheritance
   mechanisms. This empirical evidence calls for a unified conception of
   inheritance that combines genetic and nongenetic mechanisms and
   encompasses the known range of transgenerational effects, including the
   transmission of genetic and epigenetic variation, the transmission of
   plastic phenotypes (acquired traits), and the effects of parental
   environment and genotype on offspring phenotype. We propose a unified
   theoretical framework based on the Price equation that can be used to
   model evolution under an expanded inheritance concept that combines the
   effects of genetic and nongenetic inheritance. To illustrate the utility
   and generality of this framework, we show how it can be applied to a
   variety of scenarios, including nontransmissible environmental noise,
   maternal effects, indirect genetic effects, transgenerational epigenetic
   inheritance, RNA-mediated inheritance, and cultural inheritance.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are commonly observed in both
   plants and animals, and may be partly genetically determined. The social
   effect of an individual does not affect the phenotype of the individual
   itself, but rather the phenotypes of all other individuals sharing the
   environment. As an alternative to traditional breeding schemes solely
   focusing on the direct breeding value affecting the phenotype of the
   individual itself, selection may be focused on total breeding values,
   including both direct and social effects. The latter may give a
   substantial increase in the rate of genetic gain of the population,
   given existence of significant social genetic effects. However, social
   effects are only identifiable when individuals are allocated in several
   groups. Previously, it has been suggested that an optimum design should
   include many small groups consisting of unrelated individuals, e.g., by
   randomly allocating individuals to each group (RAN). However, we
   hypothesize that a design with few (three) families per group (3FAM),
   and where each family is tested repeatedly in three different groups
   would be more advantageous. Using stochastic simulations, assuming a
   full-sib data structure typical for aquaculture breeding schemes, we
   compared the two designs with respect to accuracy of breeding values and
   their ability to produce accurate estimates of (co)variance components
   of direct and social effects. The results showed that the 3FAM design
   was clearly superior with respect to precision of estimated genetic
   (co)variance components of social effects and had substantially higher
   accuracy of both social and total breeding values, compared with the RAN
   design (16 to 105\% increase). The advantage was particularly expressed
   at scenarios with zero or negative genetic correlation between direct
   and social genetic effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   selection when variances in body size were large, but no appreciable

Abstract = {{Inclusive fitness theory has a combination of simplicity, generality,
   and accuracy that has made it an extremely successful way of thinking
   about and modeling effects on kin. However, there are types of social
   interactions that, although covered, are not illuminated. Here, I expand
   the inclusive fitness approach and the corresponding neighbor-modulated
   approach to specify two other kinds of social selection. Kind selection,
   which includes green-beards and many nonadditive games, is where
   selection depends on an actor's trait having different effects on others
   depending on whether they share the trait. Kith selection includes
   social effects that do not require either kin or kind, such as mutualism
   and manipulation. It involves social effects of a trait that affect a
   partner, with feedback to the actor's fitness. I derive expanded
   versions of Hamilton's rule for kith and kind selection, generalizing
   Hamilton's insight that we can model social selection through a sum of
   fitness effects, each multiplied by an appropriate association
   coefficient. Kinship is, thus, only one of the important types of
   association, but all can be incorporated within an expanded inclusive
   fitness.}},

Abstract = {{In many animal species, embryos are exposed to maternal hormones that
   affect their development. Maternal hormone transfer varies with
   environmental conditions of the mother and is often interpreted as being
   shaped by natural selection to adjust the offspring to prevailing
   environmental conditions. Such hormone transfer requires genetic
   variability, which has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. Our
   study reports direct evidence for additive genetic variance of maternal
   androgens through a bidirectional selection on yolk testosterone (T)
   levels in Japanese quail. Lines selected for high egg T (HET) and low
   egg T (LET) concentration differed in yolk levels of this androgen,
   resulting in high realized heritability (h(2) = 0.42). Correlated
   responses to selection on other gonadal hormones indicated that
   selection specifically targeted biologically active androgens. Eggs of
   HET quail contained higher androstenedione and lower estradiol
   concentrations than did those of LET quail, with no line differences in
   yolk progesterone concentration. Plasma T concentrations in adult
   females were not affected by selection, seriously challenging the
   hypothesis that transfer of maternal hormones to offspring is
   constrained by hormone levels in a mother's circulation. Our results
   suggest that transfer of maternal T represents an indirect genetic
   effect that has important consequences for the evolution of traits in
   offspring.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence indicates that grassland community structure and species
   diversity are influenced by genetic variation within species. We review
   what is known regarding the impact of intraspecific diversity on
   grassland community structure, using an ancient limestone pasture as a
   focal example. Two genotype-dependent effects appear to modify community
   structure in this system. First, the abundance of individual constituent
   species can depend upon the combined influence of direct genetic effects
   stemming from individuals within the population. Second, the outcome of
   localized interspecific interactions occurring within the community can
   depend on the genotypes of participating individuals (indicating
   indirect genetic effects). Only genotypic interactions are thought to be
   capable of allowing the long-term coexistence of both genotypes and
   species. We discuss the implications of these effects for the
   maintenance of diversity in grasslands. Next, we present new
   observations indicating that losses of genotypic diversity from each of
   two species can be predicted by the abundance of other coexisting
   species within experimental grassland communities. These results suggest
   genotype-specific responses to abundance in other coexisting species. We
   conclude that both direct and indirect genetic effects are likely to
   shape community structure and species coexistence in grasslands,
   implying tight linkage between fine-scale genetic and community
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{Studying the genetic basis of traits involved in ecological interactions
   is a fundamental part of elucidating the connections between
   evolutionary and ecological processes. Such knowledge allows one to link
   genetic models of trait evolution with ecological models describing
   interactions within and between species. Previous work has shown that
   connections between genetic and ecological processes in Arabidopsis
   thaliana may be mediated by the fact that quantitative trait loci (QTL)
   with `direct' effects on traits of individuals also have pleiotropic
   `indirect' effects on traits expressed in neighbouring plants. Here, we
   further explore these connections by examining functional relationships
   between traits affected directly and indirectly by the same QTL. We
   develop a novel approach using structural equation models (SEMs) to
   determine whether observed pleiotropic effects result from traits
   directly affected by the QTL in focal individuals causing the changes in
   the neighbours' phenotypes. This hypothesis was assessed using SEMs to
   test whether focal plant phenotypes appear to mediate the connection
   between the focal plants' genotypes and the phenotypes of their
   neighbours, or alternatively, whether the connection between the focal
   plants' genotypes and the neighbours' phenotypes is mediated by
   unmeasured traits. We implement this analysis using a QTL of major
   effect that maps to the well-characterized flowering locus, FRIGIDA. The
   SEMs support the hypothesis that the pleiotropic indirect effects of
   this locus arise from size and developmental timing-related traits in
   focal plants affecting the expression of developmental traits in their
   neighbours. Our findings provide empirical insights into the genetics
   and nature of intraspecific ecological interactions. Our technique holds
   promise in directing future work into the genetic basis and functional
   relationship of traits mediating and responding to ecological
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{A metacommunity can be defined as a set of communities that are linked
   by migration, and extinction and recolonization. In metacommunities,
   evolution can occur not only by processes that occur within communities
   such as drift and individual selection, but also by among-community
   processes, such as divergent selection owing to random differences among
   communities in species composition, and group and community-level
   selection. The effect of these among-community-level processes depends
   on the pattern of migration among communities. Migrating units may be
   individuals (migrant pool model), groups of individuals (single-species
   propagule pool model) or multi-species associations (multi-species
   propagule pool model). The most interesting case is the multi-species
   propagule pool model. Although this pattern of migration may a priori
   seem rare, it becomes more plausible in small well-defined `communities'
   such as symbiotic associations between two or a few species. Theoretical
   models and experimental studies show that community selection is
   potentially an effective evolutionary force. Such evolution can occur
   either through genetic changes within species or through changes in the
   species composition of the communities. Although laboratory studies show
   that community selection can be important, little is known about how
   important it is in natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Social niche construction (SNC) occurs when animals actively shape their
   social environments. Currently the fitness consequences of SNC are
   poorly understood, and no study has examined whether variation in SNC
   has a genetic basis. Here we report the first instance of genetic
   variation in SNC by showing that Drosophila male aggression shapes the
   social environment. We allowed flies of different genotypes to interact
   in complex arenas; we measured the number and sex of individuals in the
   groups that formed and counted instances of mating. Arenas containing
   more aggressive male genotypes formed groups with fewer males,
   demonstrating that aggressive male genotypes experienced different
   social environments than nonaggressive genotypes. Further, genotypes
   with highest mating success were those whose SNC behavior generated the
   social environment in which they were most adept at mating: genotypes
   who mate most often after winning aggressive encounters benefit from
   aggressive SNC, while genotypes who mate most often after losing achieve
   high mating rates by forgoing aggression. The presence of these
   alternative strategies-which were robust across eight population
   densities-revealed that selection on aggression and context-dependent
   mating was disruptive, consistent with the hypothesis that SNC can
   maintain genetic variation in multiple behaviors.}},

Title = {{The past, present and future of reproductive skew theory and experiments}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{271-298}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A major evolutionary question is how reproductive sharing arises in
   cooperatively breeding species despite the inherent reproductive
   conflicts in social groups. Reproductive skew theory offers one
   potential solution: each group member gains or is allotted inclusive
   fitness equal to or exceeding their expectation from reproducing on
   their own. Unfortunately, a multitude of skew models with conflicting
   predictions has led to confusion in both testing and evaluating skew
   theory. The confusion arises partly because one set of models (the
   `transactional' type) answer the ultimate evolutionary question of what
   ranges of reproductive skew can yield fitness-enhancing solutions for
   all group members. The second set of models ('compromise') give an
   evolutionarily proximate, game-theoretic evolutionarily stable state
   (ESS) solution that determines reproductive shares based on relative
   competitive abilities. However, several predictions arising from
   compromise models require a linear payoff to increased competition and
   do not hold with non-linear payoffs. Given that for most species it may
   be very difficult or impossible to determine the true relationship
   between effort devoted to competition and reproductive share gained,
   compromise models are much less predictive than previously appreciated.
   Almost all skew models make one quantitative prediction (e.g. realized
   skew must fall within ranges predicted by transactional models), and two
   qualitative predictions (e.g. variation in relatedness or competitive
   ability across groups affects skew). A thorough review of the data finds
   that these three predictions are relatively rarely supported. As a
   general rule, therefore, the evolution of cooperative breeding appears
   not to be dependent on the ability of group members to monitor
   relatedness or competitive ability in order to adjust their behaviour
   dynamically to gain reproductive share. Although reproductive skew
   theory fails to predict within-group dynamics consistently, it does
   better at predicting quantitative differences in skew across populations
   or species. This suggests that kin selection can play a significant role
   in the evolution of sociality. To advance our understanding of
   reproductive skew will require focusing on a broader array of factors,
   such as the frequency of mistaken identity, delayed fitness payoffs, and
   selection pressures arising from across-group competition. We
   furthermore suggest a novel approach to investigate the sharing of
   reproduction that focuses on the underlying genetics of skew. A
   quantitative genetics approach allows the partitioning of variance in
   reproductive share itself or that of traits closely associated with skew
   into genetic and non-genetic sources. Thus, we can determine the
   heritability of reproductive share and infer whether it actually is the
   focus of natural selection. We view the `animal model' as the most
   promising empirical method where the genetics of reproductive share can
   be directly analyzed in wild populations. In the quest to assess whether
   skew theory can provide a framework for understanding the evolution of
   sociality, quantitative genetics will be a central tool in future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{Natural selection operates both directly, via the impact of a trait upon
   the individual's own fitness, and indirectly, via the impact of the
   trait upon the fitness of the individual's genetically related social
   partners. These effects are often framed in terms of Hamilton's rule, rb
   - c > 0, which provides the central result of social-evolution theory.
   However, a number of studies have questioned the generality of
   Hamilton's rule, suggesting that it requires restrictive assumptions.
   Here, we use Fisher's genetical paradigm to demonstrate the generality
   of Hamilton's rule and to clarify links between different studies. We
   show that confusion has arisen owing to researchers misidentifying model
   parameters with the b and c terms in Hamilton's rule, and misidentifying
   measures of genotypic similarity or genealogical relationship with the
   coefficient of genetic relatedness, r. More generally, we emphasize the
   need to distinguish between general kin-selection theory that forms the
   foundations of social evolution, and streamlined kin-selection
   methodology that is used to solve specific problems.}},

Abstract = {{Several experimental results support the existence of costs associated
   with exaggerated begging behaviour, which are assumed by some
   theoretical models of honest signalling in parent-offspring
   communication. However, to understand how honest begging behaviour is
   evolutionarily maintained in nature, the long-term cost-benefit output
   associated with exaggerated signals should also be estimated. As far as
   we know, the net cost-benefit balance of begging display has not
   previously been explored. Here, we used an appetite stimulant,
   cyproheptadine hydrochloride, to increase the feeling of hunger in some
   magpie nestlings. Supporting the use of cyproheptadine to manipulate
   hunger level and thereby begging behaviour, we found that experimental
   nestlings increased the frequency of begging and received more food than
   their control nestmates. Contrary to the expectation that physiological
   costs per se counteract the associated benefits of escalated begging
   signals, we found that near-fledging experimental magpies showed a
   better physical condition than control nestlings. These findings stress
   the interesting question of why magpie nestlings do not show to adults
   an escalated level of hunger if it implies an advantage. We discuss the
   responsibility of inclusive fitness costs and indirect genetic effects
   for the maintenance of honesty in parent-offspring communication.}},

Title = {{Molecular Correlates of Social Dominance: A Novel Role for Ependymin in
   Aggression}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{Theoretical and empirical studies have sought to explain the formation
   and maintenance of social relationships within groups. The resulting
   dominance hierarchies have significant fitness and survival consequences
   dependent upon social status. We hypothesised that each position or rank
   within a group has a distinctive brain gene expression profile that
   correlates with behavioural phenotype. Furthermore, transitions in rank
   position should determine which genes shift in expression concurrent
   with the new dominance status. We used a custom cDNA microarray to
   profile brain transcript expression in a model species, the rainbow
   trout, which forms tractable linear hierarchies. Dominant, subdominant
   and submissive individuals had distinctive transcript profiles with 110
   gene probes identified using conservative statistical analyses. By
   removing the dominant, we characterised the changes in transcript
   expression in sub-dominant individuals that became dominant
   demonstrating that the molecular transition occurred within 48 hours. A
   strong, novel candidate gene, ependymin, which was highly expressed in
   both the transcript and protein in subdominants relative to dominants,
   was tested further. Using antibody injection to inactivate ependymin in
   pairs of dominant and subdominant zebrafish, the subdominant fish
   exhibited a substantial increase in aggression in parallel with an
   enhanced competitive ability. This is the first study to characterise
   the molecular signatures of dominance status within groups and the first
   to implicate ependymin in control of aggressive behaviour. It also
   provides evidence for indirect genetic effect models in which
   genotype/phenotype of an individual is influenced by conspecific
   interactions within a group. The variation in the molecular profile of
   each individual within a group may offer a new explanation of
   intraspecific variation in gene expression within undefined groups of
   animals and provides new candidates for empirical study.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{408-419}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{P>1. There is relatively little information on how evolutionary
   processes that alter genetic variation in a focal species may affect
   interactions with other species, impact the structure or function of the
   community and ecosystem, and affect evolutionary feedbacks among
   interacting species through time.
   2. Because evolution can occur at ecological time-scales, it is
   important to understand how major selective events, such as climatic
   changes, can impact the community of interacting species and ecosystem
   processes by changing intraspecific genetic variation.
   3. The evidence linking genetic variation and evolution to community
   change and feedbacks has arisen from several different approaches whose
   results have not been synthesized into one conceptual framework, and
   whose commonalities may not be fully understood.
   4. This review synthesizes several different experimental approaches on
   how evolution may impact communities and ecosystems and focuses on five
   main issues: (i) the genetic basis to communities and ecosystems; (ii)
   the community and ecosystem consequences of among-population genetic
   differentiation; (iii) the role of local adaptation and co-evolution;
   (iv) the effects of trans-generational feedbacks and the eco-evo dynamic
   and; (v) the integration of community and ecosystem genetics and
   multi-level selection.
   5. Evolution can alter intraspecific genetic variation to affect
   indirect genetic effects and feedbacks. Future studies should
   investigate how communities and ecosystems are affected when evolution
   causes the strength of feedbacks to change.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{By determining access to limited resources, social dominance is often an
   important determinant of fitness. Thus, if heritable, standard theory
   predicts mean dominance should evolve. However, dominance is usually
   inferred from the tendency to win contests, and given one winner and one
   loser in any dyadic contest, the mean proportion won will always equal
   0.5. Here, we argue that the apparent conflict between quantitative
   genetic theory and common sense is resolved by recognition of indirect
   genetic effects (IGEs). We estimate selection on, and genetic
   (co)variance structures for, social dominance, in a wild population of
   red deer Cervus elaphus, on the Scottish island of Rum. While dominance
   is heritable and positively correlated with lifetime fitness, contest
   outcomes depend as much on the genes carried by an opponent as on the
   genotype of a focal individual. We show how this dependency imposes an
   absolute evolutionary constraint on the phenotypic mean, thus
   reconciling theoretical predictions with common sense. More generally,
   we argue that IGEs likely provide a widespread but poorly recognized
   source of evolutionary constraint for traits influenced by competition.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that humans tend to associate with other humans who
   have similar characteristics, but it is unclear whether this tendency
   has consequences for the distribution of genotypes in a population.
   Although geneticists have shown that populations tend to stratify
   genetically, this process results from geographic sorting or assortative
   mating, and it is unknown whether genotypes may be correlated as a
   consequence of nonreproductive associations or other processes. Here, we
   study six available genotypes from the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent Health to test for genetic similarity between friends. Maps
   of the friendship networks show clustering of genotypes and, after we
   apply strict controls for population stratification, the results show
   that one genotype is positively correlated (homophily) and one genotype
   is negatively correlated (heterophily). A replication study in an
   independent sample from the Framingham Heart Study verifies that DRD2
   exhibits significant homophily and that CYP2A6 exhibits significant
   heterophily. These unique results show that homophily and heterophily
   obtain on a genetic (indeed, an allelic) level, which has implications
   for the study of population genetics and social behavior. In particular,
   the results suggest that association tests should include friends' genes
   and that theories of evolution should take into account the fact that
   humans might, in some sense, be metagenomic with respect to the humans
   around them.}},

Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{In social selection the phenotype of an individual depends on its own
   genotype as well as on the phenotypes, and so genotypes, of other
   individuals. This makes it impossible to associate an invariant
   phenotype with a genotype: the social context is crucial. Descriptions
   of metazoan development, which often is viewed as the acme of
   cooperative social behaviour, ignore or downplay this fact. The implicit
   justification for doing so is based on a group-selectionist point of
   view. Namely, embryos are clones, therefore all cells have the same
   evolutionary interest, and the visible differences between cells result
   from a common strategy. The reasoning is flawed, because phenotypic
   heterogeneity within groups can result from contingent choices made by
   cells from a flexible repertoire as in multicellular development. What
   makes that possible is phenotypic plasticity, namely the ability of a
   genotype to exhibit different phenotypes. However, co-operative social
   behaviour with division of labour requires that different phenotypes
   interact appropriately, not that they belong to the same genotype, or
   have overlapping genetic interests. We sketch a possible route to the
   evolution of social groups that involves many steps: (a) individuals
   that happen to be in spatial proximity benefit simply by virtue of their
   number; (b) traits that are already present act as preadaptations and
   improve the efficiency of the group; and (c) new adaptations evolve
   under selection in the social context-that is, via interactions between
   individuals-and further strengthen group behaviour. The Dictyostelid or
   cellular slime mould amoebae (CSMs) become multicellular in an unusual
   way, by the aggregation of free-living cells. In nature the resulting
   group can be genetically homogeneous (clonal) or heterogeneous
   (polyclonal); in either case its development, which displays strong
   cooperation between cells (to the extent of so-called altruism) is not
   affected. This makes the CSMs exemplars for the study of social
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{In this review, I consider the contribution that common evening primrose
   (Oenothera biennis) has made towards integrating the ecology, evolution
   and genetics of species interactions. Oenothera biennis was among the
   earliest plant models in genetics and cytogenetics and it played an
   important role in the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology. More
   recently, population and ecological genetics approaches have provided
   insight into the patterns of genetic variation within and between
   populations, and how a combination of abiotic and biotic factors
   maintain and select on heritable variation within O. biennis
   populations. From an ecological perspective, field experiments show that
   genetic variation and evolution within populations can have cascading
   effects throughout communities. Plant genotype affects the preference
   and performance of individual arthropod populations, as well as the
   composition, biomass, total abundance and diversity of arthropod species
   on plants. A combination of experiments and simulation models show that
   natural selection on specific plant traits can drive rapid ecological
   changes in these same community variables. At the patch level,
   increasing genotypic diversity leads to a greater abundance and
   diversity of omnivorous and predaceous arthropods, which is also
   associated with increased biomass and fecundity of plants in genetically
   diverse patches. Finally, in questioning whether a community genetics
   perspective is needed in biology, I review several multifactorial
   experiments which show that plant genotype often explains as much
   variation in community variables as other ecological factors typically
   identified as most important in ecology. As a whole, research in the O.
   biennis system has contributed to a more complete understanding of the
   dynamic interplay between ecology, evolution and genetics.}},

   versus Group Organization in Dynamic Social Network Models}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 23}},
Abstract = {{Social networks can be used to represent group structure as a network of
   interacting components, and also to quantify both the position of each
   individual and the global properties of a group. In a series of
   simulation experiments based on dynamic social networks, we test the
   prediction that social behaviors that help individuals reach prominence
   within their social group may conflict with their potential to benefit
   from their social environment. In addition to cases where individuals
   were able to benefit from improving both their personal relative
   importance and group organization, using only simple rules of social
   affiliation we were able to obtain results in which individuals would
   face a trade-off between these factors. While selection would favor (or
   work against) social behaviors that concordantly increase (or decrease,
   respectively) fitness at both individual and group level, when these
   factors conflict with each other the eventual selective pressure would
   depend on the relative returns individuals get from their social
   environment and their position within it. The presented results
   highlight the importance of a systems approach to studying animal
   sociality, in which the effects of social behaviors should be viewed not
   only through the benefits that those provide to individuals, but also in
   terms of how they affect broader social environment and how in turn this
   is reflected back on an individual's fitness.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions among individuals are abundant both in natural and
   domestic populations. Such social interactions cause phenotypes of
   individuals to depend on genes carried by other individuals, a
   phenomenon known as indirect genetic effects (IGE). Because IGEs have
   drastic effects on the rate and direction of response to selection,
   knowledge of their magnitude and relationship to direct genetic effects
   (DGE) is indispensable for understanding response to selection. Very
   little is known, however, of statistical power and optimum experimental
   designs for estimating IGEs. This work, therefore, presents expressions
   for the standard errors of the estimated (co)variances of DGEs and IGEs
   and identifies optimum experimental designs for their estimation. It
   also provides an expression for optimum family size and a numerical
   investigation of optimum group size. Designs with groups composed of two
   families were optimal and substantially better than designs with groups
   composed at random with respect to family. Results suggest that IGEs can
   be detected with similar to 1000-2000 individuals and/or similar to
   250-500 groups when using optimum designs. Those values appear feasible
   for agriculture and aquaculture and for the smaller laboratory species.
   In summary, this work provides the tools to optimize and quantify the
   required size of experiments aiming to identify IGEs. An R-package SE.
   IGE is available, which predicts SEs and identifies optimum family and
   group sizes.}},

Abstract = {{Behaviour is typically regarded as among the most flexible of animal
   phenotypic traits. In particular, expression of cooperative behaviour is
   often assumed to be conditional upon the behaviours of others. This
   flexibility is a key component of many hypothesized mechanisms favouring
   the evolution of cooperative behaviour. However, evidence shows that
   cooperative behaviours are often less flexible than expected and that,
   in many species, individuals show consistent differences in the amount
   and type of cooperative and non-cooperative behaviours displayed. This
   phenomenon is known as `animal personality' or a `behavioural syndrome'.
   Animal personality is evolutionarily relevant, as it typically shows
   heritable variation and can entail fitness consequences, and hence, is
   subject to evolutionary change. Here, we review the empirical evidence
   for individual variation in cooperative behaviour across taxa, we
   examine the evolutionary processes that have been invoked to explain the
   existence of individual variation in cooperative behaviour and we
   discuss the consequences of consistent individual differences on the
   evolutionary stability of cooperation. We highlight that consistent
   individual variation in cooperativeness can both stabilize or disrupt
   cooperation in populations. We conclude that recognizing the existence
   of consistent individual differences in cooperativeness is essential for
   an understanding of the evolution and prevalence of cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{An association study between SNP markers and feather condition score on
   the back, rump and belly of laying hens was performed. Feather condition
   score is a measure of feather damage, which has been shown to be closely
   related to feather pecking behaviour in hens housed in groups. A
   population of 662 hens was genotyped for 1536 SNPs of which 1022 could
   be used for the association study. The analysis was conducted across 9
   different lines of White Leghorn and Rhode Island Red origin. Across
   lines linkage disequilibrium is conserved at shorter distances than
   within lines; therefore, SNPs significantly associated with feather
   condition score across lines are expected to be closer to the functional
   mutations. The SNPs that had a significant across-line effect but did
   not show significant SNP-by-line interaction were identified, to test
   that the association was consistent across lines. Both the direct effect
   of the individual's genotype on its plumage condition, and the
   associative effect of the genotype of the cage mates on the individual's
   plumage condition were analysed. The direct genetic effect can be
   considered as the susceptibility to be pecked at, whereas the
   associative genetic effect can be interpreted as the propensity to
   perform feather pecking. Finally, 11 significant associations between
   SNPs and behavioural traits were detected in the direct model, and 81 in
   the associative model. A role of the gene for the serotonin receptor 2C
   (HTR2C) on chromosome 4 was found. This supports existing evidence of a
   prominent involvement of the serotonergic system in the modulation of
   this behavioural disorder in laying hens. The genes for IL9, IL4, CCL4
   and NFKB were found to be associated to plumage condition, revealing
   relationships between the immune system and behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions among conspecifics influence social evolution through two
   distinct but intimately related paths. First, they provide the
   opportunity for indirect genetic effects (IGEs), where genes expressed
   in one individual influence the expression of traits in others. Second,
   interactions can generate social selection when traits expressed in one
   individual influence the fitness of others. Here, we present a
   quantitative genetic model of multivariate trait evolution that
   integrates the effects of both IGEs and social selection, which have
   previously been modeled independently. We show that social selection
   affects evolutionary change whenever the breeding value of one
   individual covaries with the phenotype of its social partners. This
   covariance can be created by both relatedness and IGEs, which are shown
   to have parallel roles in determining evolutionary response. We show
   that social selection is central to the estimation of inclusive fitness
   and derive a version of Hamilton's rule showing the symmetrical effects
   of relatedness and IGEs on the evolution of altruism. We illustrate the
   utility of our approach using altruism, greenbeards, aggression, and
   weapons as examples. Our model provides a general predictive equation
   for the evolution of social phenotypes that encompasses specific cases
   such as kin selection and reciprocity. The parameters can be measured
   empirically, and we emphasize the importance of considering both IGEs
   and social selection, in addition to relatedness, when testing
   hypotheses about social evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions, especially those involving competition among
   individuals, are important in domesticated livestock and in natural
   populations. The heritability of traits affected by such interactions
   has two components, one originating in the individual like that of
   classical traits (direct effects) and the other originating in other
   group members (indirect effects). The latter type of trait represents a
   significant source of `hidden heritability' and it requires population
   structure and knowledge from relatives in order to access it for
   selective breeding. When ignored, competitive interactions may increase
   as an indirect response to direct selection, resulting in diminished
   yields. We illustrate how population genetic structure affects the
   response to selection of traits with indirect genetic effects using
   population genetic and quantitative genetic theory. Population genetic
   theory permits us to connect our results to the existing body of theory
   on kin and group selection in natural populations. The quantitative
   genetic perspective allows us to see how breeders have used knowledge
   from relatives and family selection in the domestication of plants and
   animals to improve the welfare and production of livestock by
   incorporating social genetic effects in the breeding program. We
   illustrate the central features of these models by reviewing empirical
   studies from domesticated chickens.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is heritable
   social variation in ADG from birth until weaning in piglets. Nursing and
   the establishment of teat order are sources of social interaction among
   suckling piglets nursed by the same sow. If a heritable social effect is
   present, but ignored, the selected animals might be the most competitive
   ones with negative effects on growth of their group mates, resulting in
   less response to selection than expected. The social interaction model
   was extended with a maternal component to estimate genetic maternal and
   social effects. Four different animal models were compared: a basic
   model with a direct heritable effect only; a social model accounting for
   direct and social heritable effects; a maternal model with a heritable
   maternal effect in addition to the basic model; and a social-maternal
   model accounting for direct, social, and maternal heritable effects.
   Estimates of direct, maternal, and social heritability were 0.07, 0.06,
   and around 0.0007 (not significantly different from zero, SE = 0.0005),
   respectively. Total heritable variance, including direct, social, and
   maternal heritable variance and their covariances ranged from 0.07 to
   0.15 of the phenotypic variation. Both maternal models were
   significantly better than equivalent nonmaternal models (P <= 0.005).
   The social model was not significantly better than the basic model (P =
   0.102), and the social-maternal model was also not significantly better
   than the maternal model (P = 0.486). There was no evidence for heritable
   social effects among piglets in a group. The generally used maternal
   model fit the data as well as the social-maternal model. Sufficient
   cross-fostering is needed to partition social and maternal variation.}},

Abstract = {{When individuals interact, phenotypic variation can be partitioned into
   direct genetic effects (DGEs) of the individuals' own genotypes,
   indirect genetic effects (IGEs) of their social partners' genotypes and
   epistatic interactions between the genotypes of interacting individuals
   ('genotype-by-genotype (GxG) epistasis'). These components can all play
   important roles in evolutionary processes, but few empirical studies
   have examined their importance. The social amoeba Dictyostelium
   discoideum provides an ideal system to measure these effects during
   social interactions and development. When starved, free-living amoebae
   aggregate and differentiate into a multicellular fruiting body with a
   dead stalk that holds aloft viable spores. By measuring interactions
   among a set of natural strains, we quantify DGEs, IGEs and GxG epistasis
   affecting spore formation. We find that DGEs explain most of the
   phenotypic variance (57.6\%) whereas IGEs explain a smaller (13.3\%) but
   highly significant component. Interestingly, GxG epistasis explains
   nearly a quarter of the variance (23.0\%), highlighting the complex
   nature of genotype interactions. These results demonstrate the large
   impact that social interactions can have on development and suggest that
   social effects should play an important role in developmental evolution
   in this system.}},

Title = {{Genetic parameters for social effects on survival in cannibalistic
   layers: Combining survival analysis and a linear animal model}},
Journal = {{GENETICS SELECTION EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{42}},
Month = {{JUL 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mortality due to cannibalism in laying hens is a difficult
   trait to improve genetically, because censoring is high (animals still
   alive at the end of the testing period) and it may depend on both the
   individual itself and the behaviour of its group members, so-called
   associative effects (social interactions). To analyse survival data,
   survival analysis can be used. However, it is not possible to include
   associative effects in the current software for survival analysis. A
   solution could be to combine survival analysis and a linear animal model
   including associative effects. This paper presents a two-step approach
   (2STEP), combining survival analysis and a linear animal model including
   associative effects (LAM).
   Methods: Data of three purebred White Leghorn layer lines from Institut
   de Selection Animale B. V., a Hendrix Genetics company, were used in
   this study. For the statistical analysis, survival data on 16,780 hens
   kept in fourbird cages with intact beaks were used. Genetic parameters
   for direct and associative effects on survival time were estimated using
   2STEP. Cross validation was used to compare 2STEP with LAM. LAM was
   applied directly to estimate genetic parameters for social effects on
   observed survival days.
   Results: Using 2STEP, total heritable variance, including both direct
   and associative genetic effects, expressed as the proportion of
   phenotypic variance, ranged from 32\% to 64\%. These results were
   substantially larger than when using LAM. However, cross validation
   showed that 2STEP gave approximately the same survival curves and rank
   correlations as LAM. Furthermore, cross validation showed that selection
   based on both direct and associative genetic effects, using either 2STEP
   or LAM, gave the best prediction of survival time.
   Conclusion: It can be concluded that 2STEP can be used to estimate
   genetic parameters for direct and associative effects on survival time
   in laying hens. Using 2STEP increased the heritable variance in survival
   time. Cross validation showed that social genetic effects contribute to
   a large difference in survival days between two extreme groups. Genetic
   selection targeting both direct and associative effects is expected to
   reduce mortality due to cannibalism in laying hens.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of experimental sexual selection have tested the effect of
   variation in the intensity of sexual selection on male investment in
   reproduction, particularly sperm. However, in several species, including
   Drosophila pseudoobscura, no sperm response to experimental evolution
   has occurred. Here, we take a quantitative genetics approach to examine
   whether genetic constraints explain the limited evolutionary response.
   We quantified direct and indirect genetic variation, and genetic
   correlations within and between the sexes, in experimental populations
   of D. pseudoobscura. We found that sperm number may be limited by low
   heritability and evolvability whereas sperm quality (length) has
   moderate V(A) and CV(A) but does not evolve. Likewise, the female
   reproductive tract, suggested to drive the evolution of sperm, did not
   respond to experimental sexual selection even though there was
   sufficient genetic variation. The lack of genetic correlations between
   the sexes supports the opportunity for sexual conflict over investment
   in sperm by males and their storage by females. Our results suggest no
   absolute constraint arising from a lack of direct or indirect genetic
   variation or patterns of genetic covariation. These patterns show why
   responses to experimental evolution are hard to predict, and why
   research on genetic variation underlying interacting reproductive traits
   is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetics effects (IGEs)-when the genotype of one individual
   affects the phenotypic expression of a trait in another-may alter
   evolutionary trajectories beyond that predicted by standard quantitative
   genetic theory as a consequence of genotypic evolution of the social
   environment. For IGEs to occur, the trait of interest must respond to
   one or more indicator traits in interacting conspecifics. In
   quantitative genetic models of IGEs, these responses (reaction norms)
   are termed interaction effect coefficients and are represented by the
   parameter psi (Psi). The extent to which Psi exhibits genetic variation
   within a population, and may therefore itself evolve, is unknown. Using
   an experimental evolution approach, we provide evidence for a genetic
   basis to the phenotypic response caused by IGEs on sexual display traits
   in Drosophila serrata. We show that evolution of the response is
   affected by sexual but not natural selection when flies adapt to a novel
   environment. Our results indicate a further mechanism by which IGEs can
   alter evolutionary trajectories-the evolution of interaction effects
   themselves.}},

Abstract = {{Female reproductive performance can be strongly affected by male care,
   so that breeding time, a trait expressed only by females, can be seen as
   one trait determined by both male and female genotypes. Animal model
   analyses of a 46-year study of red-billed gulls (Larus novaehollandiae
   scopulinus) revealed that laying date was not heritable in females (h2 =
   0.001 +/- 0.030), but significantly so in males (h2 = 0.134 +/- 0.029).
   Heritability of breeding time in males probably reflects genetic
   variability in some other trait such as courtship feeding ability. In
   line with predictions of evolutionary models incorporating indirect
   genetic effects, the strong and consistent directional selection for
   advanced breeding time has not resulted in detectable selection response
   in males. Our results demonstrate that a female trait is largely
   determined by genetic characteristics of its mate, and hence, any
   evolutionary change in red-billed gull breeding time depends critically
   on genetic variation in males.}},

Abstract = {{P>Social genetic relationships among average daily gain (ADG, g) and
   feeding pattern as daily feed intake (DFI, g), daily feeder occupation
   time (DOT, min), and daily feeding rate (DFR, g/min) were examined using
   records of 547 Duroc boars. Single-trait animal models were fitted
   differently for traits, including or excluding social genetic effects,
   random or fixed pen effects, with covariates of pen sizes and initial
   age or weight. Genetic parameters for feeding pattern were estimated by
   restricted maximum likelihood. Six sets of parameters for ADG based on
   literature estimates were used due to difficulty in untangling
   confounded effects. Positive and negative signs of direct-social genetic
   covariances were interpreted as heritable cooperation and competition,
   respectively. Dominant and subordinate pigs were classified as pigs with
   higher direct and social genetic values, respectively. Correlations of
   estimated breeding values between ADG and DFI, DOT, and DFR were 0.46,
   0.04 and 0.29 for dominant pigs. Given heritable cooperation,
   subordinate pigs tended to increase feed intake (r = 0.36) and eating
   rate (r = 0.25). Given heritable competition, subordinate pigs fail to
   compensate for the competition with decreased feed intake (r = -0.53).
   The slow eating rate (r = -0.31) was considered as a consequence of
   eating during less busy hour of feeding.}},

Title = {{Antagonistic Parent-Offspring Co-Adaptation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: In species across taxa, offspring have means to influence
   parental investment (PI). PI thus evolves as an interacting phenotype
   and indirect genetic effects may strongly affect the co-evolutionary
   dynamics of offspring and parental behaviors. Evolutionary theory
   focused on explaining how exaggerated offspring solicitation can be
   understood as resolution of parent-offspring conflict, but the
   evolutionary origin and diversification of different forms of family
   interactions remains unclear.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In contrast to previous theory that
   largely uses a static approach to predict how ``offspring individuals''
   and ``parental individuals'' should interact given conflict over PI, we
   present a dynamic theoretical framework of antagonistic selection on the
   PI individuals obtain/take as offspring and the PI they provide as
   parents to maximize individual lifetime reproductive success; we analyze
   a deterministic and a stochastic version of this dynamic framework. We
   show that a zone for equivalent co-adaptation outcomes exists in which
   stable levels of PI can evolve and be maintained despite fast strategy
   transitions and ongoing co-evolutionary dynamics. Under antagonistic
   co-adaptation, cost-free solicitation can evolve as an adaptation to
   emerging preferences in parents.
   Conclusions/Significance: We show that antagonistic selection across the
   offspring and parental life-stage of individuals favors co-adapted
   offspring and parental behavior within a zone of equivalent outcomes.
   This antagonistic parent-offspring co-adaptation does not require
   solicitation to be costly, allows for rapid divergence and evolutionary
   novelty and potentially explains the origin and diversification of the
   observed provisioning forms in family life.}},

Abstract = {{Competition and cooperation is fundamental to evolution by natural
   selection, both in animals and plants. Here, I investigate the
   consequences of such interactions for response in fitness due to natural
   selection. I provide quantitative genetic expressions for heritable
   variance and response in fitness due to natural selection when
   conspecifics interact. Results show that interactions among conspecifics
   generate extra heritable variance in fitness, and that interacting with
   kin is the key to evolutionary success because it translates the extra
   heritable variance into response in fitness. This work also unifies
   Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection (FTNS) and Hamilton's
   inclusive fitness (IF). The FTNS implies that natural selection
   maximizes fitness, whereas Hamilton proposed maximization of IF. This
   work shows that the FTNS describes the increase in IF, rather than
   direct fitness, at a rate equal to the additive genetic variance in
   fitness. Thus, Hamilton's IF and Fisher's FTNS both describe the
   maximization of IF.}},

Abstract = {{Increased female reproductive rates usually result in accelerated
   senescence. This correlation provides a link between the evolutionary
   conflict of the sexes and aging when ejaculate components elevate female
   reproductive rates at the cost of future reproduction. It is not clear
   whether this female cost is manifest as shorter lifespan or an earlier
   onset or a steeper rate of reproductive senescence. It also is unclear
   whether beneficial ejaculates release females from reproductive
   trade-offs and, if so, which senescence parameters are affected. We
   examined these issues in the bedbug, Cimex lectularius, a long-lived
   insect that shows reduced female lifespan as well as female reproductive
   senescence at the male-determined mating frequency. We demonstrate
   experimentally that, independently of the mating frequency, females
   receiving more ejaculate show increased reproductive rates and enter
   reproductive senescence later than females receiving less ejaculate. The
   rate of reproductive senescence did not differ between treatments, and
   reproductive rates did not predict mortality. The ejaculate effects were
   consistent in inter-and intra-population crosses, suggesting they have
   not evolved recently and are not caused by inbreeding. Our results
   suggest that ejaculate components compensate for the costs of elevated
   female reproductive rates in bedbugs by delaying the onset of
   reproductive senescence. Ejaculate components that are beneficial to
   polyandrous females could have arisen because male traits that protect
   the ejaculate have positive pleiotropic effects and/or because female
   counter-adaptations to antagonistic male traits exceed the
   neutralization of those traits. That males influence female reproductive
   senescence has important consequences for trade-offs between
   reproduction and longevity and for studies of somatic senescence.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the nature of selection against deleterious alleles is
   central to determining how populations are affected by the constant
   influx of new mutations. Important progress has been made in estimating
   basic attributes of the distribution of selection coefficients and gene
   interaction effects (epistasis). Although most aspects of selection are
   likely to be context dependent, little is known about the effect of
   stress on selection and epistasis at the level of individual genes,
   especially in multicellular organisms. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we
   measure how selection on 20 mutant alleles is affected by direct and
   indirect genetic factors across two environments. We find that
   environmental stress increases selection against individual mutations
   but reduces selection against combinations of mutations (i.e., epistasis
   becomes more positive). In addition, we find a high incidence of
   indirect genetic effects whereby the strength of selection against the
   alleles carried by offspring is dependent on the genotypes of their
   parents.}},

Abstract = {{Despite a massive research effort, our understanding of the evolution of
   female mate choice remains incomplete {[}1, 2]. A central problem is
   that the predominating empirical research tradition has focused on male
   traits, yet the key question is whether female choice traits are
   maintained because of direct effects on female fitness or because of
   indirect genetic effects in offspring that may be associated with such
   traits. Here, we address this question by using a novel research
   strategy that employs experimental phenotypic manipulation of a female
   choice trait in an insect model system, the seed beetle Callosobruchus
   chinensis (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). We show that females with increased
   efficiency of choice enjoy strongly elevated fitness compared to females
   with reduced choice efficiency. In contrast, we found no effects of
   female choice efficiency on offspring fitness. Our results show that
   female choice is maintained by direct selection in females in this
   system, whereas indirect selection is relatively weak at most. We
   suggest that phenotypic engineering of female choice traits can greatly
   advance our ability to elucidate the relative importance of direct and
   indirect selection for the maintenance of female choice.}},

Abstract = {{Social environments are inherently dynamic, often changing depending on
   the frequency and outcomes of conspecific interactions - they can be
   simultaneously the targets and agents of selection. Understanding how
   organisms settle in heterogeneous social environments and the effects
   this has on reproductive success is vital to our understanding of the
   selective forces at work in wild populations. From an intensive
   behavioural and ecological study of territoriality in the polymorphic
   white-throated sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis), we demonstrate that
   males of the two morphs inhabit social niches that correspond to their
   respective alternative reproductive strategies. By integrating molecular
   ecology and Geographic Information Systems, we generated continuous,
   socio-spatial models of local conspecific density and cuckoldry risk.
   Our results suggest that the morphs segregate their territories based on
   socio-spatial variables, creating a heterogeneous social landscape that
   matches each behavioural phenotype with a favourable social environment.
   Specifically, the monogamous tan males tended to settle in low-density
   areas that were also low for cuckoldry risk, while the opposite was true
   for the promiscuous white males. This pattern of socio-spatial
   heterogeneity, combined with the social niche partitioning we observed,
   might act as a social niche polymorphism, and play an important role in
   maintenance of the alternative reproductive strategies of the
   white-throated sparrow. Socio-spatial factors, similar to those observed
   in the white-throated sparrow, may play important roles in the evolution
   of mating systems in other species, even those with more continuous or
   cryptic variation.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years much progress has been made towards understanding the
   selective forces involved in the evolution of social behaviour including
   conflicts over reproduction among group members. Here, I argue that an
   important additional step necessary for advancing our understanding of
   the resolution of potential conflicts within insect societies is to
   consider the genetics of the behaviours involved. First, I discuss how
   epigenetic modifications of behaviour may affect conflict resolution
   within groups. Second, I review known natural polymorphisms of social
   organization to demonstrate that a lack of consideration of the genetic
   mechanisms involved may lead to erroneous explanations of the adaptive
   significance of behaviour. Third, I suggest that, on the basis of recent
   genetic studies of sexual conflict in Drosophila, it is necessary to
   reconsider the possibility of within-group manipulation by means of
   chemical substances (i.e. pheromones). Fourth, I address the issue of
   direct versus indirect genetic effects, which is of particular
   importance for the study of behaviour in social groups. Fifth, I discuss
   the issue of how a genetic influence on dominance hierarchies and
   reproductive division of labour can have secondary effects, for example
   in the evolution of promiscuity. Finally, because the same sets of genes
   (e. g. those implicated in chemical signalling and the responses that
   are triggered) may be used even in species as divergent as ants,
   cooperative breeding birds and primates, an integration of genetic
   mechanisms into the field of social evolution may also provide unifying
   ideas.}},

Abstract = {{The solicitation behaviours performed by dependent young are under
   selection from the environment created by their parents, as well as
   wider ecological conditions. Here we show how mechanisms acting before
   hatching enable canary offspring to adapt their begging behaviour to a
   variable post-hatching world. Cross-fostering experiments revealed that
   canary nestling begging intensity is positively correlated with the
   provisioning level of their own parents (to foster chicks). When we
   experimentally increased food quality before and during egg laying,
   mothers showed higher faecal androgen levels and so did their nestlings,
   even when they were cross-fostered before hatching to be reared by
   foster mothers that had been exposed to a standard regime of food
   quality. Higher parental androgen levels were correlated with greater
   levels of post-hatching parental provisioning and (we have previously
   shown) increased faecal androgens in chicks were associated with greater
   begging intensity. We conclude that androgens mediate environmentally
   induced plasticity in the expression of both parental and offspring
   traits, which remain correlated as a result of prenatal effects,
   probably acting within the egg. Offspring can thus adapt their begging
   intensity to variable family and ecological environments.}},

Abstract = {{Timing of flowering is central to reproductive success and is currently
   advancing in many natural populations due to a warmer climate. However,
   we have little understanding of how earlier initiation of flowering
   influences subsequent reproductive phenology or the expression of traits
   in the offspring. To evaluate the consequences of an altered flowering
   phenology we manipulated cohorts of Campanulastrum americanum, an herb
   with annual and biennial growth forms, to flower and disperse seeds up
   to a month earlier, at the same time, and up to a month later than a
   natural population in two separate years. Relative to the date of first
   flower, the temporal patterns of flower production and the timing of
   fruit maturation and seed dispersal were similar among individuals that
   initiated flowering over the expanded reproductive season, indicating
   strong phenological integration of reproductive traits. However, plants
   that initiated flowering substantially outside the natural window showed
   a change in the rate of reproduction, with a compressed reproductive
   schedule for early-flowering individuals and an expanded one for
   late-flowering plants. Changes in flowering time had more dramatic
   effects on the offspring generation. Initiation of flowering two weeks
   earlier would result in a fourfold increase in the frequency of annual
   offspring, and four weeks earlier would result in a tenfold increase.
   The frequency of annuals was less sensitive to modest delays in
   flowering time but decreased with greater delays in flowering time.
   Collectively, these results reveal a tightly integrated reproductive
   phenology that shifts with timing of flowering within generations but
   may lead to more dramatic responses to climate change between
   generations.}},

Abstract = {{The equilibrium sequence diversity of genes within a population and the
   rate of sequence divergence between populations or species depends on a
   variety of factors, including expression pattern, mutation rate, nature
   of selection, random drift, and mating system. Here, we extend
   population genetic theory developed for maternal-effect genes to predict
   the equilibrium polymorphism within species and sequence divergence
   among species for genes with social effects on fitness. We show how the
   fitness effects of genes, mating system, and genetic system affect
   predicted gene polymorphism. We find that, because genes with indirect
   social effects on fitness effectively experience weaker selection, they
   are expected to harbor higher levels of polymorphism relative to genes
   with direct fitness effects. The relative increase in polymorphism is
   proportional to the inverse of the genetic relatedness between
   individuals expressing the gene and their social partners that
   experience the fitness effects of the gene. We find a similar pattern of
   more rapid divergence between populations or species for genes with
   indirect social effects relative to genes with direct effects. We focus
   our discussion on the social insects, organisms with diverse indirect
   genetic effects, mating and genetic systems, and we suggest specific
   examples for testing our predictions with emerging sociogenomic tools.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which occur when phenotypic expression
   in one individual is influenced by genes in another conspecific
   individual, may have a drastic effect on evolutionary response to
   selection. General evolutionary models of IGEs have been developed using
   two distinct theoretical frameworks derived from maternal effects
   theory. The first framework is trait-based and focuses on how phenotypes
   are influenced by specific traits in a social partner, with the strength
   of interactions defined by the matrix Psi. The second framework
   partitions total genetic variance into components representing direct
   effects, indirect effects, and the covariance between them, without
   identifying specific social traits responsible for IGEs. The latter
   framework has been employed more commonly by empiricists because the
   methods for estimating variance components are relatively
   straightforward. Here, we show how these two theoretical frameworks are
   related to each other and derive equations that can be used to translate
   between them. This translation leads to a generalized method that can be
   used to estimate Psi via standard quantitative genetic breeding designs
   or pedigrees from natural populations. This method can be used in a very
   general set of circumstances and is widely applicable to all IGEs,
   including maternal effects and other interactions among relatives.}},

Abstract = {{How and why cooperation evolves, particularly among nonrelatives,
   remains a major paradox for evolutionary biologists and behavioral
   ecologists. Although much attention has focused on fitness consequences
   associated with cooperating, relatively little is known about the second
   component of evolutionary change, the inheritance of cooperation or
   reciprocity. The genetics of behaviors that can only be expressed in the
   context of interactions are particularly difficult to describe because
   the relevant genes reside in multiple social partners. Indirect genetic
   effects (IGEs) describe the influence of genes carried in social
   partners on the phenotype of a focal individual and thus provide a novel
   approach to quantifying the genetics underlying interactions such as
   reciprocal cooperation. We used inbred lines of guppies and a novel
   application of IGE theory to describe the dual genetic control of
   predator inspection and social behavior, both classic models of
   reciprocity. We identified effects of focal strain, social group strain,
   and interactions between focal and group strains on variation in focal
   behavior. We measured., the coefficient of the interaction, which
   describes the degree to which an individual's phenotype is influenced by
   the phenotype of its social partners. The genetic identity of social
   partners substantially influences inspection behavior, measures of
   threat assessment, and schooling and does so in positively reinforcing
   manner. We therefore demonstrate strong IGEs for antipredator behavior
   that represent the genetic variation necessary for the evolution of
   reciprocity.}},

Abstract = {{In genetic association studies, different complex phenotypes are often
   associated with the same marker. Such associations can be indicative of
   pleiotropy (i.e. common genetic causes), of indirect genetic effects via
   one of these phenotypes, or can be solely attributable to
   non-genetic/environmental links between the traits. To identify the
   phenotypes with the inducing genetic association, statistical
   methodology is needed that is able to distinguish between the different
   causes of the genetic associations. Here, we propose a simple, general
   adjustment principle that can be incorporated into many standard genetic
   association tests which are then able to infer whether an SNP has a
   direct biological influence on a given trait other than through the
   SNP's influence on another correlated phenotype. Using simulation
   studies, we show that, in the presence of a non-marker related link
   between phenotypes, standard association tests without the proposed
   adjustment can be biased. In contrast to that, the proposed methodology
   remains unbiased. Its achieved power levels are identical to those of
   standard adjustment methods, making the adjustment principle universally
   applicable in genetic association studies. The principle is illustrated
   by an application to three genome-wide association analyses. Genet.

Abstract = {{Charles Darwin laid the foundation for all modern work on sexual
   selection in his seminal book The Descent of Man, and Selection in
   Relation to Sex. In this work, Darwin fleshed out the mechanism of
   sexual selection, a hypothesis that he had proposed in The Origin of
   Species. He went well beyond a simple description of the phenomenon by
   providing extensive evidence and considering the far-reaching
   implications of the idea. Here we consider the contributions of Darwin
   to sexual selection with a particular eye on how far we have progressed
   in the last 150 years. We focus on 2 key questions in sexual selection.
   First, why does mate choice evolve at all? And second, what factors
   determine the strength of mate choice (or intensity of sexual selection)
   in each sex? Darwin provided partial answers to these questions, and the
   progress that has been made on both of these topics since his time
   should be seen as one of the great triumphs of modern evolutionary
   biology. However, a review of the literature shows that key aspects of
   sexual selection are still plagued by confusion and disagreement. Many
   of these areas are complex and will require new theory and empirical
   data for complete resolution. Overall, Darwin's contributions are still
   surprisingly relevant to the modern study of sexual selection, so
   students of evolutionary biology would be well advised to revisit his
   works. Although we have made significant progress in some areas of
   sexual selection research, we still have much to accomplish.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic variation in female resistance and tolerance to male mating
   harassment can affect the outcome of sexually antagonistic mating
   interactions. We investigated female mating rates and male mating
   harassment in natural populations of a damselfly (Ischnura elegans).
   This damselfly species has a heritable sex-limited polymorphism in
   females, where one of the morphs is a male mimic (androchrome females).
   The three female morphs differ in mating rates, and these differences
   are stable across populations and years. However, the degree of
   premating resistance toward male mating attempts varied across
   generations and populations. Male mating harassment of the female morphs
   changed in a density-dependent fashion, suggesting that male mate
   preferences are plastic and vary with the different morph densities. We
   quantified morph differences in male mating harassment and female
   fecundity, using path analysis and structural equation modeling. We
   found variation between the morphs in the fitness consequences of
   mating, with the fecundity of one of the nonmimetic morphs declining
   with increasing male mating harassment. However, androchrome females had
   lower overall fecundity, presumably reflecting a cost of male mimicry.
   Density-dependent male mating harassment on the morphs and fecundity
   costs of male mimicry are thus likely to contribute to the maintenance
   of this female polymorphism.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1427-1434}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Theory for the evolution of social interactions based on continuous
   strategies often assumes for simplicity that expressed behaviours are
   independent of previous encounters. In reality, however, such
   dependencies are likely to be widespread and often strong, generating
   complex behavioural dynamics. To model this process and illustrate
   potential consequences for the evolution of behavioural interactions, we
   consider the behavioural dynamics of the interaction between caring
   parents and their demanding offspring, a prime example of long series of
   interdependent and highly dynamic interactions. These dynamics can be
   modelled using functions describing mechanisms for how parents and their
   offspring respond to each other in the interaction. We establish the
   general conditions under which the behavioural dynamics converge towards
   a proximate equilibrium and refer to such converging interactions as
   behaviourally stable strategies (BSSs). We further demonstrate that
   there is scope for behavioural instability under realistic conditions;
   that is, whenever parents and/or offspring `overreact' beyond some
   threshold. By applying the derived condition for behavioural stability
   to evolutionary models of parent-offspring conflict resolution, we show
   by numerical simulations that evolutionarily stable strategies (ESSs) of
   current models are not necessarily behaviourally stable. Because
   behavioural instability implies that expressed levels of behaviours
   deviate from the ESS, behavioural stability is required for strict
   evolutionary stability in repeated behavioural interactions. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that maintain genetic
   variation in natural populations is one of the fundamental goals of
   evolutionary biology. There is growing evidence that
   genotype-by-environment interaction (G x E) can maintain additive
   genetic variance (V (A)), but we lack information on the relative
   performance of genotypes under the competitive situations encountered in
   the field. Competing genotypes may influence each other, and this
   interaction is also subject to selection through indirect genetic
   effects (IGE). Here, we explore how genotypes perform when interacting
   and evaluate IGE in order to understand its influence on V (A) for
   sexually-selected traits in the lesser waxmoth, Achroia grisella. We
   found that inter-genotype differences and crossover interactions under
   joint rearing are equal to or greater than values when reared
   separately. A focal genotype exhibited different performances when
   jointly reared with various genotypes-suggesting that IGE may be
   responsible for the increased levels of crossover and differences in
   performance observed. We suggest that some genotypes are superior
   competitors for food acquisition in the larval stage, and that these
   differences influence the development and evolution of other genotypes
   through IGE. We reaffirm the role of G x E in maintaining V (A) and note
   the general importance of IGE in studies of evolutionary mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Reproductive investment decisions form an integral part of life-history
   biology. Selection frequently favours plasticity in investment that can
   generate maternal effects on offspring development. For example, if
   females differentially allocate resources based on mate attractiveness
   or quality, this can create a non-genetic link between mate
   attractiveness and offspring fitness with potential consequences for
   ecological and evolutionary dynamics. It is therefore important to
   understand under what conditions differential investment into offspring
   in relation to male quality is expected to occur and the direction of
   the effect. Two opposite predictions, increased investment into
   offspring produced with high-quality mates ( differential allocation
   (DA)) and increased investment with low-quality males ( reproductive
   compensation ( RC)) have been suggested but no formal theoretical
   treatment justifying the assumptions underlying these two hypotheses has
   been conducted to date. Here, we used a state-based approach to
   investigate the circumstances under which the variation in mate quality
   results in differential female investment into offspring and how this
   interacts with female energetic resource levels. We found that a pattern
   of increased investment when mating with high-quality mates (i.e. DA)
   was the most common optimal investment strategy for females in our
   model. By contrast, increased investment when mating with low-quality
   mates (i.e. RC) was predicted only when the relative impact of parental
   investment on offspring quality was low. Finally, we found that the
   specific pattern of investment in relation to male quality depends on
   female energetic state, the likelihood for future mating opportunities
   and the expected future distribution of mate quality. Thus, the female's
   age and body condition should be important factors mediating DA and RC,
   which may help to explain the equivocal results of empirical studies.}},

Abstract = {{There is mounting evidence in a variety of taxa that females increase
   offspring quality by mating with multiple males, often resulting in
   multiple paternity. In birds, however, few studies have explicitly
   examined the benefits of mating with several different males; instead,
   the focus has been on whether or not extra-pair mating occurs, and its
   adaptive significance remains controversial. We examined the hypothesis
   that offspring quality, particularly immune response
   (phytohaemagglutinin assay) and growth, increases with the number of
   sires in broods of socially monogamous tree swallows (Tachycineta
   bicolor). We found one of the highest known levels of multiple paternity
   in birds (84\% of nests with two or more extra-pair young had at least
   two extra-pair sires). Among nests with extra-pair young, the number and
   diversity of sires continued to increase linearly with the number of
   extra-pair young, so there was no evidence that some males monopolized
   paternity at high levels of extra-pair fertilization. Indeed, the number
   of sires was actually greater than expected in large broods, suggesting
   that some females might be seeking more mates. We found no effect of the
   number of sires on nestling immune response or growth. In mixed
   paternity broods, the immune response of extra-pair young did not differ
   from that of their within-pair half-siblings. However, among all broods,
   nestlings had a stronger immune response in nests with at least one
   extra-pair nestling than in nests with all within-pair nestlings. These
   results are not consistent with a good genes benefit of extra-pair
   mating, but they do suggest that there are environmental effects
   associated with extra-pair mating that increase nestling immune
   response. These environmental effects could produce indirect genetic
   effects on sexual selection if they are heritable. The extraordinarily
   high number of sires in this species highlights a relatively unexplored
   source of sexual selection in birds.}},

Abstract = {{Sperm competition is a pervasive force. One adaptation is the male
   ability to displace the rivals' sperm that females have stored from
   previous copulations. In the damselfly, Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis
   asturica, males with wider aedeagi displace more spermathecal sperm. The
   present study documents that the same mechanism operates in another
   damselfly, Hetaerina americana. However, this genital width in both
   species decreases along the season, but late-emerging females have more
   sperm displaced than early-emerging females. Because territorial males
   mated more and were larger in body and genital size than nonterritorial
   males, late-season females mated with considerably larger males with
   respect to female size and this produced higher sperm displacement.
   Assuming female benefits from storing sperm but that such benefit does
   not prevail if males displace sperm, it is predicted that, along the
   season, females will mate less and male harassment (in terms of male
   mating attempts and oviposition duration) will increase. These
   predictions were corroborated. In H. americana, it was also tested
   whether spermathecal sperm became less viable along the season. The
   results obtained did not corroborate this. This is the first evidence
   indicating that season affects sperm displacement ability and female
   mating frequency due to changes in male body and genital size. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{Social interactions pervade all aspects of life in the social insects.
   Networks of interacting nestmates enable the maintenance of colony
   homeostasis and regulation of brood development. Artificial colony-level
   selection on the amount of pollen stored in honeybee colonies has
   produced high- and low-pollen-hoarding strains that have been used as a
   model system to study the genetic and physiological basis of differences
   in forager behavior that contribute to colony-level differences in
   pollen hoarding. Here we extend this model system using an
   interacting-phenotypes approach that explicitly studies genetic
   components arising from social interactions. High- and
   low-pollen-hoarding-strain larvae were reared in hives with high- or
   low-strain older larvae and high- or low-strain adult workers. The
   ovariole number and dry mass of focal individuals depended on
   interactions between the genotypes of the focal individuals and their
   brood and adult worker nestmates. These results show that trait
   expression by individual honeybee workers is modulated by the genotypic
   composition of the colony, indicating that individual-level phenotypes
   are properties of the composite ``sociogenome.{''} Thus, colony-level
   selection has produced strains with distinct combinations of socially
   interacting genes, which make up the social networks that regulate
   development and expressed phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Aggressive behaviours are necessarily expressed in a social context,
   such that individuals may be influenced by the phenotypes, and
   potentially the genotypes, of their social partners. Consequently, it
   has been hypothesized that indirect genetic effects (IGEs) arising from
   the social environment will provide a major source of heritable
   variation on which selection can act. However, there has been little
   empirical scrutiny of this to date. Here we test this hypothesis in an
   experimental population of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). Using
   quantitative genetic models of five aggression traits, we find
   repeatable and heritable differences in agonistic behaviours of focal
   individuals when presented with an opponent mouse. For three of the
   traits, there is also support for the presence of IGEs, and estimated
   correlations between direct and indirect genetic (rA(O,F)) effects were
   high. As a consequence, any selection for aggression in the focal
   individuals should cause evolution of the social environment as a
   correlated response. In two traits, strong positive rA(O,F) will cause
   the rapid evolution of aggression, while in a third case changes in the
   phenotypic mean will be constrained by negative covariance between
   direct and IGEs. Our results illustrate how classical analyses may miss
   important components of heritable variation, and show that a full
   understanding of evolutionary dynamics requires explicit consideration
   of the genetic component of the social environment.}},

Abstract = {{P>Maternal effects are ubiquitous in nature. In plants, most work has
   focused on the effects of maternal environments on offspring trait
   expression. Less is known about the prevalence of genetic maternal
   effects and how they influence adaptive evolution. Here, we used
   multivariate genetic models to estimate the contributions of maternal
   and direct genetic (co)variance, the cross-generation direct-maternal
   covariance, and M, the matrix of maternal effect coefficients, for
   life-history traits in Campanulastrum americanum, a monocarpic herb.
   Following a three-generation breeding design, we grew paternal half-sib
   families with full-sib relatives of each parent and measured juvenile
   and adult traits.
   Seed size was influenced exclusively by maternal environmental effects,
   whereas maternal genetic effects influenced traits throughout the life
   cycle, including strong direct and maternal additive genetic
   correlations within and between generations for phenological and size
   traits. Examination of M suggested that both juvenile and adult traits
   in maternal plants influenced the expression of offspring traits.
   This study reveals substantial potential for genetic maternal effects to
   contribute to adaptive evolution including cross-generation
   direct-maternal correlations that may slow selection response, maternal
   effects on phenology that reinforce genetic correlations, and within-
   and between-generation genetic correlations that may influence
   life-history polymorphism.

Abstract = {{Chemical communication mediates social interactions in insects {[}1].
   For the fruit fly, D. melanogaster, the chemical display is a key
   fitness trait because it leads to mating. An exchange of cues that
   resembles a dialogue between males and females is enacted by pheromones,
   chemical signals that pass between individual flies to alter physiology
   and behavior {[}2, 3]. Chemical signals also affect the timing of
   locomotor activity {[}4] and sleep {[}5]. We investigated genetic and
   environmental determinants of chemical communication. To evaluate the
   role of the social environment, we extracted a chemical blend from
   individual males selected from groups composed of one genotype and
   compared these extracts to those from groups of mixed genotypes. To
   evaluate the role of the physical environment, these comparisons were
   performed under a light-dark cycle or in constant darkness. Here, we
   show that chemical signaling is affected by the social environment,
   light-dark cycle, and genotype as well as the complex interplay of these
   variables. Gene-by-environment interactions produce highly significant
   effects on chemical signaling. We also examined individual responses
   within the groups. Strikingly, the response of one wild-type fly to
   another is modulated by the genotypic composition of his neighbors.
   Chemical signaling in D. melanogaster may be a ``fickle{''} trait that
   depends on the individual's social background.}},

   debate regarding potential confounding factors but no consensus appears
   to have been reached. Here we focus on the implicit assumption that all
   individuals face the same selective pressures and argue that this
   assumption is probably too strong in most cases. Using a theoretical
   model we show that when the amount of resources that a male provides
   depends on territory quality, his physical condition or prospects for
   alternative breeding opportunities, a female may respond to such
   differences by altering her mating behaviour. Such confounding factors
   may lead to direct fitness effects that result in negative correlations
   between paternal care and paternity even if females that produce
   extra-pair young experience a net benefit. Negative correlations can
   also result when males forcefully seek copulations and females resist
   them. We discuss the studies included in the analysis in this light, and
   conclude that current analyses on the net selective pressures remain
   uninformative. In addition to considering average effects across
   individuals and species we suggest giving attention to individual
   differences and the influence of ecological factors such as territory
   quality and predation pressures on female mating behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental conditions experienced by a female prior to reproducing
   may be influenced by her mate. Part of such an indirect effect of a male
   on his partner's reproduction may be genetic (indirect genetic effect).
   However, a female's direct and a male's indirect genetic effects need
   not align. We analyzed 10,652 records of seasonal timing of laying, an
   important reproductive trait in many organisms, of 1864 male and 1916
   female common gulls Larus canus collected during 37 years. We show that
   there is both a direct (female) and an indirect (male) genetic effect
   (explaining 14.5\% and 4.8\% of the REML estimated variance in laying
   date, respectively), but these are significantly negatively correlated
   (-0.53 +/- 0.22 SE), indicating that genes for early laying in females
   are associated with genes for a delaying male effect on his partner's
   laying date (and vice versa). There is strong selection for laying early
   in this population, and these sexually antagonistic genetic effects may
   contribute in maintaining the variation in laying date. Our findings
   provide an empirical demonstration of a hitherto largely unstudied level
   of conflict between mates, with important ramifications for our
   understanding of evolutionary dynamics and mate choice in nature.}},

Abstract = {{Kin and levels-of-selection models are common approaches for modelling
   social evolution. Indirect genetic effect (IGE) models represent a
   different approach, specifying social effects on trait values rather
   than fitness. We investigate the joint effect of relatedness, multilevel
   selection and IGEs on response to selection. We present a measure for
   the degree of multilevel selection, which is the natural partner of
   relatedness in expressions for response. Response depends on both
   relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection, rather than only one
   or the other factor. Moreover, response is symmetric in relatedness and
   the degree of multilevel selection, indicating that both factors have
   exactly the same effect. Without IGEs, the key parameter is the product
   of relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection. With IGEs,
   however, multilevel selection without relatedness can explain evolution
   of social traits. Thus, next to relatedness and multilevel selection,
   IGEs are a key element in the genetical theory of social evolution.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of postcopulatory sexual selection typically estimate a male's
   fertilization success from his paternity success (P-2) calculated at
   hatching or birth. However, P-2 may be affected by differential embryo
   viability, thereby confounding estimations of true fertilization success
   (F-2) This study examines the effects of variation in the ability of
   males to influence embryo viability upon the inequality between P-2 and
   F-2. It also investigates the consequences of this inequality for
   testing the hypothesis that polyandrous females accrue viability
   benefits for their offspring through facilitation of sperm competition
   (good-sperm model). Simulations of competitive mating trials show that
   although relative measures of male reproductive success tend to
   underestimate the strength of underlying good-sperm processes,
   good-sperm processes can be seriously overestimated using P-2 values if
   males influence the viability of the embryos they sire. This study
   cautions the interpretation of P-2 values as a proxy for fertilization
   success or sperm competitiveness in studies of postcopulatory sexual
   selection, and highlights that the good-sperm hypothesis needs empirical
   support from studies able to identify and separate unequivocally the

Abstract = {{Sexual selection requires social interactions, particularly between the
   sexes. When trait expression is influenced by social interactions, such
   traits are called interacting phenotypes and only recently have the
   evolutionary consequences of interacting phenotypes been considered.
   Here we investigated how variation in relative fitness, or the
   opportunity for sexual selection, affected the evolutionary trajectories
   of interacting phenotypes. We used experimentally evolved populations of
   the naturally promiscuous Drosophila pseudoobscura, in which the numbers
   of potential interactions between the sexes, and therefore relative
   fitness, were manipulated by altering natural levels of female
   promiscuity. We considered two different mating interactions between the
   sexes: mating speed and copulation duration. We investigated the
   evolutionary trajectories of means and (co)variances (P) and also the
   influence of genetic drift on the evolutionary response of these
   interactions. Our sexual selection treatments did not affect the means
   of either mating speed or copulation duration, but they did affect P. We
   found that the means of both traits differed among replicates within
   each selection treatment whereas the Ps did not. Changes as a
   consequence of genetic drift were excluded. Our results show that
   although variable potential strengths of sexual interactions influence
   the evolution of interacting phenotypes, the influence may be nonlinear.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of female promiscuity poses an intriguing problem as
   benefits of mating with multiple males often have to arise via indirect,
   genetic, effects. Studies on birds have documented that multiple
   paternity is common in natural populations but strong evidence for
   selection via female benefits is lacking. In an attempt to evaluate the
   evidence more broadly, we review studies of multiple paternity in
   natural populations of all major groups of nonavian reptiles. Multiple
   paternity has been documented in all species investigated so far and
   commonly exists in over 50\% of clutches, with particularly high levels
   in snakes and lizards. Marine turtles and lizards with prolonged
   pair-bonding have relatively low levels of multiple paternity but levels
   are nevertheless higher than in many vertebrates with parental care.
   There is no evidence that high levels of polyandry are driven by direct
   benefits to females and the evidence that multiple paternity arises from
   indirect genetic benefits is weak. Instead, we argue that the most
   parsimonious explanation for patterns of multiple paternity is that it
   represents the combined effect of mate-encounter frequency and conflict
   over mating rates between males and females driven by large male
   benefits and relatively small female costs, with only weak selection via
   indirect benefits. A crucial step for researchers is to move from
   correlative approaches to experimental tests of assumptions and
   predictions of theory under natural settings, using a combination of
   molecular techniques and behavioural observations.}},

Title = {{The relative nature of fertilization success: Implications for the study
   of post-copulatory sexual selection}},
Journal = {{BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{Background: The determination of genetic variation in sperm competitive
   ability is fundamental to distinguish between post-copulatory sexual
   selection models based on good-genes vs compatible genes. The sexy-sperm
   and the good-sperm hypotheses for the evolution of polyandry require
   additive (intrinsic) effects of genes influencing sperm competitiveness,
   whereas the genetic incompatibility hypothesis invokes non-additive
   genetic effects. A male's sperm competitive ability is typically
   estimated from his fertilization success, a measure that is dependent on
   the ability of rival sperm competitors to fertilize the ova. It is well
   known that fertilization success may be conditional to genotypic
   interactions among males as well as between males and females. However,
   the consequences of effects arising from the random sampling of sperm
   competitors upon the estimation of genetic variance in sperm
   competitiveness have been overlooked. Here I perform simulations of
   mating trials performed in the context of sibling analysis to
   investigate whether the ability to detect additive genetic variance
   underlying the sperm competitiveness phenotype is hindered by the
   relative nature of fertilization success measurements.
   Results: Fertilization success values render biased sperm competitive
   ability values. Furthermore, asymmetries among males in the errors
   committed when estimating sperm competitive abilities are likely to
   exist as long as males exhibit variation in sperm competitiveness.
   Critically, random effects arising from the relative nature of
   fertilization success lead to an underestimation of underlying additive
   genetic variance in sperm competitive ability.
   Conclusion: The results show that, regardless of the existence of
   genotypic interactions affecting the output of sperm competition,
   fertilization success is not a perfect predictor of sperm competitive
   ability because of the stochasticity of the background used to obtain
   fertilization success measures. Random effects need to be considered in
   the debate over the maintenance of genetic variation in sperm
   competitiveness, and when testing good-genes and compatible-genes
   processes as explanations of polyandrous behaviour using
   repeatability/heritability data in sperm competitive ability. These
   findings support the notion that the genetic incompatibility hypothesis
   needs to be treated as an alternative hypothesis, rather than a null
   hypothesis, in studies that fail to detect intrinsic sire effects on the
   sperm competitiveness phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{In addition to sexual selection, selection resulting from social
   interactions in contexts other than mating can be a potent evolutionary
   force. Such social selection processes are facilitated whenever
   individual fitness varies as a result of any form of social
   interactions. The choice of social partners for communal care of young
   is such a situation in which interactants potentially experience fitness
   variance. In this study, we investigated the existence and impact of
   female social partner choice and the potential for social selection to
   occur in the cooperatively breeding wild house mouse, Mus domesticus. We
   analysed patterns of individual associations in groups of females, and
   compared the reproductive behaviour of females grouped with either a
   preferred or a nonpreferred social partner over an experimental life
   span of half a year, using spatial association as a measure of
   preference. We predicted low reproductive competition among preferred
   social partners and high competition, reflected in lower reproductive
   success, among nonpreferred. Our results showed that female house mice
   displayed nonrandom preferences, and that social partner choice yielded
   significant fitness benefits females in pairs with a preferred partner
   had a significantly higher probability to give birth and to establish an
   egalitarian, cooperative relationship, resulting in higher reproductive
   success than females in nonpreferred pairs. This suggests that
   interactions among females are subject to social selection processes,
   driving the evolution of female traits. (c) 2007 The Association for the

Abstract = {{Conflicts of interest among genetically heterogeneous nestmates in
   social insect colonies have been emphasized as driving colony resource
   allocation. However, potential intracolonial conflicts may not actually
   be realized so that resource allocation could be shaped primarily by
   among-colony selection that maximizes colony productivity. To elucidate
   the causal basis of patterns of resource allocation, I experimentally
   manipulated three fundamental aspects of colony social structure
   (relatedness among workers, relatedness among larvae, and queen
   presence) in the ant Temnothorax curvispinosus and measured effects on
   colony resource allocation to new workers, gynes, and males. The
   experimental manipulations had widespread effects on patterns of colony
   resource allocation, but there was little evidence for realized
   conflicts over the sex ratio and caste ratio. Decreasing nestmate
   relatedness caused decreased colony productivity, suggesting that more
   closely related nestmates have more favorably interacting phenotypes.
   Together, these results suggest that resource allocation in T.
   curvispinosus may be shaped more by among-colony selection than
   intracolonial conflict, leading to queen worker-brood coadaptation.}},

Abstract = {{Social heterosis is when individuals in groups or neighbourhoods receive
   a mutualistic benefit from across-individual genetic diversity. Although
   it can be a viable evolutionary mechanism to maintain allelic diversity
   at a given locus, its efficacy at maintaining genome-wide diversity is
   in question when multiple loci are being simultaneously selected.
   Therefore, we modelled social heterosis in a population of haploid
   genomes of two- or three-linked loci. With such linkages, social
   heterosis decreases gametic diversity, but maintains allelic diversity.
   Genomes tend to survive as complimentary pairs, with alternate alleles
   at each locus (e.g. the pair AbC and aBc). The outcomes of selection
   appear similar to fitness epistasis but are novel in the sense that
   phenotypic interactions occur across rather than within individuals. The
   model's results strongly suggest that strong linkage across gene loci
   actually increases the probability that social heterosis maintains
   significant genetic diversity at the level of the genome.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality due to cannibalism is a major problem in laying hens. Due to
   prohibition of beak-trimming in the European Union, this problem will
   increase in the near future. One solution to reduce mortality due to
   cannibalism is to use genetic selection. Mortality due to cannibalism,
   however, differs from conventional breeding traits, because it depends
   on social interactions among individuals. Selection strategies aiming to
   reduce cannibalism, therefore, should consider both the direct effect of
   an individual on its own survival and the social effect of the
   individual on the survival of its group members (the so-called
   associative effect). Traditional breeding, however, accounts for only
   the direct effect. Recently, methods have been proposed to estimate
   variance components and breeding values for both direct and associative
   effects. This paper presents estimated genetic parameters for direct and
   associative effects on survival days in 3 purebred laying lines. For the
   analysis, 16,780 hens with intact beaks were used. When considering only
   direct effects, heritabilities ranged from 2 through 10\%. When
   considering both direct and associative effects, the total heritable
   variance, expressed as a proportion of phenotypic variance, ranged from
   6 through 19\%. These results show that heritable variation in survival
   days is substantially larger than suggested by conventional direct
   effects models. This means that prospects for reducing mortality by
   means of genetic selection are good and may lead to substantial
   reduction of 1 of the major welfare problems in egg production.}},

Abstract = {{Animal breeding research, reproductive biology, and cellular
   biogerontology show that fertilization rates and zygote viability
   critically depend on sperm age. Sexual selection research focuses on
   differences between male genotypes in sperm performance, such as
   motility, competitive ability, or compatibility with eggs, but without
   considering sperm age. A combined view ( that the thermodynamically
   inevitable decline in sperm performance selects for traits in diploid
   individuals to prevent fertilization with aged sperm) has received very
   little attention. In this paper, I correct this bias and show that many
   male and female traits affect sperm aging or the sperm age distribution
   at any reproductive event. Such traits coincide well with
   condition-dependent traits considered sexually selected: multiple mating
   by both sexes, high sperm production rates, the delivery of dense
   ejaculates containing many sperm ( including nonfertilizing types), the
   packaging of sperm into spermatophores, male and female sperm ejection,
   sexual coercion, as well as the production of showy antioxidants and
   various cellular and nuclear repair mechanisms. I conclude that altering
   the sperm age distribution at any step during reproduction can be an
   origin of sexually selected traits, and may explain presently observed
   paternity variation without assuming genetic incompatibility of gametes.}},

Abstract = {{It is widely assumed that male sperm competitiveness evolves adaptively.
   However, recent studies have found a cytoplasmic genetic component to
   phenotypic variation in some sperm traits presumed important in sperm
   competition. As cytoplasmic genes are maternally transmitted, they
   cannot respond to selection on sperm and this constraint may affect the
   scope in which sperm competitiveness can evolve adaptively. We examined
   nuclear and cytoplasmic genetic contributions to sperm competitiveness,
   using populations of Callosobruchus maculatus carrying orthogonal
   combinations of nuclear and cytoplasmic lineages. Our design also
   enabled us to examine genetic contributions to female remating. We found
   that sperm competitiveness and remating are primarily encoded by nuclear
   genes. In particular, a male's sperm competitiveness phenotype was
   contingent on an interaction between the competing male genotypes.
   Furthermore, cytoplasmic effects were detected on remating but not sperm
   competitiveness, suggesting that cytoplasmic genes do not generally play
   a profound evolutionary role in sperm competition.}},

Abstract = {{Natural and sexual selection are crucial factors in the evolutionary
   process, yet recent reviews show that researchers have focused narrowly
   on this topic, with the majority of research centered on the
   morphological traits of single species. However, in the past several
   years, several bodies of work have emerged that have examined both
   selection on performance capacity and selection in a community context,
   and our goal is to highlight these two growing areas and point toward
   future directions. Recent studies of selection on performance capacity
   point toward directional selection favoring high levels of performance,
   and we detected less evidence for selection favoring intermediate (i.
   e., stabilizing) or bimodal (i. e., disruptive) kinds of performance
   levels. Studies of selection in a community context, using the paradigm
   of indirect genetic effects, show significant community heritability and
   strong capacity for evolution to occur in a community context via the
   force of natural selection. For future directions, we argue that
   researchers should shift toward longer-term studies of selection on both
   individual species and communities, and we also encourage researchers to
   publish negative selection results for both performance and community
   studies to act as balancing influences on published positive selection
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Many conspicuous ornamental traits in animals are expressed in both
   males and females. Despite this, most research has focused on sexually
   dimorphic ornamentation. Mutual ornamentation has often been viewed as a
   result of either a nonadaptive genetic correlation between the sexes or
   similar selection pressures in both sexes. Here, we review the
   theoretical underpinning and empirical evidence for these ideas. Few
   studies have attempted to test empirically whether a genetic correlation
   between the sexes can constrain the evolution of sexual dimorphism, and
   the results have been mixed. By contrast, there is good evidence that
   mutual ornaments can have a signal function in both sexes, especially in
   terms of mate choice. Other possible signalling functions have received
   little attention. Social status signalling is especially likely to be
   important, because competition over nonsexual resources is more balanced
   between the sexes than sexual competition. There is a need for
   experimental studies that explicitly test these hypotheses
   simultaneously in both sexes.}},

Abstract = {{Maternal effects facilitate adaptation to changing environments because

   adaptation to more complex environments. In side-blotched lizards (Uta
   stansburiana), two alternative pathways of dorsal pattern induction
   involve maternal oestradiol and alleles for throat colouration (similar
   to social strategy). In one pathway, females increased yolk oestradiol
   when mated to yellow-throated sires; oestradiol induced dorsal barring
   in yellow-throated progeny of both sexes. In another pathway, females
   elevated yolk oestradiol in response to a high frequency of orange

Abstract = {{Nonadditive effects of group membership are generated when individuals
   respond differently to the same social environment and may alter
   predictions about how behavioural evolution will occur. Despite this
   importance, the relationship between an individual's behaviour in two
   different social contexts and how reciprocal interactions among
   individuals within groups influence group behaviour are poorly
   understood. Guppy anti-predator behaviour can be used to explore how
   individuals behaviourally respond to changes in social context.
   Individuals from two strains were tested for response to a model
   predator alone and in groups to evaluate how individuals alter their
   behaviour in response to social context and bow group phenotype relates
   to individual behaviour. Nonadditive effects of group membership were
   detected for a number of behaviours, revealing that the effect of being
   in a group differed among individuals. These nonadditive effects,
   however, yielded an additive group phenotype. That is, the average
   behaviour of the group was equal to the average of its parts, for all
   behaviours in both strains. Such an additive group phenotype may have
   resulted because all individuals within a group respond to the specific
   social environment provided by the other members of their group.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects arise when genes expressed in one individual
   affect the expression of traits in other individuals. The importance of
   indirect genetic effects has been recognized for a diversity of
   evolutionary processes including kin selection, sexual selection,
   community structure and multilevel selection, but data regarding their
   genetic architecture and prevalence throughout the genome remain scarce,
   especially for interactions between unrelated individuals. Using a set
   of 411 Bay-0 x Shahdara Arabidopsis recombinant inbred lines grown with
   Landsberg neighbours, we examined quantitative trait loci (QTL) having
   direct and indirect effects on size, developmental, and fitness related
   traits. Using an interval mapping approach, we identified 15 QTL with
   direct effects and found that 13 of these QTL had significant indirect
   effects on trait expression in neighbouring plants. These results
   suggest widespread pleiotropy, as nearly all direct effect QTL have
   associated pleiotropic indirect effects. Paradoxically, most indirect
   effects were of the same sign as direct effects, creating a pattern of
   nearly universal positive pleiotropy that makes most covariances between
   direct and indirect effects positive. These results are consistent with
   a complex genetic basis for intraspecific interactions, but suggest that
   interactions between neighbouring plants are largely positive, rather
   than negative as would be expected for competition. In addition to their
   evolutionary and ecological importance, these pleiotropic relationships
   between DGE and IGE loci have implications for quantitative genetic
   studies of natural populations as well as experimental design
   considerations. Additionally, studies that ignore IGEs may over- or
   underestimate quantitative genetic parameters, as well as the effect of
   and variance contributed by QTL.}},

Abstract = {{Females often prefer males with elaborate traits, even when they receive
   no direct benefits from their choice. In such situations, mate
   discrimination presumably has genetic advantages; selective females will
   produce offspring of higher genetic quality. Over time, persistent
   female preferences for elaborate secondary-sexual traits in males should
   erode genetic variance in these traits, eventually eliminating any
   benefit to the preferences. Yet, strong female preferences persist in
   many taxa. This puzzle is called the lek paradox and raises two primary
   questions: do females obtain genetic benefits for offspring by selecting
   males with elaborate secondary-sexual characteristics and, if so, how is
   the genetic variation in these male traits maintained? We suggest that
   indirect genetic effects may help to resolve the lek paradox. Maternal
   phenotypes, such as habitat selection behaviours and offspring
   provisioning, often influence the condition and the expression of
   secondary-sexual traits in sons. These maternal influences are commonly
   genetic based (i.e. they are indirect genetic effects). Females choosing
   mates with elaborate traits may receive `good genes' for daughters in
   the form of effective maternal characteristics. Recognizing the
   significance of indirect genetic effects may be important to our
   understanding of the process and consequences of sexual selection.}},

Journal = {{AMERICAN NATURALIST}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{169}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{E84-E96}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Maternal hormones in the yolk of birds' eggs have been a focus of
   attention in behavioral and evolutionary ecology stimulated by the
   pioneering work of Hubert Schwabl. Since then, knowledge of both the
   factors that influence maternal deposition patterns and their
   consequences for offspring development has accumulated rapidly. To date,
   the field has been dominated by the idea that mothers use yolk hormones
   to adaptively adjust offspring development, a view that assigns control
   over hormone deposition and its effects on the offspring to the mother.
   This neglects the possibility that the evolutionary interests of the
   mother and offspring differ. When there is such parent-offspring
   conflict, the offspring are selected to respond to the hormones in a way
   that is adaptive for themselves rather than for the mother. Moreover,
   sexual conflict between the parents over parental investment may shape
   the evolution of yolk hormone deposition: females may manipulate the
   male's contribution to parental care through the effect of yolk hormones
   on offspring begging, competitiveness, and developmental rate. We
   therefore suggest that for a full understanding of the evolution of
   hormone-mediated maternal effects, it is essential to study both fitness
   consequences and physiological mechanisms and constraints from the
   perspective of all family members.}},

Volume = {{17}},

Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Although females are expected to maximize their reproductive success
   with only one or a few matings {[}1], the females of many species mate
   with multiple partners {[}2]. Experimental studies have found evidence
   for an increase in egg or embryo viability when females mate
   polyandrously {[}3]. These studies have been interpreted in the context
   of genetic-benefit models that propose that multiple mating increases
   offspring viability because it allows females to select male genotypes
   that influence viability directly or because it allows females to avoid
   genetic incompatibility {[}2, 4-8]. However, no studies have examined
   directly the precise mechanisms by which parents influence embryo
   viability. Using a morphological marker that enabled us to determine
   paternity and survival of embryos sired by individual male crickets in
   both sperm-competitive and -noncompetitive situations, we show that
   males inducing high embryo viability enhance the viability of embryos
   sired by inferior males. These results indicate that paternal effects
   and interacting phenotypes determine embryo viability. They show that a
   male's reproductive success is modified by the interaction between
   indirect genetic effects of sperm competitors. Importantly, our findings
   show that the benefits accruing to offspring of multiply mated females
   need not be transmitted genetically.}},

Abstract = {{When social interactions occur, the phenotype of an individual is
   influenced directly by its own genes (direct genetic effects) but also
   indirectly by genes expressed in social partners (indirect genetic
   effects). Social insect colonies are characterized by extensive
   behavioral interactions among workers, brood, and queens so that
   indirect genetic effects are particularly relevant. I used a series of
   experimental manipulations to disentangle the contribution of direct
   effects, maternal (queen) effects, and sibsocial (worker) effects to
   variation for worker, gyne, and male mass; caste ratio; and sex ratio in
   the ant Temnothorax curvispinosus. The results indicate genetic variance
   for direct, maternal, and sibsocial effects for all traits, except for
   male mass there was no significant maternal variance, and for sex ratio
   the variance for direct effects was not separable from maternal variance
   for the primary sex ratio. Estimates of genetic correlations between
   direct, maternal, and sibsocial effects were generally negative,
   indicating that these effects may not evolve independently. These
   results have broad implications for social insect evolution. For
   example, the genetic architecture underlying social insect traits may
   constrain the realization of evolutionary conflicts between social

Abstract = {{The evolutionary analysis of community organization is considered a
   major frontier in biology. Nevertheless, current explanations for
   community structure exclude the effects of genes and selection at levels
   above the individual. Here. we demonstrate a genetic basis for community
   structure, arising from the fitness consequences of genetic interactions
   among species (i.e., interspecific indirect genetic effects or IIGEs).
   Using simulated and natural communities of arthropods inhabiting North
   American cottonwoods (Populus), we show that when species comprising
   ecological communities are summarized using a multivariate statistical
   method, nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). the resulting
   univariate scores can be analyzed using standard techniques for
   estimating the heritability of quantitative traits. Our estimates of the
   broad-sense heritability of arthropod communities on known genotypes of
   cottonwood trees in common gardens explained 56-63\% of the total
   variation in community phenotype. To justify and help interpret our
   empirical approach, we modeled synthetic communities in which the
   number, intensity, and fitness consequences of the genetic interactions
   among species comprising the community were explicitly known. Results
   from the model suggest that our empirical estimates of broad-sense
   community heritability arise from heritable variation in a host tree
   trait and the fitness consequences of IGEs that extend from tree trait
   to arthropods. When arthropod traits are heritable, interspecific IGEs
   cause species interactions to change, and community evolution occurs.
   Our results have implications for establishing the genetic foundations
   of communities and ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies on hormone-mediated maternal effects in birds have
   highlighted the influence of variable maternal yolk androgen
   concentration on offspring phenotype, particularly in terms of early
   development. If genetic differences between laying females regulate
   variation in yolk hormone concentration, then this physiological
   maternal effect is an indirect genetic effect which can provide a basis
   for the co-evolution of maternal and offspring phenotypes. Thus, we
   investigated the evolutionary associations between maternally derived
   yolk testosterone (T) and early developmental traits in passerine birds
   via a comparative, phylogenetic analysis. Our results from
   species-correlation and independent contrasts analyses provide
   convergent evidence for the correlated evolution of maternal yolk T
   concentration and length of the prenatal developmental period in
   passerines. Here, we show these traits are significantly negatively
   associated (species-correlation: p<0.001, r(2) = 0.85; independent
   contrasts: p=0.005). Our results highlight the need for more studies

Abstract = {{The evolution of parent-offspring interactions for the provisioning of
   care is usually explained as the phenotypic outcome of resolved
   conflicting selection pressures. However, parental care and offspring
   solicitation are expected to have complex patterns of inheritance. Here
   we present a quantitative genetic model of parent-offspring interactions
   that allows us to investigate the evolutionary maintenance of a state of
   resolved conflict. We show that offspring solicitation and parental
   provisioning are expected to become genetically correlated through
   coadaptation and that their genetic architecture is dictated by an
   interaction between patterns of selection and the proximate mechanisms
   regulating supply and demand. When selection is predominately on
   offspring solicitation, our model suggests that the genetic correlations
   between provisioning and solicitation are usually positive if
   provisioning reduces solicitation. Conversely, when selection is
   predominately on parental provisioning, the correlations are mostly
   negative as long as parents show a positive response to offspring
   demand. Empirical estimates of the genetic architecture of traits
   involved in family interactions fit these predictions. Our model
   demonstrates how the evolutionary maintenance of parent-offspring
   interactions can result in variable patterns of coadaptation, and it
   provides an explanation for the diversity of family interactions within

Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the evolutionary origin and elaboration of sociality using an
   indirect genetic effects perspective. Indirect genetic effects models
   simultaneously consider zygotic genes, genes expressed in social
   partners (especially mothers and siblings), and the interactions between
   them. Incorporation of these diverse genetic effects should lead to more
   realistic models of social evolution. We first review haplodiploidy as a
   factor that promotes the evolution of eusociality. Social insect
   biologists have doubted the importance of relatedness asymmetry caused
   by hoplodiploidy and focused on other predisposing factors such as
   maternal care. However, indirect effects theory shows that maternal care
   evolves more readily in haplodiploids, especially with inbreeding and
   despite multiple mating. Because extended maternal care is believed to
   be a precondition for the evolution of eusociality, the evolutionary
   bias towards maternal care in haplodiploids may result in a further bias
   towards eusocialily in these groups. Next, we compare kin selection and
   parental manipulation and then briefly review additional hypotheses for
   the evolutionary origin of eusociality. We present a verbal model for
   the evolutionary origin and elaboration of sib-social care from maternal
   care based on the modification of the timing of expression of maternal
   care behaviors. Specifically, heterochrony genes cause maternal care
   behaviors to be expressed prereproductively towards siblings instead of
   postreproductively towards offspring. Our review demonstrates that both
   maternal effect genes (expressed in a parental manipulation manner) and
   direct effect zygotic genes (expressed in an offspring control manner)
   are likely involved in the evolution of eusociality. We conclude by
   describing theoretical and empirical advances with indirect genetic
   effects and sociogenomics, and me provide specific quantitative genetic
   and genomic predictions from our heterochrony model for the evolutionary
   origin and elaboration of eusociality.}},

Abstract = {{Using a set of nine effectively isogenic lines collected from nature in
   1998, we observed unperturbed behaviors of mixed-sex groups of
   Drosophila melanogaster. We repeatedly scanned replicated groups of
   genetically identical individuals, five females and five males, and
   recorded the behavior of each individual (i.e., walking, feeding,
   grooming, flying, courting, mating, fighting, or resting). From these
   behaviors, we made a composite variable of activity for-our quantitative
   genetic analysis. Genotypes differed in activity, explaining 14.41\% of
   the variation in activity; 8.60\% of the variation was explained by a
   significant genotype X sex interaction, which signifies genetic
   variation for sexual dimorphism in behavior. Phenotypic plasticity
   explained 11.13\% of the variation in activity. Different genotypes and
   sexes within genotypes had different rank orders of the component
   behaviors that contribute to activity. We found no effect of common
   rearing environment. Instead, differences between replicate groups
   within genotype accounted for 19.47\% variation in activity, and
   activity was significantly repeatable across scans. This emergent group
   behavior is likely caused by differences between groups of interacting
   individuals, even though individuals were genetically identical across
   groups. Thus, emergent group behavior explained almost as much variation
   in activity as the combined sources of genetic variation (23.01\%), and
   this is an additional level on which selection could operate:
   individuals and groups. We discuss how differences among groups could
   change patterns of additive genetic variation available for evolution.
   Furthermore, because the behavior of an individual is influenced by
   conspecifics, genotype interactions between individuals could contribute
   to indirect selection. Finally, if we consider activity as a syndrome
   governing all component behaviors with strong genetic correlations among
   behaviors within an individual, then these component behaviors cannot
   evolve independently. These results suggest that reductionist approaches
   of molecular behavior genetics may be incomplete and/or misleading when
   considering similar phenotypes at the population level or when trying to
   understand how behaviors evolve.}},

Abstract = {{Females typically mate with more than one male despite the costs
   incurred, thus questioning Bateman's principle. A series of genetic
   benefits have been proposed to account for the evolution of polyandry,
   including the acquisition of viability genes for offspring. The
   `intrinsic male quality' hypothesis suggests that polyandry increases
   the probability that females produce offspring sired by males that
   bestow high viability on their offspring. Heritable variation in
   viability is the basic requirement for the occurrence of this genetic
   benefit. By using a half-sib breeding design with a species of cricket
   in which polyandry is known to increase hatching success, we present
   clear experimental evidence that intrinsic male quality contributes to
   embryo viability. Despite recent support for the evolution of polyandry
   based on compatibility of genotypes between males and females, we show
   that hatching success is not determined by an interaction between
   paternal and maternal genotypes but rather that sons inherit paternal
   genes that influence the viability of eggs laid by their mates.
   Moreover, our data implicate a potential role for indirect genetic
   effects of male accessory gland products on embryo viability. Additive
   genetic contributions to embryo viability may be an important factor
   underlying the frequently observed benefits of polyandrous behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Records of on-test ADG of Large White gilts were analyzed to estimate
   variance components of direct and associative genetic effects. Models
   included the effects of contemporary group (farm-barn-batch), birth
   litter, pen group, and direct and associative additive genetic effects.
   The area of each pen was 14 m(2). The additive genetic variance was a
   function of the number of competitors in a group, the additive
   relationships between the animal performing the record and its pen
   mates, and the additive relationships between pen mates. To partially
   account for differences in the number of pen mates, a covariable (q(i) =
   1, 1/n, or 1/n(1/2)) was added to the associative genetic effect. There
   were 4,946 records from 2,409 litters and 362 pen groups. Pen group size
   ranged from 12 to 16 gilts. Analyses by REML converged very slowly. A
   grid search showed that the likelihood function was almost flat when the
   additive genetic associative effect was fitted. Estimates of direct and
   associative heritability were 0.15 and 0.03, respectively. Within the
   BLUPF90 family of programs, the mixed-model equations can be set up
   directly. For variance component estimation, simple programs (REMLF90
   and GIBBSF90) worked without modifications, but more optimized programs
   did not. Estimates obtained using the three values of q(i) were similar.
   With the data structure available for this study and under an
   environment with relative low competition among animals, accurate
   estimation of associative genetic effects was not possible. Estimation
   of competitive effects with large pen size is difficult. The magnitude
   of competition effects may be larger in commercial populations, where
   housing is denser and food is limited.}},

Abstract = {{Different aspects of male quality as a mate can vary independently. When
   this is the case, females may need to use multiple cues to accurately
   assess overall mate quality. We examined the pattern of mating
   preference in the cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea. Sexual conflict occurs in
   this species because male manipulation of female mating receptivity can
   result in reduced female fitness. We predicted that since females cannot
   remate within a single reproductive bout because of male manipulation,
   females should assess male mating history to avoid mating with males
   with low fertility caused by sperm exhaustion. In a mate-preference
   experiment, we found that females discriminated against males who had
   mated multiple times. Females also discriminated against males who had
   consorted with several females but had been prevented from mating with
   those females. Thus, females appeared to be able to detect cues on males
   that were derived from previous mates and to use this information to
   avoid mating with sperm-exhausted males. We suggest that females may
   commonly use multiple cues to assess different aspects of mate quality,
   especially when male quality changes over time. This is an under-studied
   phenomenon that could help explain individual variation in female mating
   preferences.}},

Abstract = {{Evolutionary conflict arises between reproductive partners when
   alternative reproductive opportunities are available. Sexual conflict
   can generate sexually antagonistic selection, which mediates sexual
   selection and intersexual coevolution. However, despite intense
   interest, the evolutionary implications of sexual conflict remain
   unresolved. We propose a novel theoretical approach to study the
   evolution of sexually antagonistic phenotypes based on quantitative
   genetics and the measure of social selection arising from male-female
   interactions. We consider the phenotype of one sex as both a genetically
   influenced evolving trait as well as the (evolving) social environment
   in which the phenotype of the opposite sex evolves. Several important
   points emerge from our analysis, including the relationship between
   direct selection on one sex and indirect effects through selection on
   the opposite sex. We suggest that the proposed approach may be a
   valuable tool to complement other theoretical approaches currently used
   to study sexual conflict. Most importantly, our approach highlights
   areas where additional empirical data can help clarify the role of
   sexual conflict in the evolutionary process.}},

Abstract = {{During sexual encounters, individuals often use signals, such as display
   traits, to attract mates. if individuals alter their display traits with
   respect to the genotype of potential mates, indirect genetic effects
   (IGEs) may occur in which the genes of one individual influence the
   phenotype of another. Although IGEs between related individuals have
   received much attention, their occurrence between unrelated individuals
   during sexual encounters has not. Here, we demonstrate that in the
   Australian fruit fly Drosophila serrata, males assess females by using
   both visual and olfactory cues, resulting in a rapid plastic response
   (within minutes) in male cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), a display trait
   that is an important target of mate choice. Several CHCs in males
   exhibited significant IGEs, and IGEs were inducible on both males reared
   in the laboratory and on field-caught individuals. A vector describing
   genetic variance in multiple CHCs in females was found to be almost
   identical to a vector describing indirect genetic variance in male CHCs,
   suggesting that males might assess female CHCs during courtship. This
   vector displayed contributions from all female CHCs in the same
   direction and of similar magnitude, suggesting that female condition may
   be the underlying casual trait that males are assessing. Consistent with
   this interpretation, when measured directly in a separate experiment,
   genetic variance in female condition accounted for 19.8\% of the
   indirect genetic variance in male CHCs. These indirect genetic effects
   have the potential to alter the response to selection of male sexual
   display traits.}},

Abstract = {{Germination responses to seasonal conditions determine the environment
   experienced by postgermination life stages, and this ability has
   potential consequences for the evolution of plant life histories. Using
   recombinant inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana, we tested whether
   life-history characters exhibited plasticity to germination timing,
   whether germination timing influenced the strength and mode of natural
   selection on life-history traits, and whether germination timing
   influenced the expression of genetic variation for life-history traits.
   Adult life-history traits exhibited strong plasticity to season of
   germination, and season of germination significantly altered the
   strength, mode, and even direction of selection on life-history traits
   under some conditions. None of the average plastic responses to season
   of germination or season of dispersal were adaptive, although some
   genotypes within our sample did exhibit adaptive responses. Thus,
   recombination between inbred lineages created some novel adaptive
   genotypes with improved responses to the seasonal timing of germination
   under some, but not all, conditions. Genetically based variation in
   germination time tended to augment genetic variances of adult
   life-history traits, but it did not increase the heritabilities because
   it also increased environmentally induced variance. Under some
   conditions, plasticity of life-history traits in response to genetically
   variable germination timing actually obscured genetic variation for
   those traits. Therefore, the evolution of germination responses can
   influence the evolution of life histories in a general manner by
   altering natural selection on life-history traits and the genetic
   variation of these traits.}},

Abstract = {{Inbred strains of mice, such as BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6ByJ, have been used
   repeatedly to study genotype-phenotype relations. These strains differ
   on behavioral measures of fear. In novel environments, for example,
   BALB/c mice are substantially more neophobic than C57BL/6 animals. The
   benzodiazepine (BZ)/GABA(A) receptor system has been proposed as a
   regulator of behavioral responses to stress, and BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice
   differ in BZ/GABA(A) receptor binding. In the present study, we found
   increased BZ receptor levels in C57BL/6 mice in the central and
   basolateral nuclei of the amygdala as well as the locus coeruleus using
   either flunitrazepam (nonselective) or zolpidem (alpha1 subtype
   selective) as radioligands, Differences in receptor binding were most
   pronounced in the amygdala and locus coeruleus using {[}H-3]zolpidem.
   C57BL/6 mice showed increased alpha1 mRNA levels in the locus coeuruleus
   compared to BALB/c mice. In addition, gamma2 mRNA expression in BALB/c
   mice was decreased in the central nucleus of the amygdala to levels that
   were 2-2.5-fold lower than those of C57BL/6 mice. The results of an
   adoption study revealed that the biological offspring of C37BL/6 mothers
   fostered after birth to BALB/c dams showed decreased levels of 2 mRNA
   expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala in comparison to peers
   fostered to other C57BL/6 mothers (the reverse was found for the
   biological offspring of BALB/c mothers). In a step-down exploration
   paradigm, BALB/cByJ mice crossfostered onto a C57BL/6ByJ dam expressed
   reduced anxiety responses. However, among C57BL/6ByJ mice, the
   relatively low levels of anxiety ordinarily evident were not increased
   when mice of this strain were reared by a BALB/cByJ darn. These
   preliminary findings suggest that the strain differences in the BZ/GABAA
   receptor system occur, at least in part, as a function of parental care.
   Such findings may reflect a mammalian example of an indirect genetic
   effect mediated by maternal care.}},

Abstract = {{Stocking and introduction of fishes began in Newfoundland and Labrador

   Direct genetic effects have been caused by interbreeding with native
   species. Indirect genetic effects may have resulted from selective
   forces, genetic drift and inbreeding. Aquaculture and the creation of
   transgenic fish also pose a new threat to native fish. The effects of
   introductions as mitigation or enhancement tools are discussed. Although

Abstract = {{The expression of most developmental or behavioral traits involves
   complex interactions between quantitative trait loci (QTL) from the

   a pivotal role in shaping the direction and rate of evolution in terms

   To study the genetics and evolution of maternal-offspring interactions,
   a unifying statistical framework that embraces both the direct and
   indirect genetic effects of maternal and offspring QTL on any complex
   trait is developed. This model is derived for a simple backcross design
   within the maximum-likelihood context, implemented with the EM
   algorithm. Results front extensive simulations suggest that this model
   can provide reasonable estimation of additive and dominant effects of
   the QTL at different generations and their interaction effects derived
   from the maternal and offspring genomes. Although our model is trained
   to characterize the actions and interactions of maternal and offspring
   QTL affecting offspring traits, the idea can be readily extended to
   decipher the genetic machinery of maternal traits, Such as maternal

Abstract = {{Social dominance influences the outcome of competitive interactions over
   limited resources, and may hence be important for individual fitness.
   Theory thus predicts that its heritability will be low and that
   non-genetic determinants of dominance should prevail. In this field
   experiment we reciprocally cross-fostered great tits (Parus major) to
   blue tits (Parus caeruleus) to investigate the impact of early social
   experience on dominance status in competition over food during winter.
   Controlling for potential effects of age, size, sex and site-related
   dominance, we show that cross-fostered birds of both species were
   subdominant to conspecific immigrants, while controls originating from
   unmanipulated broods were dominant to conspecific immigrants.
   Furthermore, blue tits reared by blue tit parents but with at least one
   great tit broodmate had lower dominance status relative to conspecific
   immigrants than did controls. Although great tits generally dominated
   blue tits, cross-fostered birds of both species initiated marginally
   more fights against the other species than did their respective
   controls, suggesting faulty species recognition. Since both social
   parents and broodmates strongly influence the dominance behavior of
   offspring later in life, we conclude that social conditions experienced
   at an early age are crucial for the determination of subsequent social
   dominance.}},

Abstract = {{Mothers often provide much of the early environment for their offspring.
   These maternal effects are predicted to result in unusual evolutionary
   dynamics in offspring traits if they are themselves heritable, but these
   important predictions have not previously, to our knowledge, been tested
   in the wild. Here, we quantified the responses of red squirrels
   (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) to documented episodes of natural selection
   and found support for both of the fundamental predictions of models that
   describe maternal effect evolution. First, changes in juvenile growth
   rates across one generation of selection were five times greater than
   predicted by heritability (h(2)) alone, but were consistent with the
   additional contribution of maternal genetic effects. Second, responses
   to selection were influenced not only by the strength of selection in
   the current generation, but also by selection in the previous
   generation, indicating the presence of evolutionary momentum. These
   results were in agreement with predictions of a simple model including
   litter size as the only maternal effect, and provide, to our knowledge,
   the first empirical evidence for the importance of maternal effects to
   evolutionary dynamics in a natural population.}},

Abstract = {{The past 30 years of immunological research have revealed much about the
   proximate mechanisms of maternal antibody transmission and utilization,
   but have not adequately addressed how these issues are related to
   evolutionary and ecological theory. Much remains to be learned about
   individual differences within a species in maternal antibody
   transmission as well as differences among species in transmission or
   utilization of antibodies. Similarly, maternal-effects theory has
   generally neglected the mechanisms by which mothers influence offspring
   phenotype. Although the environmental cues that generate maternal
   effects and the consequent effects for offspring phenotype are often
   well characterized, the intermediary physiological and developmental
   steps through which the maternal effect is transmitted are generally
   unknown. Integration of the proximate mechanisms of maternal antibody
   transmission with evolutionary theory on maternal effects affords an
   important opportunity to unite mechanism and process by focusing on the
   links between genetics, environment and physiology, with the ultimate
   goal of explaining differences among individuals and species in the

Abstract = {{Animals with determinate growth have shown little variation in

   a hatchery-based population of Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus ,
   Salmonidae, using the infinite-dimensional model and including the

   in growth trajectories: individuals that were small (in relation to the
   mean) early in life were among the smallest 2.5 years later. If the
   genetic variation reflects phenotypic variation, not much evolutionary
   change can be expected. Our results show that there are ecological
   conditions that determine the strong covariation of size across ages,
   most likely size-related dominance behaviour, which can mask the true
   variation of growth patterns. Thus, social interactions can have strong

Abstract = {{Recently, doubt has been cast on studies supporting good genes sexual
   selection by the suggestion that observed genetic benefits for offspring
   may be confounded by differential maternal allocation. In traditional
   analyses, observed genetic sire effects on offspring phenotype may
   result from females allocating more resources to the offspring of
   attractive males. However, maternal effects such as differential
   allocation may represent a mechanism promoting genetic sire effects,
   rather than an alternative to them. Here we report results from an
   experiment on the horned dung beetle Onthophagus taurus, in which we
   directly compare genetic sire effects with maternal effects that are
   dependent on sire phenotype. We found strong evidence that mothers
   provide more resources to offspring when mated with large-horned males.
   There were significant heritabilities for both horn length and body
   size, but when differential maternal effects were controlled, the
   observed estimates of genetic variance were greatly reduced. Our
   experiment provides evidence that differential maternal effects may
   amplify genetic effects on offspring traits that are closely related to
   fitness. Thus, our results may partly explain the relatively high
   coefficients of additive genetic variation observed in fitness-related
   traits and provide empirical support for the theoretical argument that
   maternal effects can play an important role in evolution.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of plants to sense their environment gives them the capacity
   to respond to it plastically. Plastic responses, in turn, frequently
   alter the environment that plants experience. Plants can modify the
   environment they experience through many mechanisms-some approximate but
   others quite precise. The ability of plants to modify the environment
   they experience can strongly influence the evolution of characters
   expressed subsequently. A review of some theoretical models of habitat
   selection and of the coevolution of characters and their environments
   highlights the importance of habitat selection in plants. Novel
   evolutionary trajectories and outcomes result when organisms are capable
   of modifying the environment they experience. Specifically, characters
   can evolve even if they have no genetic variation, and plasticity in
   environment-determining characters may promote specialization in others.
   Divergence and reproductive isolation may even be augmented by
   habitat-selecting behavior in plants. An understanding of basic
   character evolution and the evolution of plasticity in plants requires
   an appreciation of the ability of plants to modify the environment they

Abstract = {{The environment provided by conspecifics is often the most important
   component of the environment experienced by individuals, frequently
   having profound effects on fitness and trait expression. Although these
   social effects on fitness and trait expression may appear to be purely
   environmental, they differ from other sorts of environmental influences,
   because they can have a genetic basis and thus can contribute to
   evolution. Theory has shown that these effects modify the definition of
   genetic architecture by making the phenotype the property of the
   genotypes of multiple individuals and alter evolutionary dynamics by
   introducing additional heritable components contributing to trait
   evolution. These effects suggest that genetic and evolutionary analyses
   of traits influenced by social environments must incorporate the genetic
   components of variation contributed by these environments. However,
   empirical studies incorporating these effects are generally lacking. In
   this paper, I quantify the contribution of genetically based
   environmental effects arising from social interactions during group
   rearing to the quantitative genetics of body size in Drosophila
   melanogaster. The results demonstrate that the genetic architecture of
   body size contains an important component of variation contributed by
   the social environment, which is hidden to ordinary genetic analyses and
   opposes the direct effects of genes on body-size development within a
   population. Using a model of trait evolution, I show that these effects
   significantly alter evolutionary predictions by providing hidden
   constraints on phenotypic evolution. The importance of relatedness of
   interactants and the potential impact of kin selection on the evolution
   of body size are also examined.}},

Abstract = {{One specialized environment that can influence development arises in the
   context of social interactions, including the environment contributed by
   a sexual partner during sexual reproduction. It is often difficult,
   however, to separate out the effect of mating (fertilization) from the
   effect of social environment. In the study reported here we examine the
   effect of social environment mediated by a pheromonal signal on the
   fertility and fecundity of the facultatively parthenogenetic cockroach
   Nauphoeta cinerea. By examining parthenogenetically reproducing females,
   we isolate the effects of social environment in the absence of mating or
   fertilization. Females exposed to male odors are more likely to produce
   parthenogenetic offspring. Further, increased exposure to the male
   pheromone increases the number of offspring produced. Variation in
   timing of reproduction is also dependent on the male. Thus, social
   environments are a mechanism by which males contribute to the
   development of their offspring, resulting in variation in development.
   This study illustrates the potential evolutionary importance of social
   environments in development, because a requirement for male-contributed
   environments may be a constraint to evolving asexual reproduction from a
   sexually reproducing species.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Heritabilities, commonly used to predict evolutionary-potential, are
   notoriously low for behaviors. Apart from strong contributions of
   environmental variance in reducing heritabilities, the additive genetic
   components can be very low, especially when they are camouflaged by
   nonadditive genetic effects. We first report the heritabilities of
   courtship traits in founder-flush and control populations of the
   housefly (Musca domestica L.). We estimated the heritability of each
   male and female display through the regression of the courtships
   involving daughters and sons (with randomly selected mates) onto the
   ``midparental{''} courtship values of their parents. Overall, the
   average heritability was significantly (P=.012) higher for the
   parent-daughter assays than for the parent-son assays. We attributed the
   low (even negative) heritabilities to genotype-by-environment
   interactions whereby the male's behavior is influenced by the
   ``environment{''} of his mating partner's preferences for the display,
   generating epistasis through indirect genetic effects. Moreover,
   bottlenecked lines had up to 800\% of the heritability of the controls,
   suggesting ``conversion{''} of additive genetic variance from
   nonadditive components. Second, we used line-cross assays on separate
   populations that had been selected for divergence in mating behavior to
   identify dominance and epistasis through heterosis and outbreeding
   depression in courtship. Finally, our literature review confirms the
   prevalence of such low heritabilities (i.e., a conservative mean of
   0.38) and nonadditive genetics in other behavioral repertoires (64\% of
   the studies). We conclude that animal behavior is especially prone to
   the gamut of quantitative genetic complexities that can result in
   negative heritabilities, negative selection responses, inbreeding
   depression, conversion, heterosis, and outbreeding depression.}},

Abstract = {{Although the argument over genetic influences on social dominance is
   contentious, genetic models of interacting phenotypes provide a
   theoretical framework for heritable effects on, and therefore evolution
   of, social behavior. Here we adapt the interacting phenotype model to
   show how social dominance can evolve. Our model makes a number of
   predictions: rapid evolution of behavior, strong correlated responses in
   associated traits (such as a badge of status), and, because context is
   important for social dominance, integrated evolution of both dominant
   and subordinate behavior reflecting direct and indirect genetic effects
   and social selection. We also describe the results of empirical work,
   artificial selection based on social status within a hierarchy in the
   cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea, that we used to test the predictions of our
   model. There was little change within selection lines in the expression
   of agonistic behavior, but by just generation 7 of selection, in
   comparisons between lines, high-line males consistently dominated low
   and control males, while low-line males were consistently subordinate to
   high-line and control males. There was a strong correlated response to
   selection in the pheromonal badge of status. Some correlated responses
   to selection differed among replicate lines, with the compound that
   makes males subordinate changed in one replicate, while the compound
   that confers dominance was altered in the other. Overall, our results
   are consistent with predictions from models of interacting phenotypes:
   social dominance is influenced by additive genetic variation, can evolve
   as a result of social selection, and evolution of social interactions
   appears to be rapid. Finally, different responses in the replicates
   allowed us to test very specific predictions regarding the role of the
   social pheromone in N. cinerea, highlighting the value of artificial
   selection experiments as a tool in evolutionary behavioral genetic
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{The basis of social evolution in mammals is the mother-offspring
   relationship. It is also the primary and most important instance of
   indirect genetic effects, where genetic variation in one individual
   affects phenotypic variation among others. this relationship is so
   important in mammals that often the major factor determining the life or
   death of newborns is the environment provided by their mother.
   Variations in these environments can be, due to variations in maternal
   genotypes. in our work with the intercross of two mouse inbred strains,
   LG/J and SM/J, we uncovered a very severe variation in maternal
   performance. These females failed to nurture their offspring and showed
   abnormal maternal behaviors. leading to loss of their litter. Rather
   than this being due to a single gene variant as in knockout mice, we
   uncovered a complex genetic basis for this trait. The effects of genes
   on maternal performance are entirely context dependent in our cross.
   They depend on the alleles present at the same or other epistatically
   interacting loci. Genomic locations identified in this study include
   locations of candidate genes whose knockouts displayed similar aberrant
   maternal behavior. Behaviors significantly associated with maternal
   performance in this study include suckling, nest building,
   placentophagia, pup grooming, and retrieval of pups after disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{While theoretical models of the evolution of parental care are based on
   the assumption of underlying genetic variance, surprisingly few
   quantitative genetic studies of this life-history trait exist.
   Estimation of the degree of genetic variance in parental care is
   important because it can be a significant source of maternal effects,
   which, if genetically based, represent indirect genetic effects. A major
   prediction of indirect genetic effect theory is that traits without
   heritable variation can evolve because of the heritable environmental
   variation that indirect genetic effects provide. In the dung beetle,
   Onthophagus taurus, females provide care to offspring by provisioning a
   brood mass. The size of the brood mass has pronounced effects on
   offspring phenotype. Using a half-sib breeding design we show that the
   weight of the brood mass females produce exhibits significant levels of
   additive genetic variance due to sires. However, variance caused by dams
   is considerably larger, demonstrating that maternal effects are also
   important. Body size exhibited low additive genetic variance. However,
   body size exerts a strong maternal influence on the weight of brood
   masses produced, accounting for 22\% of the nongenetic variance in
   offspring body size. Maternal body size also influenced the number of
   offspring produced but there was no genetic variance for this trait.
   Offspring body size and brood mass weight exhibited positive genetic and
   phenotypic correlations. We conclude that both indirect genetic effects,
   via maternal care, and nongenetic maternal effects, via female size,
   play important roles in the evolution of phenotype in this species.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGE) of parental care performance and the
   direct-indirect covariance contribute substantially to total
   heritability in domesticated and laboratory mammals. For animals from
   natural populations empirical estimates of IGE are sparse. Thus, despite
   recent models relating IGE to evolution, evolutionary interpretations of
   IGE are limited. To address this deficit, we used a reciprocal
   cross-fostering breeding design to estimate environmental influences,
   direct and indirect genetic effects, and direct-indirect genetic
   covariances in the burying beetle Nicrophorus pustulatus to determine
   the evolutionary importance of IGE arising from variation in parental
   care performance. Carrion size positively affected adult mass and time
   on carrion, but had no effect on total development time. Males were
   slightly larger than females. For both mass and development, independent
   of these environmental influences, direct and indirect genetic effects
   were of moderate magnitude. Total genetic effects explained 36-50\% of
   the phenotypic variance in mass and size and 27-37\% of phenotypic
   variance in development time. Direct-indirect genetic covariances were
   zero or close to zero. Thus, for both mass and development time, the
   response to natural selection arising from environmental variation may
   be accelerated by the presence of IGE in N. pustulatus . The generality
   of this pattern and the evolutionary significance of IGE arising from
   parental care awaits further study of natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{The evolution of chemical communication in moths has implications for
   speciation because mate attraction and reproductive isolation are
   achieved primarily by unique blends of female-produced sex pheromones
   and the specificity of male responses to these signals. For most
   organisms, the genetics of speciation remains an open empirical
   question, but both major gene effects and additive genetic variation are
   likely to play roles in the diversification of chemical communication
   that accompanies speciation. In the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni
   (Hubner), a single gene mutation results in females that produce a
   drastically different signal. We conducted four wind-tunnel experiments
   to examine the potential role of additive genetic variation in the
   evolution of male T. ni response to this novel pheromone blend. The
   heritability of male response to both normal and mutant pheromone
   signals was tested in two experiments using a father-son regression
   design. Normal male response to the mutant blend showed a heritability
   of 0.25. The heritability of normal male response to the normal blend
   and the mutant male responses to both normal and mutant blends were at
   or near 0. In a third experiment, we imposed selection on normal male
   lines for increased response to the mutant pheromone blend. After three
   generations of selection, normal male response had increased by 24\% as
   compared to only 5\% in control lines, confirming the heritability value
   determined earlier. A fourth experiment showed that the change in the
   selected lines was due to an improved male response to both the normal

Abstract = {{Despite a growing interest in the evolutionary aspects of maternal
   effects, few studies have examined the genetic consequences of maternal
   effects associated with parental care, To begin to provide data on
   nonlaboratory or nondomestic animals. we compared the effect of presence
   and absence of parental care on phenotype expression of larval mass and
   development time at different life-history stages in the burying beetle
   Nicrophorus pustulatus. This beetle has facultative cared parents can
   feed their larvae through regurgitation or digested carrion or offspring
   can reed by themselves from previously prepared carrion. To investigate
   larval responses to these two levels of care, including estimates of
   additive genetic effects, maternal effects, and genotype-by-environment
   interactions, we used a half-sibling split-family breeding
   experiment-raising half of the offspring, of a family in the presence of
   their mother and the other hair without their mother present, Larvae
   reared with their mother present were on average headier and developed
   faster, although some of the difference in development decreased or were
   eliminated by the adult stage. These results suggest that presence or
   absence of post-hatching maternal care plays an important role in
   phenotype expression early in life, whereas later the phenotype of the
   offspring is determined mainly by the genotype and/or unshared
   environmental effects. Our study also permitted Lis to examine the
   differences in genetic effects between the two care environments.
   Heritabilities, maternal/common environment effect, and most genetic
   correlations did not differ between the care treatments. Genetic
   analyses revealed substantial additive genetic effects For development
   time but small effects for measures of body mass. Maternal Plus common
   environment effects were high for measure,, of mass hut low for
   development time. suggesting that indirect genetic effects or maternal
   and/or common environment are less important for the evolution of
   development time than for mass. Estimates of genetic correlations
   revealed a trade-off between the duration of the two development stages
   after the offspring left the carrion. There also a negative genetic
   correlation between the time spent on carrion and the mass at 72 h, when
   mothers usually feeding. The analysis of genotype-by-environment
   interactions indicates substantial among maternal families in response
   to care. Presence or absence of parental care may therefore contribute
   to the additive genetic variance through its interaction,with the
   maternal component of the additive genetic variance. The presence of
   this interaction further suggests that parent may vary in care
   strategies, with some parents dispersing after preparation of the
   carrion and some parents staving with the larvae. This interaction may
   help maintain genetic variation in growth, development time, and
   parental care behavior. Additional work is needed, however, to quantify
   indirect genetic effects, and genetic variation in parental care
   behavior itself.}},

   populations on their wild native conspecifics. Using published examples,
   we examine both the frequency of occurrence and the biological
   implications of situations in which released cultured fish have had
   direct genetic effects through introgressive hybridization, as well as
   indirect genetic effects such as induced through disease transfer,
   induced over-harvest, and displacement. These examples are contrasted
   with those instances where aquacultural activities have coexisted in
   harmony with underlying concerns related to issues of conservation
   genetics. Recommendations are made to guide industries, agencies, and
   managers toward these latter interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) occur when the phenotype of an
   individual, and possibly its fitness, depends, at least in part, on the
   genes of its social partners. The effective result is that environmental
   sources of phenotypic variance can themselves evolve. Simple models have
   shown that IGEs can alter the rate and direction of evolution for traits
   involved in interactions. Here we expand the applicability of the theory
   of IGEs to evolution in metapopulations by including nonlinear
   interactions between individuals and population genetic structure.
   Although population subdivision alone generates some dramatic and
   nonintuitive evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes, the
   combination of nonlinear interactions with subdivision reveals an even
   greater importance of IGEs. The presence of genetic structure links the
   evolution of interacting phenotypes and the traits that influence their
   expression ({''}effector traits{''}) even in the absence of genetic
   correlations. When nonlinear social effects occur in subdivided
   populations, evolutionary response is altered and can even oppose the
   direction expected due to direct selection. Because population genetic
   structure allows for multilevel selection, we also investigate the role
   of IGEs in determining the response to individual and group selection.
   We find that nonlinear social effects can cause interference between
   levels of selection even when they act in the same direction. In some
   cases, interference can be so extreme that the actual evolutionary
   response to multilevel selection is opposite in direction to that
   predicted by summing selection at each level. This theoretical result
   confirms empirical data that show higher levels of selection cannot be
   ignored even when selection acts in the same direction at all levels.}},

   include both direct and indirect genetic effects. Nan-additive genetic

Abstract = {{We argue that researchers interested in language and communication
   problems in mental retardation or any other developmental disorder
   should view such problems as emerging within the broader context of the
   behavioral profile, or phenotype, associated with a particular genetic
   condition. This will require understanding the direct and indirect
   effects of genes on the development of language and communication and
   thereby an understanding of the complex relations that exist between
   language and other dimensions of psychological and behavioral
   functioning as well as an understanding of the environments in which the
   developing person acts and is acted upon. We believe that the dominant
   model for understanding language and communication problems-the nativist
   approach, which emphasizes the child's innate capacity for acquiring
   language and characterizes language as consisting of a set of
   context-free deterministic rules that operate on abstract
   representations-is inconsistent with an emphasis on indirect genetic
   effects. We review recent evidence that undermines the nativist
   approach-evidence concerning the initial state of the language-learning
   child, the role of environmental input, the competence-performance
   distinction, and modularity. in place of nativism, we argue for
   Emergentism, which is a model in which language is seen to emerge from
   the interaction between the child's biological abilities to map
   statistical properties of the language input into a distributed
   representation and the characteristics of the language learning
   environment and for the purpose of engaging in real-time, meaningful
   language use. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Theoretical analyses have demonstrated a potential role for epistasis in
   many of the most important processes in evolution. These analyses
   generally assume that an individual's genes map directly to its
   phenotype and epistasis results from interactions among loci that
   contribute to the same biochemical or developmental pathways (termed
   physiological, or within-genotype, epistasis). For many characters,
   particularly those expressed early in life, an individual's phenotype
   may also be affected by genes expressed by its parents. The presence of
   these parental effects allows for interactions between the genes present
   in the parental and offspring genomes. When the phenotypic effect of a
   locus in the offspring depends on the alleles possessed by its parents,
   genotype-by-genotype. or among-genotype, epistasis occurs. The
   among-genotype epistasis resulting from parental effects may contribute
   to ruggedness of adaptive landscapes because early mortality often
   accounts for much of the variance in fitness in populations. To
   demonstrate how parent-offspring interactions can result in
   among-genotype epistasis, I use a two-locus model, with one maternal
   effect locus and one direct effect locus, each with two alleles.
   Dynamical equations are presented for the two-locus model and are
   directly contrasted with the dynamical equations derived for a model for
   physiological epistasis. The relationship between the evolutionary
   dynamics resulting from these two forms of epistasis is discussed. Three
   scenarios are presented to illustrate systems in which
   maternal-offspring, genotype-by-genotype epistasis may occur. The
   implications of maternal-offspring epistasis for quantitative-trait-loci
   studies are also discussed.}},

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{936-941}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Parents often have important influences on the development of traits in
   their offspring. One mechanism by which parents are able to influence
   offspring phenotype is through the level of care they provide. In
   onthophagine dung beetles, parents typically provision their offspring
   by packing dung fragments into a brood mass. Onthophagus taurus males
   can be separated into two discrete morphs: Large, ``major{''} males have
   head horns, whereas ``minor{''} males are hornless. Here we show that a
   switch in parental provisioning strategies adopted by males coincides
   with the switch in male morphology. Male provisioning results in the
   production of heavier brood masses than females will produce alone.
   However, unlike females in which the level of provisioning increases
   with body size in a continuous manner, the level of provisioning
   provided by males represents an ``all-or-none{''} tactic with all major
   males providing a Bred level of provisioning irrespective of their body
   size. Offspring size is determined largely by the quantity of dung
   provided to the developing larvae so that paternal and maternal
   provisioning affects the body size and horn size of offspring produced.
   The levels of provisioning by individual parents are significantly
   repeatable, suggesting paternal and maternal effects as candidate
   indirect genetic effects in the evolution of horn size in the genus
   Onthophagus.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic models of maternal effects and models of mate choice have
   focused on the evolutionary effects of variation in parental quality.
   There have been, however, few attempts to combine these into a single
   model for the evolution of sexually selected traits. We present a
   quantitative genetic model that considers how male and female parental
   quality (together or separately) affect the expression of a sexually
   selected offspring trait. We allow female choice of males based on this
   parentally affected trait and examine the evolution of mate choice,
   parental quality and the indicator trait. Our model reveals a number of
   consequences of maternal and paternal effects. (1) The force of sexual
   selection owing to adaptive mate choice can displace parental quality
   from its natural selection optimum. (2) The force of sexual selection
   can displace female parental quality from its natural selection optimum
   even when nonadaptive mate choice occurs (e.g. runaway sexual
   selection), because females of higher parental quality produce more
   attractive sons and these sons counterbalance the loss in fitness owing
   to over-investment in each offspring. (3) Maternal and paternal effects
   can provide a source of genetic variation for offspring traits, allowing
   evolution by sexual selection even when those trails do not show direct
   genetic variation (i.e. are not heritable). (4) The correlation between
   paternal investment and the offspring trait influenced by the parental
   effects can result in adaptive mate choice and lead to the elaboration
   of both female preference and the male sexually selected trait. When
   parental effects exist, sexual selection can drive the evolution of
   parental quality when investment increases the attractiveness of
   offspring, leading to the elaboration of indicator traits and higher
   than expected levels of parental investment.}},

Abstract = {{Cannibalism is widespread among many different organisms, and can have
   bath negative and positive fitness consequences. Avoiding eating
   relatives can minimize negative fitness consequences of cannibalism Such
   avoidance requires kin discrimination; but evidence for this ability
   among cannibals is Limited with little data that address the cues used
   in such discrimination. We examined whether larvae of the ladybird
   beetle Harmonia axyridis avoid eating their relatives. We further
   manipulated environmental factors to.,create individuals that had
   similar or dissimilar rearing environments to begin to test for
   endogenous versus exogenous recognition cues. Zn our experiments,
   third-instar larvae were much less likely to cannibalize if they were
   interacting with a relative. Larvae; that did cannibalize kin required
   more:encounters, and significantly delayed cannibalism, compared to
   larvae cannibalizing unrelated individuals. Acquired cues were less
   important. Even though the different rearing environment resulted in:
   significantly different phenotypic effects, similarity or dissimilarity
   of, rearing environment had no effect on cannibalism, and there was no
   interaction between environments and relatedness in cannibalism. We
   suggest that H. axyridis has a well-developed kin discrimination system,
   and that kin recognition in this ladybird beetle is based on endogenous
   rather than exogenous cues. We also argue that these cues reflect either
   direct or indirect genetic effects on larval phenotypes.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions often affect the fitness of interactants. Because of
   this, social selection has been described as a process distinct from
   other forms of natural selection. Social selection has been predicted to
   result in different evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes,
   including rapid or extreme evolution and evolution of altruism. Despite
   the critical role that social selection plays in theories of social
   evolution, few studies have measured the force of social selection or
   the conditions under which this force changes. Here we present a model
   of social selection acting on interacting phenotypes that can be
   evaluated independently from the genetics of interacting phenotypes. Our
   model of social selection is analogous to covariance model of other
   forms of selection. We observe that an opportunity for social selection
   exists whenever individual fitness varies as a result of interactions
   with conspecifics. Social selection occurs, therefore, when variation in
   fitness due to interactions covaries with traits, resulting in a net
   force of selection acting on the interacting phenotypes. Thus, there
   must be a covariance between the phenotypes of the interactants for
   social selection to exist. This interacting phenotype covariance is
   important because it measures the degree to which a particular trait
   covaries with the selective environment provided by conspecifics. A
   variety of factors, including nonrandom interactions, behavioral
   modification during interactions, relatedness, and indirect genetic
   effects may contribute to the covariance of interacting phenotypes,
   which promotes social selection. The independent force of social
   selection (measured as a social selection gradient) can be partitioned
   empirically from the force of natural selection (measured by the natural
   selection gradient) using partial regression. This measure can be
   combined with genetic models of interacting phenotypes to provide
   insights into social evolution.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Parents often have important influences on their offspring's traits
   and/or fitness (i.e., maternal or paternal effects). When offspring
   fitness is determined by the joint influences of offspring and parental
   traits, selection may favor particular combinations that generate high
   offspring fitness. We show that this epistasis for fitness between the
   parental and offspring genotypes can result in the evolution of their
   joint distribution, generating genetic correlations between the parental
   and offspring characters. This phenomenon can be viewed as a coadaptive
   process in which offspring genotypes evolve to function with the
   parentally provided environment and, in turn, the genes for this
   environment become associated with specific offspring genes adapted to
   it. To illustrate this point, we present two scenarios in which
   selection on offspring alone alters the correlation between a maternal
   and an offspring character. We use a quantitative genetic maternal
   effect model combined with a simple quadratic model of fitness to
   examine changes in the linkage disequilibrium between the maternal and
   offspring genotypes. In the first scenario, stabilizing selection on a
   maternally affected offspring character results in a genetic correlation
   that is opposite in sign to the maternal effect. In the second scenario,
   directional selection on an offspring trait that shows a nonadditive
   maternal effect can result in selection for positive covariances between
   the traits. This form of selection also results in increased genetic
   variation in maternal and offspring characters, and may, in the extreme
   case, promote host-race formation or speciation. This model provides a
   possible evolutionary explanation for the ubiquity of large genetic
   correlations between maternal and offspring traits, and suggests that
   this pattern of coinheritance may reflect functional relationships
   between these characters (i.e., functional integration).}},

Abstract = {{In systems where individuals provide material resources to their mates
   or offspring, mate choice based on traits that are phenotypically
   correlated with the quality of resources provided is expected to be
   adaptive. Several models have explored the evolution of mating
   preference where there are direct benefits to choice, but few have
   addressed how a phenotypic correlation can be established between a male
   indicator trait and the degree of parental investment. We present a
   model with three quantitative traits: male and female parental
   investment and a potential male indicator trait. In our model, the
   expression of the `'indicator'' trail in offspring is affected by
   parental investment. These effects are referred to as maternal or
   paternal effects, or as `'indirect genetic effects'' when parental
   investment is heritable. With genetic variation for degree of parental
   investment, offspring harbor genes for parental investment that an
   unexpressed before mating but will affect the investment that they
   provide when expressed. Because the in vestment received from the
   parents affects the expression of the indicator trait, there will be a
   correlation between the genes fur parental investment inherited and the
   degree of expression of the indicator trail in the offspring. The
   indicator trait is thus an `'honest'' signal for the degree of paternal
   investment.}},

Abstract = {{Interacting phenotypes are traits whose expression is affected by
   interactions with conspecifics. Commonly-studied interacting phenotypes
   include aggression, courtship, and communication. More extreme examples
   of interacting phenotypes - traits that exist exclusively as a product
   of interactions-include social dominance, intraspecific competitive
   ability, and mating systems. We adopt a quantitative genetic approach to
   assess genetic influences on interacting phenotypes. We partition
   genetic and environmental effects so that traits in conspecifics that
   influence the expression of interacting phenotypes are a component of
   the environment. When the trait having the effect is heritable, the
   environmental influence arising from the interaction has a genetic basis
   and can be incorporated as an indirect genetic effect. However, because
   it has a genetic basis, this environmental component can evolve.
   Therefore, to consider the evolution of interacting phenotypes we
   simultaneously consider changes in the direct genetic contributions to a
   trait (as a standard quantitative genetic approach would evaluate) as
   well as changes in the environmental (indirect genetic) contribution to
   the phenotype. We then explore the ramifications of this model of
   inheritance on the evolution of interacting phenotypes. The relative
   rate of evolution in interacting phenotypes can be quite different from
   that predicted by a standard quantitative genetic analysis. Phenotypic
   evolution is greatly enhanced or inhibited depending on the nature of
   the direct and indirect genetic effects. Further, unlike most models of
   phenotypic evolution, a lack of variation in direct genetic effects does
   not preclude evolution if there is genetic variance in the indirect
   genetic contributions. The available empirical evidence regarding the
   evolution of behavior expressed in interactions, although limited,
   supports the predictions of our model.}},

Abstract = {{Stocking of non-native Salmoninae into North American waters began
   around 1870.  Brown trout (Salmo trutta) from Europe established
   populations across North America and is the only successful
   inter-continental introduction.  Introductions of native salmonids
   within North America but outside their native ranges have been common. 
   Ecological effects of salmonid introductions, include competition,
   predation on native salmonids and other fishes, environmental
   modification through digging of redds in stream bottom substrates during
   spawning, and introduction of parasites and disease to native fish. 
   Direct genetic effects from stocked salmonids are caused by
   interbreeding with native species.  Indirect genetic effects may result
   through selective forces and/or a reduction of effective population
   size, genetic drift, and inbreeding.  Management actions used to remove
   non-native salmonid populations include chemical reclamation and
   construction of barriers to movement.  Salmonid stocking as a management
   practice is appropriate for species or population rehabilitation. 
   Continued stocking of non-native salmonids should cease where viable
   native salmonid populations exist.  New introductions of Eurasian
   species should not be made because effects are unpredictable. 
   Aquaculture and the creation of transgenic fish pose special threats to
   North American salmonids.  The era of widespread, intentional
   introductions of salmonids by man justifiably is drawing to a close.}},

   selection regimes or reductions in population size caused by
   competition, predation, disease, or other factors); and (3) genetic
   changes to hatchery stocks (through selection, drift, or stock

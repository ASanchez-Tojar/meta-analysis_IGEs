## Information about scripts, folders and files within:

Scripts:
-	[001_systematic_review.R](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/meta-analysis_IGEs/blob/main/001_systematic_review.R): used to import the results of the systematic literature review conducted in Web of Science and Scopus.
-	[002_fulltext_screening.R](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/meta-analysis_IGEs/blob/main/002_fulltext_screening.R): used to import the results of the title-and-abstract screening conducted using [rayyan](https://rayyan.qcri.org/) and to generate the database needed to proceed with the full-text screening phase.
-	[003_data_extraction.R](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/meta-analysis_IGEs/blob/main/003_data_extraction.R): used to import the results of the full-text screening and to generate the databases needed to proceed to the data extraction phase.
-	[004_dataset_cleaning.R](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/meta-analysis_IGEs/blob/main/004_dataset_cleaning.R): used to clean the meta-analytic dataset and generate the version for the analyses that is imported by [005_data_analysis.r](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/meta-analysis_IGEs/blob/main/005_data_analysis.r).
-	[005_data_analysis.r](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/meta-analysis_IGEs/blob/main/005_data_analysis.r): used to perform all the analyses.
-	[006_figures.r](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/meta-analysis_IGEs/blob/main/006_figures.r): used to generate the all figures included in the main text and the supplementary materials (except Figure 1 from the main text).

Folders:
-	[data](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/meta-analysis_IGEs/tree/main/data):
-	[figures](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/meta-analysis_IGEs/tree/main/figures): contains all figures generated by [006_figures.r](https://github.com/ASanchez-Tojar/meta-analysis_IGEs/blob/main/006_figures.r) and included in the main text and the supplementary materials (except Figure 1 from the main text).
